Is there another permission that isn't User Administrator that would allow them to enter some data in other fields? Namely, First and Last Name, Company Name and maybe even add them to some security groups? I'm an admin, so I see all of these fields when I'm adding guests.   Adding to the groups would be the cherry on top, but I understand group membership isn't the same thing as user properties.",
