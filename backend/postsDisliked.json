Read this\" note that lists quick tasks (two push-ups, drink water, inbox-zero a single email); 6) Keep a $10 kitchen timer on the desk to start 25-minute deep-work sprints; 7) Put the charger outside the bedroom and use a $15 alarm clock; 8) Give a friend your Screen Time passcode for the first 30 days; Results: daily pickups down ~40%, screen time -2h/day, sleep up 45 minutes, and I actually finish books again. If you try this, start with just Downtime + grayscale for a week. Happy to answer questions or share my Focus filters if helpful.",
