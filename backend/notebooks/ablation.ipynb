As repeatedly established throughout the franchise, the financial systems of Wizarding Britain and Muggle Britain are very, VERY different.  Going by 1991 when the first Harry Potter book takes place, Britain uses the Pound as its main currency, right?  Meanwhile, Wizarding Britain’s currency is the Knuts, Sickles, and Galleons.  Unless there is some kind of secret exchange rate mentioned somewhere in the franchise I have forgotten, due to the Wizarding World wanting to keep itself secret, Great Britain’s regular money is USELESS to wizards and witches unless it’s for collectors of Muggle stuff like Arthur Weasley.  So that said, say you’re a 10-11 year old who had never really experienced magic, when you’re suddenly given a petter by an owl saying you’ve been accepted to an arcane castle/boarding school you’ve NEVER heard of, and then told the first thing you need to do is buy your own school supplies.

The midterm that you disrupted by storming the classroom hallway while blaring instruments and chants is worth 60% of my grade. I spent weeks studying for it: I sacrificed time with my friends and doing things that I enjoy so I could perform well. Your actions stated that my time, my energy, and my goals don't matter; it was essentially a \"fuck you\" of the highest magnitude.  As a student here, this university is my home. It is a place for me to grow as a person and a scholar. As such, I am entitled to a nurturing learning environment that enables the best for me. You undermined that.  How could highly educated men and women of learning, who are also responsible for teaching students, find it morally feasible to actively sabotage students' learning outcomes? If you really don't give a fuck about students and student outcomes, then perhaps you should not even be a TA.  *just to clarify, the strikers did not leave after barging in, but instead stayed in the hallway 5 feet away from the students, screaming and blaring their noise-makers during the midterm.

      "self_text: I've recently been wondering, what exactly was it that made Anime like Naruto, One Piece, Bleach, Dragonball and Pokemon blow up as much as they did in the West, compared to many other titles. I know, that I've mentioned the big three in the title. However, this question in my opinion applies to all of the shows that became mainstream hits during the late 90s, early 2000s.  Was it the fact that those shows had plenty of episodes compared to other shows, especially coming out after or during the OVA craze of the 80s and 90s?  Or were they just better marketed and thus managed to reach the masses?  Or was it merely a coincidence, simply because they were aired at the perfect time for kids to watch after coming home from school?  Did they do anything so spectacularly different from other (western) shows that were airing at the time?  And most importantly, why have other (modern) Anime failed to replicate this success. Sure, we have new titles that are extremely successful like MHA, AoT or recently Chainsaw Man. But I'd argue that they are nowhere near as popular, especially outside of the Anime fandom.

I received a call the next day saying our puppy fractured her leg and they're not exactly sure how. They mentioned it was from \"normal play\" and that they were terribly sorry. They took our puppy to their vet, who took x-rays and revealed both her leg and knee were fractured, which would require surgery ASAP.  I find it very hard to believe this happened from just \"normal play\", but the boarding place keeps insisting this and when I requested for video footage, they claimed that their cameras do not store footage (which did not make sense to me). I did get written evidence through text that they claimed fault and that they would pay for our dog's surgery. However, prior to dropping our dog off, they had me sign a waiver freeing them of any liability if something were to happen.   Our dog had her surgery on Nov. 10, a little over 2 weeks ago, which costed $6,000 out of our pocket, and when I last contacted the boarding place yesterday, all they say is that they're working on it with their insurance. I do have pet insurance, but I would need to claim it within a month of the incident. Should I just claim it under my insurance since I am running out of time? Should I threaten with legal action?

The conversation ended with store telling me I was poisoning my dog and that corn is bad for dogs. Honestly, I just told them I believe real vets with certificates (I shared with them lots of tufts articles), and they told me that they prefer people who feed dog chow since they are poor and can't afford real food like, idk, Acana?  Looking at the certificates of those vets, they had DNM in their title, which is not a real university and the course looks like a bold 1990's webpage trying to sell you a scam.  When I showed them what WSAVA meant, articles on corn, on nutrition, on bacterial safety, they shut all down and just ended with \"good to have a debate but you are doing your dog wrong bye\" and never replied again.  It just bothers me because these people I bet do the same to lots of clients and try to use their credentials in order to fear monger others.  As an end note, I told them I think raw feeding is great IF you have a nutrition vet in charge of doing a balanced diet specifically for your dog, and that not all dogs do well on it.

      "self_text: Walter White is a thoroughly Nietzschean hero, one of the few compelling examples of such figures that American culture has ever produced. It was the philosopher Fried­rich Nietzsche who foresaw the predicament of Walter White, and of modern society, with uncanny clarity: We who inhabit modern societies are prone to a characteristic weakness, a pusillanimity in the face of the petty conventions and preoccupations of bourgeois existence. The fundamental challenge is to fashion a life that overcomes this debased condition, to rise from “last man” to “overman.” Some think that Nietzsche’s overman is an immoral, power-driven tyrant, who overcomes conventional morality by asserting a nihilistic will to power. But this is a misreading. Nietzsche’s overman rises above conventional morality not by embracing nihilism but by forging a narrative coherence to his life that issues in a kind of empowerment, or self-possession. The appeal of such empowerment, and of a hero who strives for it, is especially strong at this moment. In postrecession America, there is a mounting desire to throw off the straitjacket of a self-serving upper-middle-class morality that valorizes the sanctity of law and of “playing by the rules.” In many circles, there is a growing sense that the system is rigged, that the rules and conventions in place, defended in the name of fairness, efficiency, safety, or “win-win” economic arrangements, serve to empower some at the expense of others. Many find themselves enmeshed in absurd bureaucratic hierarchies—in work and in everyday life—that afford scant grounds for self-possession or self-respect. At the same time, there is a widespread sense that the “legitimate” economy fails to reward the effort and talents that ordinary people devote to their jobs. Instead, it heaps benefits on those who are simply lucky, or who manipulate the system, or who have a knack for getting rich off other people’s work (sometimes ruthlessly) while operating within the bounds of the law. People find themselves increasingly in the condition of Walter White—mired in routines of work that do not call forth their potential or accord them much dignity. Like Walt, many find themselves struggling to be recognized for the work they do, on the job or at home. It is against this cultural backdrop, I believe, that Breaking Bad still captivates public attention and illuminates the anxieties of our time. Nietzsche helps us interpret the improbable life story of Walter White and understand how Walt came to represent a kind of hero for this moment. Walt’s turn to crime is not simply a desperate move that spirals out of control—rather, it is a story of empowerment. In “breaking bad,” Walt rises to self-possession from a contemporary form of malaise and despair. Nietzsche also helps us understand the kind of self-possession Walt gains. On the surface, Walt’s trajectory might seem to suggest a grim, nihilistic drive to self-assertion through conquest: the way to truly live is to reject the social order in which you find yourself stifled and adopt a self-serving “live your own way” ethic. But this reading of Walter White is misguided. Walt does not simply despair of humanity and become a scornful manipulator of society who only enjoys domination over others. He is not the archetypal nihilist—like Roskolnikov from Crime and Punishment or Malvo from the re­cent TV series Fargo—who seeks destruction for its own sake. What makes Walt a complex protagonist, and what makes his tra­jectory moving, is that his “breaking bad” constitutes an attempt to forge a narrative coherence to his fractured and nearly expired life. Walt’s rise to power in the meth business can be understood, in Nietzschean terms, as an attempt to “redeem the past,” to reclaim a coherent whole out of the disparate parts of his life: his role as chemist, entrepreneur, husband, father, and even teacher. The self-possession for which he strives is thus bound up with a totality of commitments that cannot be captured by simple notions of egoism, selfishness, and conquest.  Nietzsche helps us diagnose the initial predicament of Walter White as the condition of the “last man,” a degenerate state of existence that Nietzsche identifies as pervasive in modern life. The last man, writes Nietzsche, enjoys “a little pleasure by day, and a little pleas­ure by night,” but always “with a regard to health.” The last man “has left the regions where it was hard to live” and ekes out an easy but hollow existence aimed at an ever-receding vision of repose. Absent from his life is any risk, adventure, or ambition: “‘What is love? What is creation? What is longing?’ Thus asks the last man, and he blinks.”1 Walter White is the last man, or very close to it. He is confined to a “little pleasure by day”—the breakfast of eggs, veggie bacon, and echinacea that his wife Skyler prepares for his fiftieth birthday—“a little pleasure by night”—the dispassionate, almost clinical hand job that she administers like medicine before bed—and all “with a regard to health.” Nietzsche’s “last man” captures a condition to which every life is susceptible. As we sympathize with Walter White, we acknowledge the possibility of the last man in ourselves. In one way or another, we’ve all been there before—in moments of enervation, lack of gumption, obsession with health, safety, and a long life, or earnest submission to the so-called necessities of a bourgeois existence. One of the brilliant conceits of Breaking Bad is its relentless exposure of the petty officiousness and stifling moralism of middle-class suburban life. The show constantly juxtaposes Walt’s harrowing travails and frank self-assertion in the underworld with the quotidian concerns and vapid, impersonal niceties of the law-abiding community. In extricating himself from the condition of the last man, Walt does not merely oppose his oppressive world with an angry “No!” He finds direction and rises to a kind of virtue that comes to light in Nietzsche’s conceptions of the “overman” and the “will to power.” Unfortunately, these key concepts are as liable to misinterpretation as Walter White himself. Due to misleading ideological appropriations of Nietzsche, and careless readings of his provocative aphorisms, we have a caricature of the “overman” as a kind of nihilistic lover of conquest who is above all ethics. But even a cursory reading of Nietzsche reveals a different conception. Even in his most “polemical” treatments of morality, as Nietzsche calls them, he makes clear that he seeks to promote one ethical framework over another, not to reject ethics in favor of “might makes right.” He seeks to replace a morality of weakness, timidity, and resentment with a morality of self-command. A first approximation of what Nietzsche means by “overman” is the passionate pursuit of life as an unfolding story: “What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not an end.”2 “Overman” is meant to point away from the “end,” the goal, the accomplishment, and toward the way. Life, Nietzsche suggests, is a ceaseless process of self-overcoming. “Overman” can thus be seen as a corrective to our “results-oriented” culture that interprets power as the capacity to get things done, to attain a certain standard of living, and to “make the world a better place.” To this extent, Nietzsche’s notion of overman is radi­cal and perhaps unsettling. Nietzsche sees in our obsession with accomplishment and progress a certain folly. He takes aim at the Enlight­enment view of providence that comes to paradigmatic ex­pression in Marx: the notion that humanity, through the technological mastery of nature, can solve the problem of scarcity and, through the attainment of a universal consciousness free of class difference and exploitation, bring about the perfectly just world.  found in r/okbuddychicanery\n",

      "title: How to find an accidentally hucked weapon?\n",
      "self_text: So last night I was building an outpost on the pavers bordering the upper yard. I went to relocate one of the storage chests when I accidentally hit the very ridiculously defaulted key to throw a weapon. It was a level 9 toenail scimitar. Sadly I was facing the koi pond and the thing flew off the edge of the paver and down into oblivion.   I spent over 45 minutes scouring the pond surface and depths where I estimated the weapon would have gone but to no avail. As I have upgraded my other weapons to high levels I don’t have any supreme whetstones left to get another one back to level 9.   I found that weapons sink in water but all searches came up empty. I know that dropped or thrown weapons have a proximity icon when you get close to them but that doesn’t always work. Why it doesn’t work is beyond me and clearly is not working as intended as I’ve lost arrows and other hucked items in the past but miraculously picked them back up by running over where they just happened to land but a weapon like this may as well be a needle in a haystack to find in the koi pond provided that’s where it is in the first place.   Will this weapon eventually despawn or will it be somewhere in the world waiting for me to find it by chance?  Here’s an idea for the devs: Make an item that was thrown ALWAYS show up on the HUD regardless of how far you are from it!!!!  While I know that you can remap the keys I would love to know who in the hell thought it was a great idea to default the huck key to R???\n",

      "self_text: I have watched behind the scenes clips, I have played this game, I have cried and I have been excited.  The amount of work and love that has been put down into this game is on a whole new level. The voice acting, the combat, the details, the amount of content, the story telling, the acting, the level design, the soundtrack, the accessibility options,  it is all amazing.  Me personally I dont like Elden Ring but I get why people like it.  But I strongly disagree that the same amount of love and care and professional work was put down into Elden Ring as they did with God of War. That is why God of War should win game of the year, end of story.  My personal opinion is that IF Elden Ring wins it is NOT because it deserves it, it is because it has a wider range of players. It is because X-Box players and PC players also voted for it and that is not fair.  So if you are an Elden Ring fanboy, I am sorry if this post hurts your feelings but I think that the best work done on a game should win the prize and at this moment God of War is by far the superior here.\n",

When a judge is looking at the teeth of a dog, are they only judging the bite/missing teeth/jaw alignment, or do they also judge tartar build up?  I looked at the AKC website and it doesn't mention tartar/dental health at all, apart from missing teeth.\n",

      "self_text: My sweet girl (13) has recently been diagnosed with very early kidney disease. The vet said she'll need regular blood tests, general checkups and blood pressure readings now to keep an eye on things. As well as changing her diet.   The blood tests and checkups are okay. But I took her in for her first blood pressure check today and it didn't work out. When the nurse came into the waiting room I stood up to go in with her, and the nurse said \"no no we'll take her into the back, you stay here\" and I immediately thought \"uh oh\". Her previous owner was abusive towards her and she only really trusts me. It took a long time to build the trust but we're thick as thieves now. The nurse came back after about 20 minutes and said they tried to get a reading about 20 times but my girl kept hissing, crying and jerking away. She said it was impossible and the only way we could maybe get a reading would be by booking a long appointment with the vet, and I hold her and keep her calm. But even then her blood pressure will be much higher and inaccurate because she obviously gets so stressed being there.   So I was wondering if anyone's had any success with doing home readings? Can I get a regular blood pressure machine and a small cuff, and then send the results in to my vet? Or is there anything else I can do to make this easier and less anxiety inducing for my baby?\n",

The whole idea of it really is to play Worldfire and then Jeska right after doing at least 1 damage to everyone at the table. If I can't do it immediately, then I play against the table with the one card draw shenanigans. I have low cost creatures to help me win after the Worldfire if necessary.   Starting with getting Tevesh out for the card draw and the possibility of doing the ultimate ability. I only cast Jeska after the Worldfire.   I don't have any swamps to avoid getting stuck after a worldfire. The Black mana I need usually either comes from treasures or dual lands (and the once in a while Phyrexian Altar).  I would like to make the deck faster and more reliable. Any thoughts or ideas are more than welcome. Thanks!\n",

Nobody is making you play. Fuck off. Go away. Toodles. Bye bye. Or play idc but stop whining every time you die and get better. So my question is; will there actually be any gameplay, tips, comedy or anything that isn’t whining 24/7?  Edit: Jesus fucking Christ the amount of people saying “ you’re whining about whining. Isn’t that ironic?” I’ll address this here since you stupid fucks can’t read. It was a question. Trying to see if that’s all this sub did. If you think I’m whining fine. If it’s ironic then cool. The fact that so many of you comment all the same shit speaks volumes about your ability to think for yourselves. Although that would require thinking and I’m pretty sure that’s a little advanced for you idiots. Also to clarify yes the game should be finished. Those complaints are valid. Any complaints about dying, guns, etc. are just you being shit and was the entire point of the post. Holy fuck you guys make my brain cells want to commit suicide.\n",

      "title: When is dog over emotional threshold using Julie Naismith method?\n",
      "self_text: I am using Julie Naismiths method to leave dog alone. So I am basically leaving the front door for a few seconds at a time, coming back before he is over his \"emotional threshold\" and repeat, repeat, repeat and eventually up the time by adding a few seconds at a time.  My question is what counts as over his emotional threshold? My dog will let out a whimper within 2 seconds of me leaving  and I'm finding it difficult to get any further if I use this cue as I am really just shutting the door and opening it again!   I left him longer, up to a min, to see what he done and he lets out a whimper which feels like more of a whine than a cry (?) and then lies down, looks relaxed, but continues to let out a wee whine every few seconds.  Would you say these little whines are over h threshold? Or is this just a little annoyance at being left and wouldn't count as over his emotional threshold? I would say he is definitely not stressed during this first min but from what I've read you should take any sign of being uncomfortable as over his emotional threshold for this method?  Appreciate any advice!\n",

      "title: Roger Waters Eurovision antisemite rant\n",
      "self_text: Good morning. I woke up about a quarter of an hour ago to an email from my friend Omar Baghoutti about the Eurovision Song Contest, and I thought immediately of a few choice-F’s. But three of them are as follows: First of all there’s a film, and that film was The Invasion of the Bodysnatchers. Eurovision reminds me of The Invasion of the Bodysnatchers. Because it seems it may have been taken over by… I believe they were aliens. I know it’s giving aliens a bad name, but, and at the end of the movie Donald Sutherland points at somebody and he— like this:  The Bodysnatchers are doing that now, but normally what they’re going is, “ANTISEMIIIIIIIIIIIITE!”  Alright. The fable is The Fable of the Emperor’s New Clothes. “Mommy, mommy, why is the emperor of Israel parading his ethnocentrist bullshit around naked?”  Okay, enough with nenya-ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh. The third F, and by far the most important one, is the subject of Omar’s messive to me, and that is that a hundre— it’s faith. Faith in my fellow human beings. Faith in their capacity for love and empathy.   136,000 of our Swiss brothers and sisters have signed and delivered a petition demanding that Eurovision pull out of the finals in Tel Aviv.  I cannot tell you how much that has lightened my morning. I’m gonna go make myself another cup of coffee with love in my heart for all those Swiss people. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n",

      "title: Suggestions from a returning player\n",
      "self_text: The game is becoming stale   I believe that after a few wipes there is very little content in the game to keep me interested. Battlestate Games have tackled this by implementing wipes and daily quests which are good addition to this, but not enough. For me, when I look back the most enjoyable aspect was learning the game, I believe that for the game to emulate this it would need to have major changes between wipes.  A few examples of this could be to change locations of: loot spawns, marked rooms, scav spawns, barter trades etc. Basically add some randomness that requires to relearn certain aspects of the game.  Also quests could change, instead of having the same quests Battlestate Games could create hundreds that alternate between each wipe. Or they could have a more personal approach and have a main theme or story each wipe which reflect on unique quests.  &#x200B;   Lobby for hackers   Hackers are clearly present in the game, which is natural due to the economic nature of the game. Although Battlestate Game has been doing a large amount of work to tackle them, they keep appearing. Clearly this approach doesn't seem to be working as the main problem is that the developers have to spend time dealing with hackers rather than adding content and improving the game.  The Cycle: Frontier, a looter shooter, has addressed the issue in a unique way. They use a system called trusted matchmaking, once a player becomes trusted they get matched to other trusted players. Cheaters are also pooled into their own lobbies. There are multiple factors that go into determining when you are trusted such as: numbers of hours played, lifetime of the steam account, stats in-game etc. Also if you get killed by a hacker the items you brought into the raid are returned back to you.  Although Battlestate Games may be hesitant to introduce any sort of \"matchmaking\" system, I believe this may be necessary to combat hackers.  &#x200B;   Reminders in main menu before joining raids   Currently if your health is low you when starting a raid you get a warning. I believe this is beneficial but should also be applied to other areas as well such as: low durability in armour, mags not filled, bags not empty, food and fluid is low.  I understand that EFT is a hardcore game and has little to no hand holding. However I don't believe forgetting to do something in the lobby is reflective of your in-game skill. Furthermore loading into a raid with the above negative effects detracts from the overall experience, it simply leaves you angry and frustrated. Games are primarily meant to be fun.  New players in particular are already having to learn a lot and will naturally forget some things, informing them of mistakes before they are made will increase player retention and enjoyment. Although I'm sure this also affects experienced players, the number of times I have died for forgetting to eat a drink is more than I can count over the course of several wipes.  &#x200B;   Filtering   The filtering in the game menu currently highlights items in set categories, however I don't think this is really helpful.  I believe instead a more useful approach would be to display an inventory with just the filtered items at the top, including anything in containers being brought out and shown.\n",
