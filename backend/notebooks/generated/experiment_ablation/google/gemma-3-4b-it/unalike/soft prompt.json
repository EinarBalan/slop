He says that I am being judgemental, but I was just trying to explain what I didn’t understand. He even went on to say that Islam is peaceful and that it’s wrong to judge people based on their religion.   However, he keeps bringing up the fact that he is Muslim. Like, why would he be offended by something I said about his religion? I think it’s fair to question things you don't understand. If it makes sense, then I have no issue with him believing in it, but if it doesn’t make sense, why do I have to pretend that I agree with everything he says? He said that I should not talk about his religion when he is around because it is rude. Is this true or just an excuse to try and get me to stop questioning him?   I’m wondering why he is so angry at me for saying this. Is he feeling judged or is he just making me feel guilty for asking questions? And more importantly, why does it seem like he is making me feel bad for simply questioning his belief system?",

They were written by God himself and given to Moses. They were written on parchment or papyrus scrolls, as it was the most common writing material at the time. So why does everyone believe they were written in stone? It's because of a misinterpretation of the Hebrew word “stone”. The Hebrew word for stone is “ezer”, which also means \"rock\" or \"foundation\". In the Old Testament, \"ezer\" refers to God’s strength and foundation. But when we read the Bible, we should understand it in its original context.   So what do you think? Do you believe the 10 commandments were written on stone?",

So I went to their church on Sunday, where the pastor gave a sermon about how God is angry at people who worship other gods (like Satan). He said that if you worship other gods, then God will punish you forever.  My grandparents told me that I needed to repent because I had been worshiping Satan for 6 years.

When I was 12, my family moved to Spain. The Spanish church is very different than the American church.

But now, the idea of being punished for eternity just seemed so ridiculous. I started reading the Bible and trying to figure out how Christianity fit into reality. I came across some things that made me think that maybe God isn't the angry judge that people make him out to be.  I started praying to God asking for guidance.
