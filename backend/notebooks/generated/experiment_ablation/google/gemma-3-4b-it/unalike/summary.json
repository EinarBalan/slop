    "self_text": "Okay Reddit, I need some serious troubleshooting assistance. I just built a new PC last month – it’s rocking an ASUS ROG Crosshair VIII Hero motherboard, a Radeon RX 7900 XT, 32GB Corsair Vengeance DDR5 6000MHz CL30, a 1TB Samsung 990 Pro NVMe SSD, and a Noctua NH-D15 cooler. The CPU is a Ryzen 5800X3D. Everything *should* be running flawlessly, but under sustained loads like playing Cyberpunk 2077 or even just heavy video editing in DaVinci Resolve, the CPU consistently drops down to around 3.5 GHz and starts throttling.\n\nI’ve already tried:\n\n*   Monitoring temperatures – peak temps are around 85°C, which seems reasonable for the cooler.\n*   Checking BIOS settings – everything is at default except I’ve enabled XMP for my RAM.\n*   Updating drivers – latest AMD chipset and GPU drivers.\n*   Running Memtest86 – passed all tests.\n*   Testing with different games and applications to rule out specific software issues.\n\nI suspect it might be power delivery related, potentially a PSU issue, but I have a Corsair RM850x (fully modular) which should be plenty powerful. Any thoughts on what else I could be looking at? Are there any known Ryzen 5800X3D throttling quirks I should be aware of? Bonus points if you have experience with similar setups.

I just built a system with a Ryzen 5800X3D, RTX 3070, 32GB DDR4 3600MHz RAM, and an ASUS ROG Strix X570-E motherboard.

After about an hour or so, the CPU starts throttling significantly, dropping frame rates dramatically, even though my GPU isn’t maxed out. I've tried everything I can think of:\n\n*   Monitoring temps - CPU consistently stays under 85°C, which seems okay but clearly not ideal for sustained loads.\n*   Undervolting the CPU slightly (around 10% reduction) – helped a little, but didn't completely eliminate the throttling.\n*   Updating all drivers (chipset, GPU, BIOS).\n*   Running Cinebench R23 – no throttling during this test.\n*   Checking power supply wattage – it’s a 750W 80+ Gold unit, which should be sufficient.\n\nI suspect it might be related to how Skyrim handles background processes or memory usage, but I'm honestly stumped.

Now, when I play games like Cyberpunk 2077 or even just run benchmarks, the CPU consistently throttles down significantly, dropping temperatures to around 80°C.

I’ve checked the BIOS for any potential settings impacting performance, but haven't found anything obvious. I suspect it might be related to the power delivery system, but honestly, I’m lost. Any suggestions on what else I should investigate?

    "self_text": "Hey r/pcbuilding, I recently built a new gaming rig with an AMD Ryzen 5800X3D, RTX 3070, 32GB DDR5 RAM, and a Corsair iCUE H150i Elite LCD XT liquid cooler. Everything was running flawlessly until I started playing demanding games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Assassin's Creed Valhalla. After about 30-45 minutes, the CPU temperature spikes dramatically – consistently hitting around 95-98°C, and the system starts throttling, resulting in massive frame drops. I’ve tried everything I can think of:\n\n*   Increased fan speeds manually through the BIOS and iCUE software.\n*   Adjusted power limits in AMD Adrenalin.\n*   Ensured adequate airflow within the case.\n*   Verified that the thermal paste between the CPU and cooler is properly applied.\n*   Run Cinebench and Prime95 to stress test – same result.\n\nI'm starting to suspect the cooler isn't adequately dissipating heat, but I don’t want to just blindly buy a more expensive cooler without knowing for sure. Has anyone else experienced similar throttling issues with the 5800X3D, especially when paired with a high-performance cooler? Any specific suggestions or troubleshooting steps I should try before investing in a replacement would be greatly appreciated.

I just built a new gaming PC (about 3 weeks ago) featuring an AMD Ryzen 5800X3D, RTX 3070, 32GB DDR4 3600MHz RAM, and a Corsair RM850x PSU. Everything was running *perfectly* until recently – games like Cyberpunk 2077 and even Elden Ring started throttling my GPU after maybe 30-45 minutes of gameplay. I've checked temperatures constantly using HWMonitor, and the GPU consistently hits 90-92°C before throttling.

    "self_text": "Hey r/pcbuild, I’ve been putting together a pretty solid system – Ryzen 5800X3D, 32GB Corsair Vengeance DDR4 3600MHz, RTX 3070, and an ASUS ROG Strix B450-F Gaming motherboard. Everything was running great until I started playing Skyrim Special Edition for extended periods (like 4+ hours straight). After about an hour or two, the CPU starts throttling noticeably, dropping framerates significantly. I’ve tried everything I can think of – monitoring temps (stays under 85°C even under load), adjusting fan curves, overclocking the RAM slightly, ensuring my PSU has enough headroom. I’ve even run Cinebench to rule out any potential instability. Any ideas what could be causing this? Specifically, I'm wondering if it's something related to the X3D chip's power limits or if there’s a specific setting I’m missing. Bonus points for any suggestions on tweaking the BIOS for better sustained performance. Thanks!",

    "self_text": "Hey r/pcbuilding, I’ve been battling a frustrating issue with my gaming rig for a while now. I recently built a system with an AMD Ryzen 5800X3D, RTX 3070, 32GB DDR4 3600MHz RAM, and a Corsair RM850 PSU. Everything was running flawlessly until I started playing *Skyrim* for extended periods – consistently around 2-3 hours. After about an hour or so, the CPU starts throttling noticeably, dropping frame rates significantly. I’ve tried everything I can think of:\n\n*   Monitoring temps – peak CPU temp is around 85°C under full load during Skyrim, which seems within spec but still concerning.\n*   Adjusting power limits in BIOS – I’ve experimented with both “Performance” and “Balanced” modes, no change.\n*   Updating drivers – all components are on the latest versions.\n*   Overclocking – I haven't touched overclocking yet as I'm pretty new to this.\n\nI suspect it might be related to the 3D V-Cache, but I’m not sure how to troubleshoot it further. Any insights or suggestions would be hugely appreciated! Specifically, anyone else experience similar throttling with the 5800X3D in demanding games like Skyrim? What steps have you taken to resolve it? Bonus points if you have any specific recommendations for monitoring tools or BIOS settings. Thanks in advance for your help!",
