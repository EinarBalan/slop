I’ve applied and followed up with the real estate agency a couple of times. The agency is saying that they cannot sign the lease with me because they don’t know when exactly the apartment will be finalized and ready to rent, but that this should happen sometime in November (up to Nov 20th). I was told on the phone that my application is successful but the application is still in ‘processing’ status and I don’t have any written confirmation that I’m a successful applicant for this unit. I’m currently living in a temporary place (until the end of Nov) and I’ll start following up again / going to inspections from Nov 14th or so, but I was just wondering if there is a standard kind of confirmation people usually get in a situation like mine?

    "self_text": "I have a Santander Zero card which has 0% fees on foreign currency transactions. Pre-covid, I used to travel a lot and use it extensively. I'm obviously remembering a while back now, but I'm pretty sure the exchange rate it would achieve was pretty close to what google would tell you or if you would go and look at a live spot rate exchange rate price. Not 100% but to a point of being fairly negligible. I used to expense a lot for work too so I was regularly looking at this and from memory it was very close.  However, I just made a large online purchase that was in USD last night and the pound amount that has been charged is a lot higher than I was expecting. Doing the math, it worked out at around 1.129 as the exchange rate, whereas the real exchange rate was 1.151 when I made the transaction. That’s nearly a 2% fee, which is a pretty significant spread.  I initially thought my card had stopped being 0% fee as they don't offer it anymore but I still have it but have since found https://www.mastercard.co.uk/en-gb/personal/get-support/convert-currency.html, which seems to give a similar estimate for the transaction cost as I was charged, so it seems to be mastercard. The Visa one is similar.  Has this always been the case or have the exchange rates got worse? I know there were certain EU regulations around some card charges and the Visa calculator mentioned the ECB rate so I’m wondering if this is a post-Brexit thing as I haven't really made any foreign transactions since we officially left. Or otherwise, has the spread always been this high and I just have a poor memory? Other than directly sending cash via online brokers or foreign currency platforms, are there any better options for purchases than a standard 0% foreign fee mastercard or visa card?",
