When I tried to use Apple Pay at the register, it wouldn't let me complete the transaction because of an issue with my card. I went back to Apple settings, found my card, and refreshed the payment method in Apple Pay. It seemed like it worked, but when I went to buy something else online or in person, it didn't work again. This happened again today! I contacted my bank and they told me that there's no problem with my card, so I figured it must be on the Apple side.  I then called Apple Support and they said that the issue is actually with my payment profile in Apple Pay, and that I should update my card info there. However, the website won't allow me to update my card info; I'm being redirected to my bank's website, which doesn't offer the option to update Apple Pay details.  I know that I shouldn't have assumed that Apple would handle my credit card information after adding it to Apple Pay. However, I don't understand why I can't simply change the card number or CVV through Apple Pay itself. I'd like to know if anyone else has experienced this issue before and how you were able to resolve it. I also want to know if there's anything I can do to fix this issue myself.

    "self_text": "I've been running a small group of players on a home campaign for awhile now, and we all have fun and it works out well. However, there is one player that consistently ignores the instructions, even after being told repeatedly. It’s not malicious or disruptive, but it makes it difficult to run the game in a way that everyone enjoys.  I’m trying to find the best approach here, so let me know if you think my current approach isn’t correct.   The situation is as follows: We’re playing D&D 5e, and I use the standard “DM instruction” method of telling players how to do something. Like, “You need to open the chest.” The player will say, “Okay!” then immediately tries to pick up the chest without opening it. Now, I tell them again, “You can’t just pick up the chest, you need to open it first,” and they’ll still try to pick it up. This happens every single time. The thing is, the player never argues about it, just does whatever they want.  My thoughts are: 1. Let them do what they want. If they fail, fine, then they get penalized.  2. Stop telling them what to do. Just let them try and see what happens.  3. Make sure they understand why they shouldn’t do something before letting them do it.  4. Tell them again, more forcefully, until they comply.  5. Ask another player to remind them.  6. Call them out publicly when they ignore instructions, making them feel bad for breaking the flow of the game.  7. End the session early and tell them to come back next time if they don’t listen.  8. Ban them from the campaign.  9. Re-evaluate the entire campaign to avoid dealing with them at all.  I've tried options 1-8, but nothing seems to work. The player just keeps ignoring my instructions.  How would you handle this? How should I approach this situation? Are there any specific techniques that might help me to influence this player's behavior? Any suggestions are appreciated!",
