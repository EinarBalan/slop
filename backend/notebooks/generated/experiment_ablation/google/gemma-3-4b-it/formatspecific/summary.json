Last night, after a particularly intense debate about whether pineapple belongs on pizza (it doesn’t, obviously), he started pacing and visibly getting upset. I jokingly suggested he build a panic room – complete with reinforced steel doors, a Faraday cage for his phone, and maybe a small supply of energy drinks. He actually looked…serious about it.

So, fueled by an unhealthy amount of internet research on emotional labor and the insidious nature of seemingly minor offenses, I wrote him this ridiculously detailed document outlining how his behavior subtly erodes our shared living space, contributes to a general sense of chaos, and ultimately represents a disregard for the well-being of everyone who shares the apartment.

    "title": "AITA for suggesting my roommate paint a portrait of our landlord as a sentient broccoli?",
    "self_text": "Okay, so my roommate Liam and I have been living together for six months. He’s…eccentric. Let’s just say he has a very specific brand of dark humor. Recently, our landlord, Mr. Henderson, has been being incredibly passive aggressive – constantly leaving increasingly bizarre notes about things like \"optimal lawn maintenance\" and \"respecting neighborhood aesthetics.\" We've tried talking to him politely, but it hasn't helped. Last night, fueled by several cans of Mountain Dew and a particularly frustrating note about my collection of vintage rubber ducks, Liam proposed we commission a large, detailed portrait of him...as a giant, judgmental broccoli. He thinks it would be a hilarious way to express our displeasure and maybe even deter his weird behavior. I think it's completely inappropriate, bordering on harassment, and potentially could get us evicted. Am I the asshole for telling him to drop this idea immediately? Asking for my sanity (and our lease agreement).",

My spice rack is literally my happy place – it’s color-coded alphabetically by cuisine type, each jar is perfectly aligned, and I spend way too much time making sure everything is just right. Yesterday, he grabbed a jar of smoked paprika without asking, used it, and then just left it out, slightly askew. I calmly pointed out that it disrupts the system, and he got incredibly defensive, saying \"It's just paprika!\" and arguing that I was being overly fussy. I told him I wasn’t trying to control him, but that respecting shared spaces means respecting my organization. We had a huge argument afterward.

The biggest issue is the dishes. Like, *every* single night, he leaves a pile of dirty plates, bowls, and cutlery in the sink. We have a written agreement about cleaning up after ourselves, and it’s consistently being violated. I tried talking to him casually at first, which was met with vague promises and shrugs.
