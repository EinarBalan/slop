My grandmother passed away this summer and in her will I was left a small home in the college town that I live in. This house was where I (as well as my siblings and some other members of my family) lived while we pursued our degree(s). She (my grandmother) made rent equal to expenses + a bit extra to cover regular maintenance; it was a stellar deal for college, and it holds a lot of fond memories—I feel very fortunate to have received this house and intend on continuing her legacy with the space. I have told my family (there are 4 remaining cousins who are not college aged yet), that I intend on continuing renting the house out at cost to family members if they chose to pursue a degree at the college where this house is located (or if they choose to take a job in the area during their \"college age years\"). Here is where the dilemma comes in, when I made this announcement, I received a call from a cousin who is currently attending a different college that is nowhere near the home I inherited. She wanted to know how much I intended on sending her for her housing when she moved off campus next fall—as my grandmother did give some money to her grandchildren who chose not to go to college where the house was (not nearly enough to make the deal that the house was, but from my understanding it was equal to a couple hundred dollars a month). And when I told her I was not planning on sending ANY money for her housing, she went off screaming that I was disgracing my grandmother’s legacy and that she would have wanted me to fulfill the entire legacy of college housing generosity. I am not a wealthy person—I did not receive any money in the inheritance -- just the house. And even that, I have had to spend a fair amount of money in repairs to get the home back to prime condition as non-family tenants had moved out during her passing and they took advantage of the lack of supervision during the legal red tape surrounding the house. I told her that even if I wanted to fulfill the whole legacy, I didn’t have the money and that that was it. Now I have family members calling stating that I am now forcing their children to choose this school near the house, when everyone else got to choose.
