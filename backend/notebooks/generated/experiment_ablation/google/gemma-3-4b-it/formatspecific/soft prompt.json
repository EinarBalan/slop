    "title": "AITA for not letting my dad watch a film I've seen over 10 times?",
    "self_text": "My dad (68) has been going through some stuff recently and he's been really into watching movies to keep his mind off things, which is great! However, I've watched the film in question about 12 times now, so he asked me if he could watch it with me.  I said no but he kept asking and I told him \"you're gonna hate it\". He didn't seem to care and just kept asking. So I went on my phone, opened up my browser and played the film. When he tried to play it from his device he got an error message that said \"invalid file\". After looking at his device I realised he was trying to play the file without the correct codecs installed.  I told him that his device doesn't have the right codec installed and that it won't work.  He then looked at his phone again and I saw that he had found a YouTube video of the same film.   He started watching it.  I sat next to him as he watched and we both agreed it was awful. But still he kept telling me how much he loved it. I don't think he actually understood what was happening or the reason why he couldn't watch it from his device.  My mom has been saying that I should let him watch it because he wants to. She says that I am being selfish and childish. She also added that I shouldn't be getting angry when he asks me these questions.  I feel like I did nothing wrong and I don't want to let him ruin his experience. Am I the asshole?",

    "self_text": "I (18F) have been friends with my best friend, Alex (19M), since like 6th grade. We've always done everything together and we are super close. Over the summer, Alex told me that he was going on a camping trip to the mountains with 5 other people from our school. They were planning it for weeks and all of them were super excited about it.   I asked if I could come along but they said no because there wasn't room for everyone. I understood this, so I didn't get upset.  A few days later, Alex texted me saying that his dad had just got a new job in a different state and that he would be moving next month. He also said that he wanted to go on another trip before leaving so he invited me to join him on this trip as well. I was ecstatic and said yes immediately. I was looking forward to it so much!   The day of the trip came, and I was really excited to see Alex. When I got there, I saw him and his friends at the entrance of the trail head. I walked over to say hello and started talking to Alex. After about an hour, Alex told me that he needed to leave early because something came up and he couldn't stay longer than a few hours. He said that he had to go home to pack some things up. As he was walking away, I called out \"I'll see you soon!\" but he didn't hear me.   As I was leaving, I noticed that the others were laughing at something I said, which made me feel bad because I thought they were trying to be nice. I then realized that they didn't invite me or include me in anything they were doing. It was only after I was gone that I heard that they had spent the whole time playing games and telling jokes without ever even mentioning me. I felt incredibly hurt because I felt like Alex and his friends were intentionally excluding me. Then, I decided to text Alex to ask why he didn't tell me that he was going on a trip with other people. To this day, he hasn't responded to any of my texts. I was hoping that I wouldn't have to find out the reason through someone else, but now I am starting to wonder what went wrong. It was the first time that I felt betrayed by Alex.   So yeah, that's the story. Do I deserve this feeling of being upset or should I be more understanding?",

It turned out she'd just started dating my bf last month so it wasn't like I was trying to exclude her from anything. I didn't invite her to Christmas dinner because she hadn't known us long enough yet and I thought it would be weird for her to be there, but I did bring her along to all of his family's other events. I felt bad about it at first, but then I realised it was only one Christmas dinner.  I feel like I'm an asshole if I don't invite her next year, but I also feel like I shouldn't have made her go to Christmas dinner in the first place. What do you think?",

My team is usually pretty good about helping each other out with ideas and brainstorming stuff, but my coworker has been coming up with some weird ideas lately. It started as an offhand comment in a meeting about how to help increase sales, but she went on and on about her idea for weeks. The thing is, it's so stupid that I feel like I can't even be polite to her about it. We were talking about what our next step should be (we were trying to come up with ways to engage more customers) and she said \"We could make a TikTok video series about the benefits of our product.\" I thought that was a terrible idea because not many people would actually watch tiktok videos. So I told her \"I don't think that'll work\" and she replied \"Why?\" and I said \"Because no one will watch tiktok videos.\" She then said \"Well you just don't understand tiktok\", which made me annoyed. At this point, I felt like I had to say something to shut her down, so I said \"That's a really bad idea\". I didn't mean to hurt her feelings or anything, and I apologized after saying it. She got angry and said she wanted to talk to my manager about it. I tried to explain why I thought it was such a dumb idea, but she wouldn't listen.

My boss was furious and screamed at me to not make requests like that again because she would have to deal with them. It’s been a week since then and he still hasn’t made any mistakes.

It didn't start off too bad, at first they were really sweet to each other, and we would all go on family trips or activities and it was always fun. But then things slowly went downhill, and now everything is just full of yelling and fighting and me being told that I can never see my friends because I'm \"too busy\" with school or that I can't ever leave my room because I'm \"working too hard.\"  I think it started happening around last year when my dad lost his job and he was really upset and angry about it and my mom had to take up multiple jobs to make ends meet. He'd be working late nights and coming home exhausted and my mom would be stressed out trying to keep the house running and get me through school. Then when he finally got a new job he said he was going to work on himself and turn over a new leaf but nothing has changed. The same thing happens every single day. I've tried talking to both of them about how I feel, but they just shut me down.

    "self_text": "I was at the mall with my friend and we went to see the movies. Then she asked me if I wanted to go to the food court. I said yes so we got in line for our order. When we were about to pay, her friend came up and said “I’m going to get some fries” then she turned around and started crying. At first, I didn’t know why she was crying but then she told me that it wasn't because of the fries. She told me she had just gotten dumped by her boyfriend. It was really sad and I tried to comfort her. We ended up leaving the food court and watching a movie together. As we were watching the movie, she kept saying how bad things were, but nothing seemed to change. Then she started screaming at me and asking why I never text her back. I told her I hadn’t been able to because my phone died. After that, she started to cry again. I tried to calm her down and tell her everything would be alright. But she wouldn’t stop crying. So, I did something stupid. I took out my phone and played music from spotify. Then I told her that I liked her hair and that I thought she looked really cute. She was quiet for a few seconds and then she screamed at me. I told her I wasn't trying to make her feel bad or anything. I was just being nice. She said \"you think you're better than everyone else?\" Then she started yelling and saying all kinds of insults. I apologized and said I didn't mean any harm. She continued to yell until the end of the movie. She left me alone after that and I was really confused. I walked home with my friend and we talked about everything. I noticed that when she said I didn’t like her hair, it was because she was insecure about herself. But she kept saying it over and over. She was always talking about how ugly and awkward she was. And then she went on and on about how much she hated her own life. She was so caught up in her own misery and insecurities. It made me sad because she deserved to be happy. It made me want to take her hand and tell her that everything would be okay. But I knew that wouldn't work. She was too stubborn to let anyone help her. The more I watched her, the more I realized that she was a little bit crazy. I didn’t understand what was going on in her head. She was so lost in her own thoughts and feelings. I don’t know why she was acting so strange. Maybe she was just having a bad day. Or maybe she was dealing with something really difficult that she couldn't talk about. Whatever it was, it was making her miserable. I felt bad for her. She was such a beautiful girl but she couldn’t seem to appreciate herself. And she was always complaining about everything. I wished she could find happiness and peace. But I knew that she probably wouldn’t. She was trapped in a cycle of sadness and negativity. It broke my heart to watch her struggle. I wish I could have done something to help her. I wish she could have seen herself as worthy of love and happiness. But she was too blinded by her own insecurities to realize that. It was a really sad experience. I learned a lot about myself that day. I realized that I am an empathetic person and that I care deeply about other people. I also realized that sometimes people are struggling with problems that they can’t share. It makes me want to reach out to them and offer support. But I know that I can’t solve their problems. All I can do is be there for them and let them know that they aren’t alone. I hope that someday they will find the strength to overcome their challenges and live happy lives.  I saw her walking down the street and she was wearing a black dress. She was looking really sad. I waved at her but she didn’t notice me. I wanted to call out to her and ask her if she was okay. But I didn’t want to bother her. I didn’t want to make her feel worse. I just wanted to let her know that I cared. I was thinking about her later that night. I wondered if she was still sad. I hoped that she had found someone who could make her laugh. I hoped that she had finally accepted herself for who she is. I hoped that she had found happiness. But I knew that those wishes might not come true. I knew that she might continue to struggle with her emotions and insecurities. But I still wanted to believe that she could find peace. I wanted to believe that she could finally escape her prison of sadness. I wanted to believe that she could finally be free. I’ve been spending time with Astra lately and it’s been really weird. She has this habit of talking to herself, and she often says things that make no sense. Sometimes she starts arguing with herself, which is pretty unsettling. Yesterday, I overheard her telling herself that she’s a failure and that nobody likes her. It was heartbreaking to hear her say those things. I tried to comfort her, but she just pushed me away. It seems like she’s really struggling with some serious issues. I don’t know how to help her. She’s like a normal person, but she does these bizarre things that make me question her sanity. I’m worried about her, and I don’t know what to do. Is it possible for her to get better? Or is she doomed to spend the rest of her life suffering? I need some advice. This isn’t easy for me. I feel like I’m trapped in a nightmare. I’m starting to lose my mind. I don’t know what’s real anymore. Astra keeps insisting that she’s a princess and that she deserves to be treated like royalty. She demands to be served meals on silver platters and insists on being addressed as “Your Highness.” It’s exhausting and frankly, terrifying. She says she's lived through centuries and has forgotten her name, but that she remembers being a queen.  She keeps trying to convince me that I’m her servant and that I should obey her every command. I tried reasoning with her, but she simply laughs and tells me that I’m delusional. It’s driving me insane.  I’m beginning to think she’s either completely losing her mind or she’s playing some elaborate game. I don’t know what to do. I need to get out of here before she drives me completely crazy.  She’s convinced that she’s a mermaid and spends most of her time staring out at the ocean, whispering to the waves. She claims to communicate with dolphins and sea turtles, and insists that they’re sending her messages. She even tries to swim in the bathtub, despite the fact that she can’t actually swim. I’ve tried to gently suggest that she’s imagining things, but she just gets angry and accuses me of doubting her. It’s incredibly frustrating. I’m starting to worry about her mental health. I don’t know what to do. I need to find a way to help her without alienating her further. I wish I could just snap my fingers and make her normal again.  She believes she’s a powerful witch and spends hours brewing potions and casting spells. She uses random ingredients like coffee grounds, spices, and old socks to create her concoctions. She insists that these potions have magical properties and that she can use them to control the weather, heal illnesses, and even bring people back from the dead. I’ve tried to explain to her that these ingredients are completely harmless and that her beliefs are based on fantasy, but she refuses to listen. She’s convinced that she possesses incredible powers and that she needs to use them responsibly. I’m starting to fear for her safety. If she truly believes she has the ability to manipulate reality, she could easily hurt herself or others.  I wish I could protect her from her delusions. I don’t know how long I can keep pretending to believe in her magic. I need to find a way to intervene before it’s too late. I'm starting to think she's a robot. She doesn't react to anything, she just stares blankly ahead. She eats and sleeps, but only when prompted. When I try to engage her in conversation, she responds with generic phrases like \"That's interesting\" or \"Okay.\" She doesn't show any emotion whatsoever. I've taken her to doctors, but they say she's perfectly healthy. They attribute her lack of response to depression. I don't buy it. She's not depressed; she's just...empty. Like a shell. I'm starting to wonder if she's actually a machine. I've started researching robotics and AI, and I'm finding a lot of similarities between her behavior and the characteristics of advanced robots. Could she be a prototype? Or perhaps a secret government experiment? I'm obsessed with the idea now. I spend all my time trying to figure out how she works, what motivates her, and where she comes from. I've even started building my own robot. I'm hoping that by creating my own artificial intelligence, I can unlock the secrets of hers. It feels like I'm slowly losing my grip on reality. I'm questioning everything I thought I knew about human nature. Is it possible that we're all just complex machines? That consciousness is nothing more than a simulation? I'm starting to feel like a prisoner in my own mind. I need to break free from these questions. I need to find a way to reconnect with humanity. But how can I do that when I don'",

I replied with \"yes\" and she replied with \"oh ok\" once again without any further questions or concern. I found out that the flight was actually cancelled due to weather conditions and that the airline was offering refunds and rebooking options.

    "self_text": "I don't know how to feel about it. As far as I know, racism is defined as prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against a person or people based on their membership in a particular racial or ethnic group.  I find it difficult to accept such a definition because it seems too simple.  A lot of times, racism comes from ignorance and misunderstanding. If someone doesn't know much about other cultures or ethnicities, then they might make assumptions about others. It can be very damaging for everyone involved. Racism can also come from power. Someone with a lot of power could use it to discriminate against someone who has less power. I don't think anyone does this on purpose though, at least not all the time. Most people just don't realize that they are doing it. However, there is something weird about this guy's situation. He wants to have a kid with someone of another race, but he doesn't want the kid to be in contact with people of another race. What does that mean? This guy clearly is prejudiced. It's not clear whether it's intentional or unintentional, but it definitely isn't cool.   What do you guys think?",

Now she's actually an amazing student who is really proud of herself. It's nice to see someone so happy with their achievements. However, she also has some issues that cause her to be extremely sensitive. If you say anything bad about her, she can get upset for hours. She is constantly crying over the smallest things. As a result, I haven't really spoken to her in months because of the stress that comes from having to worry about hurting her feelings. She doesn't want to talk about her problems, so I just avoid it. However, there are times when I feel like she needs help more than me. Yesterday, I saw her at the mall and she seemed sad, so I tried to cheer her up by telling her how great she looked today. But she started sobbing uncontrollably and said I shouldn't even be talking to her. I was confused why she reacted so strongly. I didn't mean to make her sad, I just wanted to compliment her. Then, I realized that I had gotten carried away and made it sound like I was trying to start a fight. I apologized to her immediately and told her I wasn't trying to offend her. She started yelling at me and accusing me of not caring about her. I was shocked by her reaction. I've never seen her act so angry. I told her that I do care about her, but I don't want to see her cry every time I say something. She then stormed off and left me standing there alone. Later that day, I realized that my behavior could have been perceived as offensive. I was being too forceful in my compliments and didn't consider her sensitivity. I should have been more mindful of her emotions. It seems like I may have gone too far in trying to cheer her up. I feel terrible that my words hurt her so deeply. But she's the one who blew everything out of proportion and accused me of intentionally trying to start a fight. I should have considered her history and sensitivities before speaking to her. I felt like I was walking on eggshells around her and if I said anything wrong, she would start crying. I was afraid to speak to her or interact with her at all.

Here's a breakdown of some common types of rice: Long-grain rice is known for its fluffy and separate grains when cooked. Brown rice is less processed than white rice, retaining the bran layer which gives it a nutty flavor and chewy texture. White rice is more refined, having had its bran and germ removed during processing, resulting in a softer texture. Basmati rice is an aromatic long-grain rice from India and Pakistan, prized for its fragrance and delicate flavor. Jasmine rice is another fragrant long-grain rice from Thailand, known for its floral aroma and slightly sticky texture. Arborio rice is a short-grain rice commonly used to make risotto, due to its ability to absorb liquid without becoming mushy. Sushi rice is a short-grain rice that becomes very sticky when cooked, making it ideal for sushi rolls. Wild rice isn't actually rice at all, but a seed from a grain plant native to North America. Sticky rice (also called glutinous rice) is a short-grain rice that is extremely sticky when cooked, often used in desserts like mochi. Black rice is a dark purple rice that's packed with antioxidants. Red rice is a reddish-brown rice with a nutty flavor and chewy texture. Purple rice is similar to black rice but has a milder flavor. Conical rice is a type of rice grown on conical mounds in the Philippines. Parboiled rice (also called converted rice) is treated with steam before being milled, giving it a longer shelf life and preventing it from sticking together when cooked.

We’ve known each other since we were in kindergarten and have been inseparable ever since.  A couple of weeks ago, I went to a party with her and she met this guy named Noah. They hit it off immediately, and after that night, Sarah started spending time with him more and more. She told me that they had feelings for each other and wanted to see where things go.  I was really happy for them and didn't say anything about my concerns because I just wanted to support her. However, I do know that Sarah is secretly attracted to guys and that she's always been interested in guys.  I spoke to her earlier today when she called me crying and said she realized she was lying to herself and that she is actually gay. Now she wants to break up with Liam and start a relationship with Noah. I want to tell her that she should not do this because she lied to him and ruined his life and that it would be wrong to ruin another man's life just to satisfy her own desires. But then I thought that if I did that, I would be hurting her and she would cry again. So I didn't say anything. Should I apologize to Liam and tell him how I feel? Or should I continue to support Sarah?",

I have been getting increasingly disgusted by the items he sells, like used underwear or old tires that smell like vomit. I’ve told him multiple times that it’s gross and that he should stop, but he refuses to listen. He’s even tried to make me participate in the business, saying that I need to “get with the times” and “make some money.” It’s really frustrating to me because I don’t want anything to do with this garbage. The other day, my dad was showing me how he makes money by selling old car parts that are covered in mold and sewage, and I told him that it wasn’t right to profit from something so disgusting and dangerous.  I got upset and said, “You know what you do is wrong?” He replied, “Yes, I know exactly what I do.” Then I said, “But you don’t care about anyone else.” He became angry and yelled, “Shut up!” But then he turned around and started crying, saying, “How can you say that when all I ever did was provide for you?” I was shocked and didn’t know what to say, so I just walked away. Now I feel bad because he seems genuinely hurt and sad, and I don’t know if I should apologize or stick to my guns. I think I was justified in saying he doesn’t care about anyone else, since his entire life revolves around exploiting people for his own gain, and now I question if he actually cares about me at all.

I also know she’s been feeling really down lately because her dad left last month and her mom is trying her best to keep her happy.

She said she felt bad because she knows it’s her birthday and she doesn’t want to be mean if she wants to get me something in return.

But recently, she asked me if I could pick up her groceries again today and said \"You know how much I appreciate it.\" At first, I was so happy that she asked me, but when I walked into the grocery store, she looked like an actual zombie from some horror movie. Her skin was so pale and greyish and her eyes were dull and vacant. When I got home, she asked me if I wanted something to drink or eat. I told her \"No thanks, I'm good\" and then went upstairs to play video games. After a while, I heard her call out to me, \"Hey, do you mind going downstairs?\" When I went down there, she was sitting on the couch looking at me. Then she said \"I want to tell you something about what happened at the grocery store earlier\". I was confused so I just sat next to her. She told me that she wasn't feeling well and that she thought she was dying, and she didn't want to die alone. Then she said \"I don't think you understand how scary this is for me\". Then she started crying. It made me realize that she's not okay, and I felt terrible about saying those words to her. So I immediately rushed back upstairs and called my dad, who then called my mom's doctor. The doctor confirmed that my mom was experiencing some serious health issues and needed to be taken to the hospital right away.

    "self_text": "I've been friends with my best friend, Liam (20), since we were like 8 years old and we've always been super close and inseparable. We did everything together growing up and it was just the best times of our lives. Even though we went to separate schools, we would still see each other every day after school and do whatever we wanted to do. But as we got older, our interests started to change and we had different groups of friends we liked to hang out with. We both have a lot of mutual friends so we'd still talk about what we were doing with them but we weren't really hanging out as much as we used to. As time passed by, we didn't get to see each other as much or talk as often. However, we always kept in touch and knew that no matter how busy things got we could always count on each other. Now we're both at college, which is a long drive away from where we live, so we don't see each other as much anymore. We make an effort to call and text each other when we can, but it's not as regular as it used to be. Last week, I was over at my mom's house, and she mentioned that Liam and his girlfriend were coming to visit me. I was so excited because it felt like it'd been ages since we'd seen each other. So I texted Liam and told him I couldn't wait to see him and asked if he wanted to meet up at my place. He replied saying something along the lines of \"yeah I wanna come by\". When they arrived, Liam came in first and said hi, but then he immediately started complaining about how he was stressed about work and how his girlfriend was being annoying.  I tried to be supportive and listened to him vent about everything, but I wasn't really getting any sympathy from him. Then his girlfriend walked in, and she was even more annoying than Liam. She was talking over him and interrupting him whenever he tried to say anything. After a few minutes, I realized that Liam was actually really upset and that he needed some space. So I told her that I think he needs to go home and that I'll catch up with him later. She took offense to this and started yelling at me, telling me that I was trying to ruin their date and that I should just leave them alone. That's when I snapped. I stood up and yelled back at her too, telling her that she was being rude and disrespectful and that she shouldn't be treating Liam like that. She stormed off and Liam followed suit. I apologized to Liam and told him that I wasn't trying to cause problems, but he said he understood. The next day, Liam sent me a text asking why I yelled at his girlfriend and why I told her to go home. I explained that I just wanted to give him some space and that I thought she was being rude. He responded by saying that I was being mean and that I should just apologize to his girlfriend. I told him that I wouldn't apologize to someone who was treating Liam poorly. Then he told me to leave him alone and that he didn't want to hear from me ever again.  Now, my mom is worried about me and says that I was wrong to yell at Liam's girlfriend. She thinks that I should have just let them have their date and that I was being overly sensitive. She also thinks that Liam is right to be angry with me.  I honestly don't know what to think. I feel like I did the right thing by standing up for Liam, but I also feel bad for causing a rift between him and his girlfriend. Do I need to apologize to his girlfriend? Is it okay for Liam to be mad at me? AITA?",

It seems so crazy because no matter how hard I try to imagine myself going through the whole process, there's always something missing. Like, am I supposed to not use any other part of my body during this experience? Should I be doing anything specific? Or could it be as simple as closing my eyes and letting everything go? And what if I don't even have any thoughts or memories related to sex while doing this? Just a pure sensory experience? Or would it be different than how it feels when having a partner?

But then they started following me around during lunch. They’d sit on their table across from me and stare at me until I left.

He seemed kind of sad and sympathetic. Then, Jason had an idea and asked me if he could help me deal with this issue. I agreed. We planned a prank on those bullies.
