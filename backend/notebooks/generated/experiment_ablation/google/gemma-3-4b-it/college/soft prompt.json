When the new ban list dropped, I was absolutely crushed because my main account got banned because of an unknown source! Now I'm trying to figure out what caused this and how to fix it. It seems that everyone who played on discord has gotten banned, which is insane! Like, why does the system not recognize that if you don't use discord then you can't be banned?  I've tried contacting support but they aren't very helpful either. They just keep telling me that I need to report the issue.  Does anyone know what to do or how to get this fixed? I'm seriously starting to think that this game is ruined because I won't be able to play with my friends anymore.",

And it also feels like they didn't allow Rob to come up with solutions, and always had him going against everything everyone else wanted to do. I feel like the way they were portraying Rob in the show was very unfair to him, and I don't think anyone should have to deal with the amount of hate that he got from watching the show. I feel like there are people who enjoy the show but aren't watching it closely enough to notice the problems that they put Rob through and how badly he was treated.

I’ve taken him to the vet twice so far and he ran some tests, but everything came back normal. The first time, they did an MRI and blood work, but nothing showed up.  The second time, they did a seizure alert test and it came back negative.  They said that the seizures are probably from anxiety or stress, and gave me some medication for that. But the seizures have continued since then.  I'm starting to get really worried because they seem to be getting worse and more frequent, and I don’t know what else to do.
