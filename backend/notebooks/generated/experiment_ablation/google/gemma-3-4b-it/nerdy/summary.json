More frustratingly, I keep getting these weird Bodyslide glitches where my character gets stuck half inside walls or objects, particularly when moving through buildings. I’ve tried adjusting the Bodyslide settings (collision detection, etc.), re-installing the mods, and verifying game files, but nothing seems to fully fix it.\n\nCurrently, my base loadout includes:\n\n*   **Imperceptible Animations:** For smoother movement.\n*   **Realistic Water Two:** Because why not?\n*   **SkyUI:** Essential for inventory management.\n*   **Enhanced Werewolf Combat:** Planning on playing a werewolf ranger.\n*   **Various Texture Packs:** (Looking for recommendations if anyone has favorites!)\n\nAny advice on how to troubleshoot these specific problems?

I'm currently running:\n\n*   **Combat Evolved:** Pretty much the base package, obviously.\n*   **Mortal Enemies:** This is where I'm struggling. I've tweaked the settings significantly – reduced enemy damage, increased stagger chance, etc. – but it still feels *slow*. I’m playing a Level 83 Archmage specializing in Destruction magic.\n*   **Realistic Combat:** Using the \"Balanced\" preset as a starting point, adjusted slightly.\n*   **Immersive Citizens FPS:** Just for visual clarity.\n\nMy main issue is enemies just… plod along. They don’t react quickly enough to spells, and dodging feels clunky. I want something closer to Witcher 3 combat speeds. \n\nSpecifically, I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions for:\n\n1.  Specific Mortal Enemies tweaks beyond what's already documented? Any particular sliders worth experimenting with?\n2.  Any other mods that might complement these and improve overall responsiveness (e.g., movement speed mods, attack animations)?\n3.  Do you think these mods are inherently too slow for an Archmage build? Am I fundamentally asking the wrong question?\n\nLet me know your thoughts! Thanks in advance.",

    "self_text": "Okay, so I've been really digging into the recent speedrunning content for SV and it's got me thinking about something HUGE. What if Game Freak implemented a proper \"Nemesis System,\" like a truly reactive AI that remembers your actions and builds a persistent rival *specifically* tailored to you? Not just a generic trainer who occasionally challenges you, but someone who learns from your strategies, develops their own tactics based on how you play, and genuinely feels like a personalized threat.\n\nI know they’ve hinted at some degree of progression beyond simply leveling up, but I want a full-blown, evolving rivalry. Imagine a trainer who constantly adapts to your team composition, exploits your weaknesses, and has unique movesets designed to counter yours. They remember when you always use a specific move, and they'll punish you for it. They might even have a backstory tied to your own journey through the game – maybe they were once a student you defeated, or a rival you lost to years ago.\n\nIt would completely revolutionize the endgame experience and add layers of depth that are currently missing. Think Dark Souls boss fights, but applied to Pokemon battles.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is this a pipe dream, or could Game Freak actually pull this off?
