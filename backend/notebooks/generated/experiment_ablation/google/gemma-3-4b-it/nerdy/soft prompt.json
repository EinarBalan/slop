At first I thought it was gonna be fun getting paid to make pizzas and hanging out with friends, but I quickly realized there were some problems. The owner of the store, Tony, was a total jerk who treated everyone like they were disposable. He would yell at us for things as simple as forgetting to put oregano on a pizza or messing up a topping order. Every single time we messed up, he would call us into his office and yell at us until we cried. There was only one other employee named Sarah who didn’t get yelled at much, because she was the manager and the owner’s daughter. I tried talking to her about it, but she just shrugged and said “Just deal with him.”  I tried to ignore it, thinking it would eventually go away, but it never did. I hated working at that place. But it was all I could afford back then, so I kept showing up every day. One day, I was taking orders from a guy named Marcus. I don’t know why, but he seemed really nice. He ordered a large pepperoni pizza, extra cheese, and asked if I could add mushrooms too. So I added them and handed him the pizza. When he took a bite, he immediately spit it out and yelled, “This is disgusting! You put the wrong kind of mushrooms!”  I went running into the kitchen where Tony was yelling at Sarah, “You can’t even do your job right!”  I was crying, and Tony looked at me and said, “Well, you screwed up too.” Then he told me to quit.   I quit immediately. And now, years later, I still have nightmares about that job. I haven't been able to sleep well ever since. But something weird happened after I quit. I woke up the next morning feeling refreshed. Like I was reborn. I felt happy. I had no idea why, so I decided to go outside and see what was happening. As soon as I stepped onto the sidewalk, I saw an old man walking down the street. He looked exactly like Tony. Except…he wasn’t wearing his usual greasy apron. Instead, he was wearing a beautiful white robe and carrying a staff made of gold. He smiled at me and said, “Hello, my son.”   I froze. I couldn’t speak. He continued, “Don’t worry, I won’t hurt you. I’ve been watching you for a long time, and I know how much you suffered. You deserve peace.” Then he raised his staff and pointed it at me. A bright light flashed, and I suddenly found myself standing in a beautiful garden filled with flowers and trees. Everything smelled amazing. Birds were singing, and butterflies were fluttering around.   “Welcome,” the old man said, “to paradise.”   I looked around in amazement. This place was unlike anything I had ever seen. It was perfect.  But as I walked further into the garden, I noticed something strange. There were others there too. People who looked like they had died horrible deaths. Some were screaming, some were crying, some were just staring blankly ahead.  And they all looked... unhappy.   Then I realized what the old man had done. He hadn’t brought me to paradise. He had brought me to hell.",

This can take anywhere from 20-80 hours depending on your skill. Once that's done you can finally get your gold sword by doing a few quests for the Order of the Griffin in Velen. Overall estimate is around 130-200 hours or more.",
