We were together for a year, so there’s plenty of pictures and stuff on our profiles that we both have access to. Now that we’re broken up, I don’t think either of us want to keep any contact with the other. But anyway, I tried logging into her Facebook profile yesterday to look at some old photos, and I couldn’t get in. Today, I tried again, and I still couldn’t get in. So I assumed she had blocked me, but maybe I could get back in somehow.  So I tried logging into mine, and I noticed something weird. When I went to edit my profile, my name was changed from what it should be, to a random name and birthday that I didn't set. The picture was also changed to a random photo. I tried deleting those changes, but they kept coming back every time I tried to edit them. So I ended up leaving the page completely. Then when I came back, everything was normal again. I thought I might have been seeing something weird, and decided to leave the page completely.  I left the page completely, and then I came back later today, and everything was normal again. I’m not sure what happened, but it definitely seemed like someone else was messing around with my profile. I guess this is why I never give out my personal information online. I guess I should probably change all my passwords too.  I’m not sure what to do here. Should I report this to Facebook?  Or should I just let it go? I don’t really know.

Don’t be rude or mean; no need to be nasty about it. (No need to insult their appearance, intelligence, skills, etc.)  2. Don't ghost them! That is so disrespectful and cruel.  3. If they ask you out directly, tell them directly that you don’t want to go on a date with them. But if they continue to pursue you after that, just reiterate your point once more.  4. The most important thing is to be polite, respectful, and kind. Even when saying “no,” you should still treat them with respect. It hurts their feelings when people are rude to them. They might try to argue with you about why you shouldn’t have said “no” but stand firm. You aren’t obligated to explain yourself.  5. Be honest. (But always be nice) You can lie, but it doesn't feel good to do that and it won't work out anyway.   I really hope this helps someone!  P.S.
