A three year old chihuahua named Pepper who I thought would be easy enough for me to care for and it turns out she was not. She was super skittish and refused to come out of her crate unless someone was holding her so after about a month of getting used to me she still wasn't eating or drinking from a bowl. I took her to the vet and he said she had a heart murmur and it might get worse over time and there was nothing he could do to fix it. After about a week I found her on Craigslist for $50. The people who bought her were really nice and promised to give her all the love she needed. They brought her home and kept her in a room until she was comfortable enough to eat or drink. After a few days she started eating and drinking again and after another few weeks she was a happy healthy pup. She went through a lot of training and socialization and now she's living with her new family. My family has been planning to adopt her as their own for a while now. So I decided to take the step and bring her home as my own. And let me tell you, I wouldn't trade her for anything. We've had a long road together but she's become my best friend.  The past few months have been rough though because we've been struggling to deal with her fearfulness. She has a high drive to run away and it can be scary when she disappears. I spent hours searching the neighborhood every day just hoping to find her and I don't know what I would do if something happened to her. Then yesterday she went missing and I panicked. I searched everywhere and called her name until my voice was hoarse. Just when I was starting to lose hope I heard her bark coming from under my neighbor's porch. When I got there I saw her huddled in a corner shivering. Turns out she had gotten spooked by a car and ran off. She was okay though. I'm so relieved and grateful. I know she's going to continue to need a lot of reassurance, but seeing her safe and sound made me realize how much she means to me.

Wrye Ford does a bunch of things including fixing crashes in Skyrim and other Bethesda games (Fallout 4, Fallout 76, etc.).  It takes a bit of work to set up, but once it's working properly, it will make your game stable.  The main program itself doesn't do anything, but it relies on a separate utility program called xEdit (formerly TES5Edit).  xEdit is used to fix bugs in the game's files.  There's a lot more involved than just installing a few mods, so if you're new to modding, you might want to watch a few videos or read a guide before diving in.   Here are some resources for getting started:  * https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10198 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wL4m-d32KqU  * https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/wiki/getting_started  Let me know if you have any questions about it!",
