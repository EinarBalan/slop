    "self_text": "Hey all,  Me (27f) and my family grew up with a lot of Christmas traditions. On Christmas evening we celebrate with me, my parents and my sisters (M and S) in our own house. Christmas Day we celebrate with the entire family of my mom at my grandma's, and on Boxing day we go to my dad's parents.   This was definitely so much fun when we were younger, but when all the grandchildren grew older and got boyfriends and girlfriends the planning got more difficult because everyone would have in-laws to go to as well. But we managed. Last two years we didn't celebrate at my grandma's because of covid (we all went seperately).  In april I was unemployed and bought an Interrailticket to travel unlimited by train for one month. I wanted to go to Norway, Sweden and Denmark but suddenly I got a job, so I haven't used it yet. It is only valid for one year and this Christas break will be the only time I am able to use it.  At first I said I would go after Christmas because I know how much we love being together with the entire family again, but then... My aunt texted saying she and her children wouldn't come on Christmas days this year because of in-laws and also they didn't want to exchange presents anymore. My other aunt has always been kinda against Christmas and says she will probably go on vacation. My sister S is being an au-pair in the USA for a year so she won't be here.  That only leaves my grandma, my parents and my sister M. If I leave to Scandinavia before Christmas, I can be there 5 days longer, which is a lot in my eyes and this definitely has my preference. I don't care about celebrating Christmas on exactly these days. I would 't mind if we celebrated it a couple of days earlier. I have talked to my grandma and she's very much fine with it, she says she doesn't care as long as she gets to see us.  However my mother and my sister M are very much against it. (I don't think my dad cares a lot.) My mother texted me saying she was very disappointed and that I made it seem like I would only come if my aunts came.  I have always had a rough relationship with my mother and M and it is no surprise to me that they are on the same side, but I also feel like I just want to stand my ground. I am 27, and I can spend my Christmas however I feel like it. If they think that celebrating Christmas on exactly those days is more important than having me there, then that's",

    "self_text": "Hi everyone. We are after an app that lets us track our daughters (3 girls) periods. Are there any Apps that will let you allow to track multiple periods? Thanks 😊 Edit: Thank you for all who took their time and reply! I was not expecting that much controversy. We are not from the US, so cultural differences might play a role in that aswell. As our kids quietly share pretty much everything about their bodies and periods, it's not a privacy issue for us. They do tell us when they get their periods, sometimes it would be nice to be a step ahead though. We had two incidents in the last 5 days where one went away with Basketball. (She got asked if she needed to take supplies which she denied. A few hours and a phone call later I was on the road delivering a new set of undies and supplies. Supposedly she couldn't remember when her last period was and just was too excited to leave for Basketball in the morning to stay and take supplies. Other daughter came home crying from school yesterday because her best friend wasn't talking to her as much. And it was the end of the world. When she got her period this morning it made it a lot easier for us and her to understand why she was so emotional. (We are not here to dismiss every emotion and possible mental health issue just because they are on their period, but sometimes it gives us a perspective. ) So in short, if we as parents know that they are about to get their period we can help them navigate through it, be it managing their emotions, making a comfy weekend at home instead of going to the beach, and having all the supplies of they are going somewhere (Especially the younger one) When I was younger I used a calendar, but now using an App on my phone for my own period and was just wondering if there was something out there that would let me add my daughters aswell",

Together we have a massive driveway. The nice older couple that lived there before had a snowblower and would clear off both driveways. They didn’t do this for me because, like I said, I don’t use that driveway at all. I have a very short front walkway and the sidewalk is covered over by pine trees. So we had a large dump of snow yesterday and my neighbor shovelled their driveway. But not mine. When they got home they tried to just drive over the snow on mine. They got stuck. So they came over and told me that I needed to shovel my driveway. I said no and said I wouldn’t be using it all winter and if they wanted to drive over it they should probably clear it off themselves. They called me an irresponsible dick and said they were calling the city. As long as my trash is in the proper container at the end of my driveway the city does not care.
