    "self_text": "Okay, after weeks of waiting on parts (seriously, GPUs are still a pain!), my new PC with an RTX 3070 is FINALLY built and running beautifully. Wanted to share a few things I learned along the way for anyone else planning a build right now. \\n\\n* **PSU Wattage:** Don't skimp. I initially planned for a 650W, but read enough horror stories about transient power spikes with newer cards that I upgraded to a 750W Gold rated unit. Better safe than sorry.\\n* **Cable Management:** Take your time! Seriously. A clean case not only looks better but improves airflow. Zip ties and velcro straps are your friends.\\n* **Thermal Paste:** The pre-applied paste on my cooler was… questionable. Replaced it with Arctic MX-4 and saw a noticeable temp drop during stress tests.\\n* **BIOS Updates:** Check if your motherboard needs a BIOS update *before* installing everything. Saved me a huge headache.\\n\\nOverall, super happy with the performance. Running Cyberpunk at 1440p high settings averaging around 80-90fps. Any questions, feel free to ask!\\n",

Biggest hurdles were definitely cable management – underestimated how much space things take up behind the motherboard tray! Also, initially thought my CPU cooler wasn't seated properly because temps were high, but it turned out I forgot to remove the plastic film off the thermal paste… rookie mistake. Temps are good now though! Overall, super happy with performance in games like Cyberpunk and Elden Ring. Anyone else recently finish a build? What was your biggest struggle?
