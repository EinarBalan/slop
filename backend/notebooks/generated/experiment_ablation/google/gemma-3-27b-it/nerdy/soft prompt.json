I think there needs to be bigger penalties for teamkilling in ranked so that people don't do it anymore.

I mean, they were introduced in the last story arc as being pretty powerful, so maybe they're not just minor villains. And considering how much focus has been put on them lately, it wouldn't surprise me if they turned out to be the main antagonists.  Also, remember when we first learned about the Four, they didn't seem like they had any goals at all other than causing chaos and destruction. But now, they're starting to show more signs of having a larger plan. Maybe they're trying to build an army or take over the world or something!

The “Wanderer” DLC - This DLC would introduce a nomadic faction of people who travel around in caravans, trading goods and offering services. Players could join this faction or interact with them as traders and allies. The DLC could include new caravan routes, unique items, and quests related to the Wanderer faction.  2.   The “Coastal Kingdoms” DLC - This DLC would focus on expanding the coastal regions of the game, introducing new settlements, factions, and challenges. Players could build their own coastal cities, engage in naval warfare, and explore hidden islands and ruins. The DLC could also introduce new ship types, trade routes, and resources.  3.   The “Lost Civilizations” DLC - This DLC would delve into the history of the world, uncovering ancient civilizations and lost technologies. Players could embark on archaeological expeditions, decipher ancient texts, and uncover powerful artifacts. The DLC could introduce new questlines, dungeons, and enemies based on these lost civilizations.  4.   The “Crafting Overhaul” DLC - This DLC would revamp the crafting system, adding more depth and complexity. Players could specialize in different crafting professions, create unique items, and establish crafting guilds. The DLC could also introduce new recipes, materials, and tools.  5.   The “Political Intrigue” DLC - This DLC would expand the political aspects of the game, allowing players to engage in complex schemes, form alliances, and manipulate factions. Players could become spymasters, orchestrate coups, and influence the course of history. The DLC could introduce new characters, events, and consequences based on player choices.  These are just a few ideas, but I believe they could add a lot of value to the game. What do you think? Let me know your thoughts and suggestions!",

He's a male human who has the ability to create objects from stardust. The bigger/more complex the object, the more stamina he uses. Also, if he overuses his power, he can get very sick and tired. His main goal in life is to prove himself as a hero, but he doesn't know how to use his powers properly yet.  I was thinking that Arlo would be the son of a legendary hero who died saving the world, which could lead to him feeling like he needs to live up to his father's legacy. Or maybe he's just someone trying to find their place in the world.  What do you guys think? Any ideas or suggestions are welcome!",
