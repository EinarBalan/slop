    "self_text": "I (30F) have always found fantasy football confusing and frankly boring. My husband (32M) is *obsessed*. He spends hours researching stats, trading players, and generally stressing over his team. This year, he decided to start a league with his friends and insisted I join. He said it would be “fun” and a way for me to bond with his friends’ wives. He even drafted a team for me! I reluctantly agreed, hoping to appease him, but I haven’t checked the standings once. He keeps texting me updates and asking for my input on trades, and I’ve just been responding with vague answers like “Sounds good!” or “Whatever you think.” Yesterday, he was visibly frustrated that I hadn’t logged in to make lineup changes. He launched into a lecture about how seriously he takes the league and how unfair it is that I’m not participating. I snapped and told him I’m just not interested, I don’t understand it, and I don’t want to pretend to care. He accused me of ruining his fun and making him look bad in front of his friends. He’s now giving me the silent treatment. I feel bad for hurting his feelings, but I also feel like I shouldn’t have to participate in something I don’t enjoy just to make him happy. AITA?",

She’s very controlling and critical, and tends to make gatherings more stressful than enjoyable. This year, she's insisted on hosting Christmas Eve at her house, despite knowing I’m trying to establish boundaries. I told her I’d prefer to spend a quiet Christmas Eve with my boyfriend (27M) and our cat, but she’s reacted poorly. She’s accusing me of abandoning tradition, prioritizing my boyfriend over family, and generally making me feel guilty. She's been texting me relentlessly about how disappointed she is and how it’s “selfish” of me to not participate. My siblings (both in their 30s) are siding with my mom, saying I need to “grow up” and “make an effort.” I’ve calmly explained my reasons – needing a peaceful holiday and protecting my mental health – but they dismiss it as me being overly sensitive. I’m starting to feel really worn down and pressured. My boyfriend supports my decision wholeheartedly and thinks I should stand my ground.

I appreciate her enthusiasm, but I have a very specific aesthetic I’m going for – minimalist Scandinavian, lots of neutrals, cozy textures, etc. Her style is… maximalist grandma chic. Think bright colors, lots of figurines, tinsel everywhere. Basically, the polar opposite of what I envision. I’ve subtly tried to steer the conversation towards us handling the decorating ourselves, emphasizing that we want to establish our own traditions, but she keeps pushing. Yesterday, she outright asked if she could come over next weekend and “transform” the house. I politely but firmly said no. I explained that we appreciate her offer, but we’d like to decorate ourselves and create our own Christmas ambiance. She was visibly hurt and accused me of being ungrateful and excluding her. My boyfriend is stuck in the middle, trying to appease both of us. He says I was too harsh and should have just let her decorate a *small* corner of the house. I maintain that it’s our house, our taste, and we should have complete control over how it looks. She’s now giving him the silent treatment, and he’s sulking.

    "self_text": "I (28F) work with Sarah (32F) who is getting married in a few months. She’s always been a bit…demanding, but generally harmless. Lately, she's been constantly talking about her wedding and asking for help with various tasks. I’m happy to be supportive as a coworker, but she's started asking for increasingly elaborate assistance. First, it was brainstorming themes, then addressing envelopes, and now she wants me to *make* all 150 of her wedding favors. These aren't simple DIY projects – she wants custom-painted miniature ceramic pots with succulents planted in them. She admitted she’s terrible at crafts and “thought of me because I’m artistic.” I dabble in painting as a hobby, but this is a massive undertaking, especially considering I have a full-time job and other commitments. I politely told her I wouldn’t be able to take on such a large project, explaining that it would be too time-consuming. She got visibly upset, accusing me of being unsupportive and implying that I don’t value our friendship (we're friendly coworkers, not close friends). Other coworkers have chimed in, saying I should just suck it up and help her out. I feel like I’m being pressured to donate a significant amount of my free time to something I’m not obligated to do. AITA for setting boundaries and refusing to make her wedding favors?",
