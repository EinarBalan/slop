    "self_text": "Okay, so my (32F) sister-in-law, Sarah (28F), is…difficult. She has a *very* specific diet – gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, basically everything-free. We all know about it because she loudly proclaims it every time food is mentioned. The issue isn’t accommodating her once in a while, it’s that she consistently “forgets” to tell us when she’s coming to family events until we’re already prepping the meal. \n\nLast Thanksgiving, she showed up and was horrified there wasn’t a dedicated vegan, GF, DF, SF option. Cue the dramatic sighing and passive aggressive comments about how “thoughtless” we are. This happened AGAIN last night at my mom’s birthday. I spent hours making lasagna, and she acted genuinely shocked it had cheese. Then launched into a speech about how she feels “excluded” and like we don’t care about her health. \n\nMy husband defends her saying she has genuine sensitivities, but honestly, it feels manipulative. Like she *wants* to be the center of attention and create drama. We offered to let her bring a dish she CAN eat next time, but she said she doesn't want to \"burden\" anyone. So...we just keep getting stuck with this cycle. AITA for thinking she’s doing this on purpose and wanting to just make regular food from now on and letting her deal with it? Is there any way to navigate this without starting World War III at the next family gathering?",

Last Thanksgiving it was green bean casserole WITH crumbled bacon on top. Today she sent leftovers - mac & cheese...with ham bits. \n\nShe always acts SO shocked when we point it out. “Oh dear! How did that get in there?” followed by profuse apologies. But then it happens AGAIN next time. It’s not like she's a bad cook, she makes genuinely delicious things *without* pork. \n\nMy husband thinks she’s doing it intentionally to subtly pressure us to eat meat.

    "self_text": "Okay, long story short: my sister-in-law, Brenda, has a six-year-old, Leo, who is *severely* allergic to peanuts and tree nuts – EpiPen level stuff. Every single time we have a family dinner (and by \"we,\" I mean my husband and I usually host because our house is allergy-conscious) Brenda conveniently “forgets” to mention this until Leo starts turning red and wheezing after already eating something with nuts in it. She then acts SO surprised and makes a huge scene demanding we have an EpiPen readily available (which we do, thankfully, but it’s stressful!). This happened AGAIN last night. I snapped. I told her she was putting her son at risk intentionally for attention and that frankly, it’s incredibly rude to put that burden on us every time. Husband says I was too harsh. Am I the asshole here? Is she doing this for sympathy or…what?! Seriously considering just telling her no more Leo at our gatherings unless SHE actively manages his allergies.",

    "self_text": "Okay, long story. My (32F) sister-in-law, Brenda (35F), has a son, Leo (6M), who is *severely* allergic to peanuts and tree nuts – anaphylactic reaction level. We all know this, we’re careful, everyone understands. Every single holiday/birthday/gathering at my parents’ house (and sometimes ours), Brenda brings up, unprompted, how dangerous things are and lists everything Leo can’t have. Fine. We get it.\n\nBut then…she consistently brings food containing allergens FOR LEO. Like, last Thanksgiving she brought cookies she swore were safe, but when I checked the ingredients (because I always do now), they had walnuts. She said she “forgot” to double check. Christmas? Peanut butter fudge. Birthday party? Almond joy cake. Each time she acts shocked when someone points it out, apologizes profusely, and says she just got distracted. \n\nYesterday was a BBQ. She brought Leo a hot dog...with relish. Relish often contains mustard seed which can be cross contaminated with nuts. When I questioned it, she rolled her eyes and said “Oh come ON, I just forgot again! He loves hot dogs!” I snapped. I told her it wasn't 'forgetting', it was incredibly irresponsible and frankly, putting Leo's life at risk. I accused her of wanting sympathy instead of actually protecting her child. \n\nMy husband is furious with *me*, saying I overreacted and embarrassed her. Brenda is now giving me the silent treatment. Am I the asshole here? Is there a better way to handle this than just completely losing my patience? Seriously starting to dread any event involving Leo.",

    "self_text": "Okay, long story short. My sister-in-law, Brenda, has two kids – Leo (6) and Maya (4). Both are severely allergic to peanuts. Like, EpiPen severe. Every single family dinner we host, Brenda *forgets* to mention this until AFTER someone offers them something with peanut butter. We’ve talked about it. Repeatedly. I even made little allergy alert cards for place settings last Thanksgiving. This past weekend, she brought them over, didn’t say a word, and I offered Leo a cookie my mom made (peanut butter chocolate chip, Mom loves them!). Brenda shrieked, snatched the cookie, and then started crying about how “we always make her kids feel different.” I snapped. I told her it wasn’t our fault SHE can’t remember potentially life-threatening information about her OWN CHILDREN. Now everyone thinks *I’m* the bad guy because I upset her. Am I the asshole?

    "title": "My SIL keeps \"forgetting\" her dietary restrictions at family dinners… am I the AH for calling her out?",
    "self_text": "Okay, so my SIL (Sarah) is vegan – has been for like 5 years. Every single family dinner hosted by my MIL (her mother-in-law, who *loves* cooking elaborate meals) Sarah conveniently \"remembers\" she’s vegan *after* already eating half of something with cheese/meat/eggs in it. Like, she’ll pile her plate high, then ask “Oh! Is there dairy in this?” after several bites. This happened AGAIN last night. I finally said, politely but firmly, “Sarah, honestly, it feels like you do this on purpose. Just check before you eat.” She burst into tears and accused me of ruining Christmas. Everyone else awkwardly shuffled their feet. My husband says I should just let it go because she gets sensitive. But seriously, isn't this incredibly rude and passive aggressive? AITA for pointing it out?",

    "title": "My MIL keeps \"forgetting\" she offered to pay for something - am I the jerk for calling her out?",
    "self_text": "Okay, so backstory: my husband and I are planning our wedding next year. His mother *insisted* on paying for the flowers, which we were totally fine with (they’re expensive!). She specifically said “Consider it my gift to you both.” Great! We picked out a florist, got a quote…and now she’s acting like she never offered. Like, full-on denial. When we sent her the invoice, she replied with “Oh dear, that’s a lot of money!” and then started talking about how WE need to budget responsibly. This has happened twice now – once with the flowers and again with the rehearsal dinner venue. Each time she initially volunteers, then acts shocked when we follow through. Is this some kind of passive aggressive power play? Am I being unreasonable to point out she literally volunteered to cover these costs? Husband says I should just let it go because “Mom gets confused sometimes” but it feels manipulative. AITA for wanting her to honor her initial offers?",

    "title": "My MIL keeps \"forgetting\" we don't eat pork. Is this malicious or just…dense?",
    "self_text": "Okay, so my husband (32M) and I (30F) are both pretty firm non-pork eaters for religious reasons. We’ve told his mother (65F) *multiple* times. Like, every time she asks what we want for dinner when visiting, we politely say “anything but pork!” She always says “Oh right, of course!” Then...she makes something with bacon. Or ham. Or serves sausage at breakfast. This has happened at least five times now. \n\nThe first couple of times, we just quietly picked around it. Didn’t want to cause a scene. But last Christmas she made a full roast pork loin and acted genuinely surprised when we didn’t touch it. Said, “Oh dear, did I forget again?” Now she’s doing it AGAIN – planning a brunch and asked if there were any dietary restrictions. I reiterated NO PORK. And I *just* got a text saying she's making sausage gravy biscuits. \n\nMy husband thinks she’s just getting old and legitimately forgetting. He gets annoyed when I suggest it might be passive aggressive because she loves to guilt trip us about not spending enough time with her. I honestly think she knows exactly what she’s doing. It feels like a deliberate test of our boundaries. AITA for thinking she’s intentionally ignoring our requests? And how do I handle this without starting World War III at brunch?",

    "title": "My SIL keeps \"forgetting\" her dietary restrictions at family events - am I the jerk for subtly adjusting portions?",
    "self_text": "Okay, long story short, my sister-in-law, Brenda, has a LOT of dietary restrictions. Gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, basically lives on air and sadness. Every single family gathering – and we do them *often* because my mom loves hosting – she announces these restrictions RIGHT as everyone is serving themselves. Like, after Mom spent all day making lasagna. Or cookies. And then gets visibly upset when there's nothing immediately available for her. She always frames it like an honest mistake (\"Oh shoot, I forgot to mention...\") but it feels incredibly performative. \n\nI started quietly taking smaller portions for her, knowing she’ll complain and then I can offer her the salad or whatever safe option we have. It avoids a whole scene with my mom getting flustered and Brenda dramatically sighing. But my brother says I'm being passive aggressive and should just let Brenda deal with it herself. He thinks I'm trying to control the situation. \n\nAm I the jerk here? Is letting her make a fuss every time better than subtly managing things to avoid drama? Honestly, it’s exhausting.",

This weekend at a BBQ, same thing happened with a marinade. I snapped. I told her, very bluntly, that she needs to be responsible for her son and stop putting everyone else in an awkward and potentially dangerous position. She burst into tears saying I was attacking her as a mother. Now the whole family thinks *I'm* the villain. Am I the asshole here? Honestly, I feel like enabling this is worse than being rude.",
