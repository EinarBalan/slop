    "self_text": "So I (18F) have been in therapy since I was 13 and I’m really working on establishing boundaries with my family, especially my mom (40F). She has always tried to control everything about me - what I wear, who I hang out with, what I study etc.  I just started college and I want to move out as soon as possible but my mom says that I won’t be able to afford it.   My dad is really supportive of me moving out though, he wants me to experience life outside the house. He’s also pretty good at managing money so I’ve asked him if I can talk to him about finances and he agreed.  When my mom found out that I spoke to my dad, she got mad and accused me of going behind her back and said that I’m trying to drive a wedge between them. I told her that I wasn’t doing either of those things, I simply wanted help from someone who isn’t controlling. She then went off on a rant saying how much she does for me and how ungrateful I am. After she calmed down, I told her that she doesn’t do anything *for* me, she does everything *to* me and that she’s actually not a very good mother.   She burst into tears and said that I’m hurting her feelings. She kept repeating “How could you say something like that to your mother?” I told her that I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings but that she needs to take accountability for her actions.  I feel really bad now because I don’t think I should have called her a bad mother. But I still stand by everything else I said.   AITA?",

I told her it wasn’t a big deal and that I could do it myself, but she insisted on helping anyway. We were both struggling with the bag, and she started yelling at me again. She said that I was making fun of her because I knew she couldn’t lift anything.  I tried to explain to her that I wasn’t trying to make fun of her, but she wouldn’t listen. She just kept yelling at me until I finally gave up and carried the bag myself.  The next day, she called me and apologized for yelling at me. She said that she was just having a bad day and that she didn’t mean to be so rude. I accepted her apology and we moved on. But then yesterday, she did it again.

She's always had bad luck with guys, she dates them, they leave her after like a month, she gets heartbroken, then repeats it over and over again. She went on a first date with him last year, and he didn’t call her back. Then six months later she got a text from him out of nowhere asking if she wanted to go on another date. Of course she did, since she hasn’t gone on a date in months. So they started seeing each other. When she told me about him, I was very concerned because he had ghosted her once already.  I tried to tell her that maybe she should reconsider him but she said she liked him. Fine, whatever. She doesn’t listen to me anyway. Anyway, things were going well between them until she told me about what happened last weekend. They went to dinner at his place, where he lives alone, and while they were eating, he took pictures of her without her knowing. He showed them to her after they finished eating and asked if she liked them. She didn’t say anything, just looked at him and said “no”. He apologized and deleted them.   He also texted her multiple times during work hours asking if she would come home early so he could see her. She told him no every time, but he kept texting her. This isn’t even getting into how much he talks about himself and how little he asks about her. I told her he was a creep and that she needs to break up with him immediately before he does something worse. She said I was being dramatic and that she likes him and wants to give him a chance.

We both grew up in a small town with very little going on so whenever there was an event or something we wanted to do that wasn’t available locally we would drive about 2 hours away.  We’ve done this our entire lives without any issues.   I just got a new job last week after being unemployed for 8 months. The job pays alright but it isn’t great.   So Dave calls me yesterday saying he wants to go see a concert about 3-4 weeks from now and asks if I want to come along. I say sure because I love music and haven’t had anything planned for awhile anyway. So then he says the tickets are $150 each plus gas money which will be around $100 each.   I immediately said no. He kept pushing though. Saying how much fun we always have together and that he really wants me to come. Eventually I caved. I told him I can pay $150 for the ticket but no more than that. He agreed.   He texted me today asking if I could pay him $400.   I asked what for and he said the hotel room. I told him I thought we weren’t staying at a hotel. He said he never mentioned anything about us not staying at a hotel.   When I pressed him on why he didn’t mention anything about the hotel when he first asked me if I wanted to go he said he forgot. Then he said he only asked if I wanted to go to get out of doing things with his girlfriend.   I told him I don’t appreciate him using me as an excuse to get out of spending time with his girlfriend and I definitely don’t think it’s fair for him to expect me to pay $400 for a hotel room I didn’t even know about. And I definitely don’t need to spend $400 on a hotel when I just started a new job.   Then he started getting mad at me calling me cheap and inconsiderate.   I told him I’m not cheap but I am broke. I also told him I’m sorry if he feels like I’m being inconsiderate but I feel like he’s being inconsiderate by springing this on me last minute.

We were both devastated, and things were really tense between us after that, but we started to talk again and try to be friends. A few days ago, he texted me and asked if we could meet up.  I agreed, so we met up for coffee and talked about everything that happened. He apologized for cheating on me, and I told him I accepted his apology. We both said we wanted to stay friends, and then he said something that really pissed me off.  He said I was the worst girlfriend he’d ever had. I don’t know why he would say that. He knows how much it hurt me when he cheated on me, and now he’s trying to make me feel bad by saying I was a terrible girlfriend? It just doesn’t seem fair.   We got into a huge argument after that, and I left before we could resolve anything. Now he’s not talking to me, and I don’t know what to do. Should I reach out to him and apologize for getting angry, or should I just let him come to me?  Edit: Thanks for the advice everyone! I think I need to take some time to myself and figure out what I want from our friendship before I can move forward. I also think I need to stop trying to please him and start focusing on myself.

A man has been sent by another mafia family to kill Michael while he is at the church. As Michael stands at the alter saying his vows, people are being murdered by his men at other locations. This includes the man who was sent to murder him.   This sounds like it could come from the movie \"Goodfellas\". In Goodfellas Henry Hill makes an announcement over the intercom system of his restaurant as a way to get rid of someone who isn't paying protection money to the mob. He does so on the same day that they have some sort of ceremony or party going on. Henry announces that anyone with a red shirt should leave because the restaurant is about to be raided. It's very dark humor but also incredibly effective.  It's possible you may be referring to a clip from the film \"Casino\" starring Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. In Casino Ace Rothstein hires two brothers Sam \"Ace\" and Nick to run the Tangiers casino for him. During the film, the brothers begin stealing money from the casino without Ace's permission. Eventually Ace confronts them and they attempt to kill him. After failing to kill him they try to steal all the money from the casino and flee the country.

She is very opinionated and doesn’t like when things aren’t done a certain way.  I moved out when I was 18 and went away for college, but after graduation I ended up moving back home. This was due to financial reasons as well as not having any other options available to me, so I had no choice but to move in with my parents. I started looking for another place, but rent prices are insane where I live.   So I began dating this guy (26M) who I really liked and we were talking about moving in together, but he lived pretty far away from me and would need to get a new job if he moved here. He also wasn’t making much money because of his current job. We decided to wait until he got a better job and then decide if it made sense to move in together.   A week later my mom starts asking me if I wanted to start looking at places again because she thinks “it’s time” and that I should be living alone. She says that I am too old to still be living with my parents and I need to get out there and find myself. But I told her that I don’t want to move out right now, because I just got settled in and I didn’t want to deal with all of the stress that comes with finding an apartment. I also explained to her that I am seeing someone and we might be moving in together eventually, but that he needs to get a better job first before we can even think about doing that.   She then says that I am letting this guy make decisions for me and that I need to do what *I* want. She keeps repeating how I shouldn’t let him dictate my life. When I try to explain that we haven’t actually discussed moving in together yet, she dismisses me and continues to say that I’m being controlled by him. I told her that I am not being controlled by anyone and that I am capable of making my own decisions. I said that I thought she understood that I was seeing someone and that I was happy, but instead she tries to guilt trip me into breaking up with him.   When I ask why she is suddenly concerned about my happiness and wellbeing, she says that she is worried about me and that I will end up regretting everything if I stay with him. Then she goes on to list all of the flaws he has, most of which are things that I already know and don’t care about. I asked her why she is suddenly interested in pointing out his flaws, since she never did before. She says that she wants me to be happy and that she is only looking out for my best interests. I pointed out that she is doing the opposite of looking out for my best interests, and that she is actually trying to sabotage my relationship.   Then she gets angry and accuses me of being ungrateful and disrespectful. She tells me that she has sacrificed everything for me and that I should appreciate everything she does for me. I tell her that I do appreciate everything she does for me, but that I don’t appreciate her trying to manipulate me and control my life. She then storms off and refuses to speak to me for the rest of the day.   Now I feel bad, because I may have hurt her feelings.

She's also very generous and likes to treat me.  A few weeks ago we went on a date night where we got dinner at an expensive steakhouse. The bill came out to around $200, which was way more than either of us had planned to spend. I offered to pay half, but she insisted on paying the whole thing since it was our anniversary (which it wasn't).  I thanked her for being so nice, but told her that if she wanted to split things, I would be happy to give her half. She said she didn't want anything from me, but I still gave her $100 anyway because I felt bad.  She didn't say anything when I gave her the money, but she hasn't mentioned it since. I haven't asked her about it either, but I figured she just forgot about it.  Today, she asked me if I could take her shopping tomorrow. I told her that I couldn't because I was busy with work. She seemed upset and told me that she really needed new clothes for a party next week. I apologized again and told her that maybe we could go another time.  She then brought up the $100 that I gave her a few weeks ago. She said that she thought I was trying to buy her love or something. I told her that I wasn't trying to do that, and that I just wanted to contribute to the cost of dinner. She then accused me of being cheap and selfish.  I tried to explain to her that I don't make as much money as she does, and that I can't always afford to pay for everything. But she wouldn't listen. She kept telling me that I should be grateful that she even goes out with me.   I'm starting to think that she might be right. Maybe I am cheap and selfish. But I don't know what else to do. I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells around her.  AITA for asking my girlfriend to pay me back $100?",

I don’t think it’s an STI because I got tested about two months ago after having unprotected sex with someone who turned out to have chlamydia, but everything came back negative.

    "self_text": "My aunt is a very sweet and nice person, but she’s also extremely entitled. She always expects me to do things for her whenever she asks, even if I have other plans or am busy. For example, last week she asked me to go shopping with her because she wanted someone to help carry the bags, despite knowing that I had plans with my friends. When I told her I couldn’t go, she got angry at me and said I was being rude.  She also expects me to pay for her when we go out to eat, which I don’t mind doing sometimes, but it’s become an expectation.   I didn’t say anything about it for a long time, but yesterday I finally snapped after she asked me to drive her to the airport at 4am on Saturday morning. I told her I couldn’t do it because I was going away with my boyfriend for the weekend. She got really mad and accused me of not caring about her.  After she left, I called her and apologized for snapping at her, but I also told her that I think she needs to stop expecting so much from me. She hung up on me and hasn’t spoken to me since.  Am I the asshole for telling her she has a problem with being entitled?",

She works as an escort/adult film actress and I just don’t want her to take advantage of him.  I feel like he's being groomed by her. He always tells me how happy she makes him, and he says that she treats him well. But what if she wants something from him? She knows he’s young and naive, and she might use that against him.  I haven’t told anyone about this because I don’t want them to tell him to break up with her, or make things worse in any way. I also don’t want her to find out I said anything bad about her. It would ruin our relationship forever. I feel like I’m stuck in a nightmare. What do I do?!",

    "self_text": "So I have a friend that’s been getting on my nerves lately, and it all came to a head when we were at the bar last night. He got into a fight with a guy who was trying to talk to our other friend (who’s dating someone else), so he started yelling and swearing at him. He ended up pushing the guy around and had to be held back by everyone in the bar.  I told him that what he did was wrong, and he started saying that “he deserved it” because he was trying to get with his friend’s girlfriend. I tried explaining that even if that was true, violence isn’t the answer, but he just kept arguing with me.  He then said that he has a right to defend himself, and I asked him if he thought that shoving some random guy was defending himself. He went on about how he wasn’t going to let anyone disrespect him or his friends, and I told him that no one was disrespecting anyone. The guy was just talking to our friend.  Then he turned around and said that I need to shut up, and that I don’t know anything about friendship. I told him that I do know about friendship, and that real friends don’t act like that. Then he called me a bitch and stormed off.   Now he’s mad at me for calling him out, and I feel bad for hurting his feelings, but I also think he needs to understand that his behavior is unacceptable.

He got mad at me saying that I can’t just refuse to help someone out like that when they need it and that I should’ve just been late for work. I told him again that I couldn’t as I needed to get to work on time and that he should’ve thought about it before making plans that depended on other people.
