    "self_text": "so me (30m) and my gf (29f) have been dating for about 8 months now, we’ve known each other since high school but never talked until last year. it started off pretty slow, mostly texting and hanging out occasionally with our friend groups together, then we started going on dates and things escalated from there. shes really sweet and caring, and loves animals which is something i really admire, she has two cats that are very affectionate and love cuddles. she works as an assistant teacher at the local elementary school and is super good at her job, all of the kids adore her and she gets along great with the staff and parents. ive always had a thing for teachers, so thats definitely a plus lol. shes also very smart and intelligent, even though she didnt go to college, she taught herself how to code and currently freelances doing web development stuff while looking for a full time job. tbh shes basically everything i ever wanted in a girl, so why am i feeling this way? well here's where things get tricky...  i have a history of cheating in previous relationships, and its something i really struggle with. im not proud of it, and im ashamed of what i did, but im still trying to work through it and be better. i think part of it comes from being insecure and wanting validation from others, but i know that doesnt excuse my actions. when i met my gf, i was determined to be faithful and honest, and i truly want to make this relationship work. i tried to cut off contact with any girls who were giving me attention, and i made sure to tell my gf if anyone flirted with me or made me uncomfortable. she was understanding and supportive, and she helped me navigate those situations without getting into trouble. however, recently things have changed. we went on vacation together a couple weeks ago, and it was amazing! we spent hours just talking and laughing, and we got closer than ever before. but when we came home, i started to feel restless again. i found myself checking social media more often, and i even started flirting with some girls online. i felt guilty immediately after doing it, and i stopped myself before anything could happen, but the fact that i even considered it is eating away at me.   i told my gf about it yesterday, and she was understandably upset. she said she needed space to process everything, and i completely respect that. i hate hurting her, and i dont want to lose her, but i feel like im constantly fighting against my own demons.  im starting therapy next week, and im hoping it will help me understand why i do these things and how to stop them. but right now, im just feeling lost and confused. im scared that ill end up ruining another relationship, and im tired of being this person. im really struggling to stay positive and hopeful, and im wondering if maybe im just not capable of being in a healthy, monogamous relationship. does anyone else struggle with this? how do you cope?  tl;dr: im a serial cheater trying to change, and im scared im gonna ruin another relationship.  edit: thanks for the support everyone, im glad im not alone in this. i appreciate the advice and encouragement, and ill definitely take it to heart. im committed to working on myself, and hopefully i can become the partner my gf deserves.",

    "self_text": "My (26F) daughter (5F) is very smart and perceptive, but also a little bit spoiled and demanding. She’s been asking for a new phone for about a year now, even though her current one is still working just fine. She knows that I don’t want to buy her a new phone right now because we are saving up for other things, like furniture and home repairs. She has also asked me to go to Disney World, which is something I can’t afford right now either.   I understand that it’s hard for a child to hear “no,” especially when they really want something. But I think it’s important for her to learn that she can’t always get what she wants, and that sometimes she needs to accept the fact that things aren’t going to go her way.   So how do I tell her that she’s wrong without making her feel bad or hurt? Should I try to explain the financial situation in more detail, or should I just stick to saying “no”?",

She thinks that because I have tried something once, I should like it forever, which is really annoying.   I am currently living with my parents and two siblings. They are both very athletic and seem to live at the gym.  My mom makes sure we all get enough protein every day, so our meals usually consist of meat and vegetables.   Recently, my mother made chicken breast and broccoli for dinner. I wasn’t in the mood for either, so I asked her if I could just have some rice instead. She said no, saying that I need to eat my protein.   So, I ate the chicken and broccoli and pretended to enjoy it, though I really didn’t.   After dinner, my brother started complaining about how much he hates chicken and broccoli. My sister chimed in too.   I was annoyed because they were complaining about the same thing that I had just endured. So, I told them that I also hated chicken and broccoli.   They got upset with me and accused me of being rude.  They said that I shouldn’t complain about their dinners when I don’t eat what my mother makes me.   I explained that I only ate it because my mother told me I had to, but they wouldn’t listen.   Now they are giving me the silent treatment and ignoring me whenever I talk to them.   AITA?",

My parents are divorced, with me living with my mom since the divorce when I was in middle school. My dad lives out of state but I see him every once in a while when he comes into town or vice versa. He remarried about five years ago and has two sons from his marriage that are currently still living at home.  I am close with my mom and brothers, but it's just never really worked out between me and my step-brothers. They were a lot older than me and always seemed to resent my existence because they felt like their dad didn't care about them as much after meeting me. The feelings haven't gotten any better over time.  As for my dad, he is an amazing man who loves me very much. However, he does have some issues with controlling people, especially my mother. He doesn't seem to realize how bad his behavior can be and will often make decisions without consulting anyone else. It got so bad that my mom filed for divorce because she couldn't stand being controlled by him any longer.  When my boyfriend started coming around my house more often, he quickly became friends with my step-brothers and started hanging out with them whenever he came over. This wouldn't bother me if they weren't such awful people, but they tend to pick on me all the time. Whenever my boyfriend would come over, they would start making fun of me for things like having acne or wearing certain clothes. I tried to brush it off at first, but it eventually started getting to me.  Then there's my dad. When my boyfriend would come over, my dad would constantly try to \"one up\" him. He'd talk about his accomplishments at work, brag about how much money he makes, and generally try to make my boyfriend feel inferior. I noticed that my boyfriend would get visibly uncomfortable whenever my dad did this, but he never said anything.  I've talked to both my step-brothers and my dad about their behavior, but they don't seem to understand why it bothers me. They say I'm too sensitive and need to learn to take a joke. My dad says he's just trying to be friendly and wants to get to know my boyfriend better.  I'm starting to dread having my boyfriend come over to my house. I love him very much, but I don't want him to have to deal with my dysfunctional family. I think it would be best if he stopped visiting my house altogether. Am I the asshole for wanting this?",

We broke up about 3 months ago and haven’t really talked much since then (mostly because he ghosted me a bit). He has recently started responding to my texts again, but it hasn’t been anything meaningful (just like “how are you?” or “what have you been doing lately?”), so I figured there was no harm in telling him that I missed him.  Apparently, there was. I guess he didn’t want to hear that from me?   It feels pretty bad to be blocked by someone who used to mean so much to me, especially when I was just trying to be honest with him about how I felt. It makes me wonder if maybe I should have just kept quiet and pretended that I didn’t care anymore. But honestly, I don’t think I could have done that. I wanted him to know that I still had feelings for him, even though I knew that things were probably never going to work out between us.  I wish he would have just told me if he wasn’t interested instead of blocking me without saying anything. It just seems like such a cowardly thing to do.  But whatever, I guess. If he doesn’t want to talk to me, then fine. I can live with that. I just hope that someday he will realize that he made a mistake and come back to me.

I looked around the room, but didn't see anything. The only light in the room came from the streetlights outside, so it was pretty dark. I tried to go back to sleep, but I kept hearing the whispering. It started to get louder and more insistent, and I started to feel really scared.  I finally got out of bed and went to find my mom. When I told her what was happening, she said that it was probably just my imagination running wild. But I knew that it wasn't my imagination. I could feel something in the room with me, and it was making me feel really uneasy.  My mom stayed with me for a while, but eventually she left me alone again. As soon as she left, the whispering started again. This time, it was accompanied by a cold breeze. I could feel it on my skin, and it made me shiver.  I started to cry, and I huddled under the covers. I prayed that whatever was in the room would leave me alone. After a few minutes, the whispering stopped and the cold breeze disappeared. I finally fell asleep, but I didn't sleep very well that night.  The next day, I asked my mom if we could move. She said that we couldn't afford to move, so I had to learn to live with it. And I did.

My sister has been working as a secretary at the hospital for over 20 years now and she is very well off financially. She makes around $5,000 per month and her husband works too so they have a lot of money coming in. \\n\\nI've always tried to be there for my sister but lately she's been really difficult to deal with. She doesn't understand that I need help with money and she just keeps telling me that I need to work harder.  She even told me once that if I was more careful with my spending then I wouldn't be poor! This made me feel like garbage. It's hard enough being a single mom with two kids who are sick all the time without having someone judge you for trying to make ends meet. \\n\\nMy sister asked me to watch her dogs while she went on vacation last year and I agreed because I love animals. But when I got there, it turned out that she had 4 dogs! The place was filthy and covered in dog hair. And she didn't leave me any food or supplies for the dogs. I ended up having to go buy everything myself.   When she returned from vacation, she didn't offer to reimburse me for anything. I asked her about it and she said \"Oh yeah, I totally forgot.\" I reminded her that she promised to pay me back for the food and supplies and she got really angry. She started yelling at me saying that I should have known better than to expect her to pay me back. She said that she did me a favor by letting me watch her dogs and that I shouldn't be asking her for money. \\n\\nI'm starting to think that my sister is just a terrible person. She doesn't care about anyone except herself and she only wants to use people.  I don't want to have anything to do with her anymore. But I still feel guilty for wanting her to pay me back.

After months of being isolated from everyone I knew, I finally realized just how toxic he was and broke up with him. But now I’m wondering if I’m crazy or something - because he suddenly got bored of me once I became completely dependent on him.

I am currently working on changing my narcissistic traits. It has been difficult. Here are some things I've learned about myself and other narcissists:   1. Narcissism is an inherent part of your personality. You can't just change that trait overnight. It takes years of therapy and self-reflection to overcome it.   2. Narcissists do not like criticism. They will lash out if you try to criticize them.   3. Narcissists need validation. They need to be told how great they are.  4. Narcissists often use others for their own gain. They will take advantage of others without thinking twice.   5. Narcissists are very insecure. They hide their insecurity by putting others down.  6. Narcissists think they are better than everyone else. They believe they are special and deserve more than everyone else.   7. Narcissists are manipulative. They will manipulate others to get what they want.  8. Narcissists have difficulty empathizing with others. They don't understand how others feel.   9. Narcissists are always right. They never admit when they are wrong.  10. Narcissists love attention. They crave attention and will do anything to get it.   If you are dealing with a narcissist, it is important to set boundaries. Do not let them control you. Do not give them validation. And most importantly, protect yourself.

I would drink every night after work to relax, and then on the weekends I would go out with friends and get drunk. I didn't think it was a big deal at first, but over time I realized that I was starting to rely on alcohol to cope with stress and anxiety.  I tried to cut back on my drinking several times, but I always ended up relapsing. I would tell myself that I could control it, but I couldn't. The more I drank, the more I wanted to drink.  A few months ago, I finally hit rock bottom. I got into a fight with my wife and I woke up the next morning with no memory of what had happened. I knew that I needed help, so I went to see a therapist.  My therapist told me that I have a drinking problem and that I need to get treatment. I agreed to go to rehab, and I'm currently in week three of my program.  It's been really hard, but I'm starting to feel better. I'm learning how to cope with stress and anxiety without turning to alcohol. I'm also rebuilding my relationship with my wife.  But I still have a long way to go.

It feels like I can't just enjoy having male friends without my brain trying to turn it into something romantic. It makes things awkward and strained, and I end up withdrawing from friendships rather than dealing with the emotional fallout.  I know I should probably be focusing on myself and working on not seeking validation from others, but it's easier said than done. Any advice on how to break this pattern?

I said that if he doesn't start making an effort to get his life together, I'm going to ask him to move out.  He got really angry and started yelling at me, saying that I had no right to tell him what to do. He stormed out of the room and hasn't spoken to me since.

I used to take Sam to a local pool every week as part of a volunteer program for autistic children, where I would help him get changed, help him in the water, and then help him change again after the session. After Covid hit, the sessions got cancelled, so I stopped going with Sam. We still hang out, though.   A few weeks ago, Sam was telling me about wanting to go to a water park nearby that had a lot of slides, but he said Jen hadn’t taken him because she didn’t want to deal with all the chaos of crowds and noise. He said she also wasn’t sure how she could handle helping him get changed while dealing with crowds.  I asked her if I could take him myself, which she agreed to. I told her I wanted to take him on a day when it wouldn’t be too busy, so she suggested next Wednesday morning, before schools got out. So, I took Sam to the water park last Wednesday. It wasn’t super crowded and he really enjoyed himself. I helped him get changed and made sure he had sunscreen on, and we went on some slides together.   When I dropped Sam off back home, Jen thanked me for taking him and said he had a great time. She mentioned that she felt bad for not being able to take him herself, but she was glad he got to go.

She responded by saying that I was being unhelpful and that I always make excuses whenever she asks for help.  She said that I only offer to do things when they benefit me, like taking Sam to the water park because I enjoy spending time with him. I was shocked. I had spent hours with Sam, making sure he had fun and staying safe, and now she was accusing me of doing it for selfish reasons? I tried to explain that I genuinely wanted to take Sam and that I didn’t mind helping him, but she wouldn’t listen. She kept interrupting me and insisting that I was being inconsiderate.   I ended the conversation abruptly and left. Now I feel guilty about what happened, even though I don’t think I did anything wrong.
