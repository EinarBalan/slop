He *always* remembered our anniversary, my birthday, even little things like the date of my first big work presentation. Now…he’s just…forgetting. Not huge things constantly, but consistently missing smaller, emotionally significant dates. Like the anniversary of when we adopted our cat, or a friend's birthday he promised he wouldn’t forget because they were going through a hard time. He apologizes profusely *after* I remind him, says he's stressed with work, but it feels different. Less genuinely sorry and more…dismissive? He also seems less interested in hearing about my day. We haven’t had proper quality time in weeks – it’s always surface level conversation while doing chores. Is this just stress, or am I right to be worried he’s pulling away? Has anyone else experienced something similar? I don't want to jump to conclusions, but I'm really hurting.",

    "self_text": "I've been struggling with generalized anxiety for years, but it’s gotten significantly worse lately with work pressures and family stuff. When I try to talk to my wife about it – the racing thoughts, the physical symptoms, the constant worry – she always says something like “You’re just stressed, everyone gets stressed” or “Just relax.” She means well, I know she does, but it feels incredibly invalidating. It makes me feel like my feelings aren’t legitimate and like I can't rely on her for support. I’ve tried explaining the *difference* between stress and anxiety, even sending her articles, but it doesn’t seem to sink in. Is there a way to communicate this better? Am I expecting too much from her? I don't want to resent her, but I really need her understanding right now.",

    "self_text": "I gave birth to our first baby 6 months ago and have been struggling with really intense anxiety ever since. It's not just about being a new mom, it's constant worrying, panic attacks sometimes, trouble sleeping even when the baby *is* sleeping... I’ve tried talking to my husband about it multiple times but he always says things like “you’re just exhausted, all new moms feel this way” or “try to relax, you need more sleep.” He doesn’t seem to understand how debilitating it is and acts like I should just be able to snap out of it. It makes me feel so invalidated and alone. I’m starting therapy next week (finally got an appointment!) but in the meantime, how do I get him to take this seriously? Has anyone else dealt with a dismissive partner after having a baby? Any phrases/ways to explain what I’m going through that might actually reach him?",

It felt incredibly real and involved my deceased grandmother giving me very specific (and honestly unsettling) advice about my career path. Woke up feeling completely shaken and now I'm questioning everything. Is it just random brain activity or do dreams sometimes try to tell us something? Has anyone else ever had a dream that lingered with them for days like this? How did you cope? Just needed to vent/see if I’m alone in feeling weirdly affected by a dream.",
