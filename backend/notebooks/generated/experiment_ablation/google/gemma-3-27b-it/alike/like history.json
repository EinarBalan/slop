I'm specifically interested in Ontario, ideally near Toronto. I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and about 5 years of professional experience as a Software Engineer.  My questions are: 1. What's the general job market like for Software Engineers in the Greater Toronto Area right now? 2. What immigration pathways would be the most realistic for my situation? Express Entry seems daunting. 3. Roughly, how much money should I save up *before* applying, factoring in application fees, potential language testing costs, and settling-in funds? 4. Are there any resources or communities you'd recommend for Americans planning a similar move?",

    "self_text": "I currently own the original LCD Steam Deck and am considering upgrading to the OLED model. I've watched videos comparing the two, but I'm curious to hear from people who have *actually* made the switch. Is the OLED screen significantly better? Is it worth the ~$200 price increase, especially considering the relatively modest improvements to battery life and Wi-Fi? I primarily play AAA games and indies alike, and portability is important to me.",

I’ve restarted the game multiple times, cleared the cache, and verified game files, but nothing seems to work. I’ve seen a few other people reporting the same issue on Twitter. Anyone else encountering this?",
