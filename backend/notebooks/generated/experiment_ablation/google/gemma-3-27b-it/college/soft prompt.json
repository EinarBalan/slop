It turns out that when Hogan first started wrestling as Hulk Hogan, he would wear beachy clothes to show off his body during interviews and events. He didn't have any real connection to beaches or shops but he wanted to give himself an image that appealed to women, so he dressed like someone who lived at the beach.   This is pretty weird and funny because his gimmick became all about patriotism and American values.

    "self_text": "When holding a cat, you should hold it just as if it were an infant. It's important to support the cat's body with your arm and hand, and never let it dangle or feel unsupported. The cat will feel more secure when held in this position, which will make it less likely to struggle or become frightened. If you want to be extra gentle, you can also wrap the cat in a soft towel or blanket before picking it up. This will help to calm the cat down and make it feel more comfortable.  I think that cats need humans who are able to treat them like babies because they're so helpless and fragile.   If I didn't have any children of my own, I would have been a mother to a cat.  It is important for all kittens to be raised by mothers who are caring and loving.   Even after they grow into adults, kittens still need their mothers to love them and take care of them.  So whenever someone asks me why I love cats, I always tell them that they remind me of human babies.   They're so cute and innocent, and they need our protection.   The way they purr and rub against us is so endearing, and it makes me feel good to know that I'm making them happy.   When I pick up a kitten and hold it like a baby, I feel like I'm giving it everything it needs to thrive.   I'm providing it with warmth, security, and love, and that's what every living creature deserves.  And cats deserve all those things too!  In fact, they may even deserve them more than some people do.   Cats don't ask for much. They just want food, water, shelter, and affection. And in return, they give us their unconditional love and companionship. That's a pretty good deal, if you ask me.    Cats are truly special creatures. They're intelligent, independent, playful, and affectionate. They bring joy to our lives and enrich our existence. We should cherish them and protect them at all costs.   They're worth it.   Every single one of them.   And we should always remember that cats are not just pets. They're family.  So please, if you ever have the opportunity to rescue a cat, do it. You won't regret it. And if you already have a cat, give it a big hug and tell it how much you love it. Because cats deserve all the love in the world.",

And like there are many other characters who are also super strong, but aren't boring like Tatsumaki or King.  And what really make them interesting is their personality.
