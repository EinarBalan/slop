    "self_text": "I (23F) am a student currently living in an apartment with my boyfriend (24M). My little brother, David (18M), is away at college but came home after testing positive for COVID. He’s been staying here for about a week now, and while he’s being careful to isolate from us as much as possible, it’s still stressful having someone sick in the house. I made him agree to stay in the spare bedroom, wear a mask whenever he leaves his room, and disinfect everything he touches. My boyfriend is immunocompromised due to a medical condition, so I’m really worried about him getting sick. \n\nI told my mom that David was staying here and she got mad at me, saying I should have insisted he quarantine at his friend's place or something instead of putting my boyfriend at risk. She thinks I’m prioritizing David over my boyfriend, and even accused me of not caring about my boyfriend’s health. I tried explaining that I didn’t want David to be alone while he was sick, and that I thought I could manage the situation safely, but she wasn’t buying it. She said I was being selfish and irresponsible.\n\nNow, my boyfriend is also upset because he feels like I didn’t fully consider the risks before agreeing to let David stay here. He says he understands I wanted to help our brother, but he’s scared and anxious about potentially getting sick. He hasn’t explicitly blamed me, but he’s definitely withdrawn and seems resentful.\n\nAm I the asshole for letting my little brother stay here despite the risk to my boyfriend? Should I have found another solution for David’s quarantine?",
