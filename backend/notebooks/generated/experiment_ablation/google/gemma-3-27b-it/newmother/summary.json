My mother-in-law *loves* buying things for him, which is sweet…but she consistently ignores requests for her to check with us FIRST. Like, we specifically asked no more toys before Christmas. She showed up yesterday with a massive Paw Patrol playset. Before that it was three different ride-on toys when he wasn’t even sitting independently yet! \n\nWe’ve tried everything – gentle reminders, direct statements (“Please don’t buy anything without asking”), explaining storage space is limited, even politely pointing out developmental appropriateness. Each time it's met with a sheepish \"Oh, I just saw it and thought of [son’s name]!\" or “I forgot you said that!” Honestly, it feels incredibly dismissive. \n\nMy wife wants to avoid conflict and suggests just accepting the gifts and donating them later. I’m getting really frustrated because it feels like my boundaries aren’t respected at all. And honestly, the sheer VOLUME of stuff is overwhelming. Am I the unreasonable one for wanting her to actually *remember* our requests? Should I just suck it up for peace?
