  "title: AITA for asking my brother to pay a dog-sitting “deposit” after last year’s fiasco?\nself_text: I (28F) love my older brother “Cal” (32M) and his dog Moose (2yo lab mix), but last year I agreed to watch Moose for “a long weekend” over the holidays that turned into 7 days because his flights got messed up. I work from home and have a cat with IBD who needs a calm environment. Moose is sweet but high-energy, has separation anxiety, and… he destroyed my hallway rug, ate two cat toys (terrifying), and scratched up my back door trying to follow me to the mailbox. I ended up paying $150 for a steam clean plus replacing the rug, and I slept on and off with Moose barking/whining at 2–4am most nights. Cal had told me he’d “Venmo me $200” for the week. He never did, and when I followed up twice he said he was “broke after travel” and then “forgot.” I dropped it to keep the peace.\n\nFast forward to this year: he asked me to watch Moose for 10 days (Dec 22–Jan 1). I said I could help, but because of last year I needed a few things in place:\n- $35/day (below our local boarding rate)\n- He provides all food/meds/toys and a crate\n- $200 refundable deposit for damages (I’d refund it within 48 hours if there’s no issue)\n- Payment up front via Venmo, so I’m not chasing during the holidays\n- Moose has to be picked up/dropped off at set times because I’m hosting my partner’s parents on the 24th (they’re allergic and my apartment requires pets to be pre-registered and a temporary pet deposit with the building, which I would pay and he’d reimburse)\n\nCal lost it and said I was “nickel-and-diming family” and “extorting him for Christmas.” He also says “Moose is family” so I shouldn’t need a deposit. I suggested alternatives: I could do drop-in walks at his place if he boards Moose, or he could ask a different friend and I’d chip in $50 towards their fee as a goodwill gesture. He said boarding is “jail” and too expensive, and accused me of caring more about my “precious cat” and rugs than his dog.\n\nOur parents got involved. Mom says I should be “nice for once” because “Cal never asks for help” (not true) and “it’s only 10 days.” Dad’s more neutral and said my conditions were “reasonable but maybe tone down the deposit.” For context, my building charges $300 for a pet deposit for visiting animals and a $50/month pet fee (even for one month), and they do check—last year I flew under the radar, but we got a notice this fall about unregistered pets. If Moose stays with me, I have to file the visitor form and pay, or I risk a fine. I explained this to Cal and offered that he could come by and register Moose himself and pay the building fees directly, but he said I was “making up rules” to avoid helping.\n\nAlso relevant: I don’t have a car. Cal’s apartment is 40 minutes away by transit (longer on holiday schedules), and he specifically wants Moose at my place because “he does better with someone 24/7.” I’ll be working M–F, and I already adjusted my schedule so I’ll be home most of those days, but the late nights and extra cleanup are a lot on top of the cat’s meds/feeding routine. I told him the deposit is there because last time there was damage and I got stiffed, and honestly it’s not even about the money so much as not wanting to argue or chase after the fact.\n\nCal posted in our family group chat that I’m “charging rent to see my nephew” and a couple cousins piled on with “it’s Christmas, just help” takes. My partner and most of my friends say my terms are fair, especially given last year and the building policies. My mom is now guilt-tripping me about how this will “ruin the holiday” if Moose ends up in a kennel.\n\nI genuinely don’t want Moose in a noisy kennel for 10 days, and I’m willing to help within my limits. But I’m not okay with repeating last year—no sleep, out-of-pocket costs, then being called greedy when I try to set boundaries up front.\n\nAITA for insisting on a daily rate + refundable damage deposit paid up front (or offering alternatives) instead of just saying yes “because family”? \nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for refusing to drive my sister to work at 5 a.m. when she lives with me rent-free?\nself_text: I (27F) own a small condo and let my younger sister (22F) move in temporarily after she broke up with her boyfriend. The arrangement was: no rent for 2 months while she got back on her feet, she helps with chores, buys her own groceries, and figures out transportation to her job.\n\nShe works at a bakery and starts at 5:30 a.m. Her car died about three weeks after she moved in. I’ve driven her a few times, but I made it clear it wasn’t a long-term thing and suggested she carpool/Uber/ask her manager to shift her schedule or pick up a bus route (we live in a city with early buses, just not super convenient).\n\nShe hasn’t followed up on any of that. Instead, she started setting her alarm for 4:45 a.m., then knocking on my door at 5 saying “I’ll be late if we don’t go now.” I get up at 7 for work and have a strict hybrid schedule; on the days I commute, I leave at 7:30 for a 9 a.m. start.\n\nThis past Monday I had a big presentation and needed sleep. The night before I reminded her I couldn’t drive her and that she should arrange a ride. She brushed me off with “We’ll see.” At 5 a.m., she banged on my door. I told her through the door I wasn’t driving and that I’d already warned her. She called me selfish, then stomped off. She ended up late, got written up, and is saying it’s my fault. She told our mom I’m “kicking her when she’s down,” and now Mom is blowing up my phone about how “family helps family.”\n\nFor context:\n- I’ve given her a rent-free place for 6 weeks so far.\n- I’ve driven her 7 times at 5 a.m. already.\n- I sent her links to bus routes and rideshare promos; she said buses are “gross” and Uber is “too expensive.”\n- She’s working full time and has money to go out on weekends, but says she’s “saving” for a car and doesn’t want to waste money on rides.\n\nI feel bad that she got written up, but I also feel like I’ve been more than accommodating, and setting a boundary shouldn’t make me the villain. AITA for refusing to drive her that morning and sticking to the boundary?\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: Why do so many U.S. public restroom stalls have big door gaps and high clearance?\nself_text: Visiting from abroad, I keep noticing that a lot of public restroom stalls in the U.S. have sizable gaps between the door and frame, plus a large space under the door. In other countries I’ve been to, stalls tend to be more “room-like” with tighter seams and lower gaps.\n\nIs there a practical reason for the U.S. style? Things like cost, ventilation, ease of cleaning, accessibility, safety/liability (e.g., checking if someone needs help), discouraging misuse, building codes, or maintenance? If it’s cost, how much cheaper is it really?\n\nAre there codes that require those clearances, or is it just industry standard? And is there any trend toward more private stall designs in newer buildings?\nsubreddit: NoStupidQuestions",
  "title: How do I politely decline contributing to a coworker’s group gift when I barely know them?\n self_text: I started at a new job about 6 weeks ago and today someone sent a group email/Slack asking for $20–$30 each for a coworker’s baby shower gift. It includes a public Google Sheet where people put their names and dollar amounts, and a Venmo link. I’ve never worked directly with this person—I’ve only been in two big meetings with them and said hello once in the kitchen. Money is a bit tight right now and I’m not comfortable putting my name next to a $0 on a public sheet or explaining my finances to a group of near-strangers.  Is there a polite way to opt out without looking like a jerk or starting off on the wrong foot? Is it normal for these collections to be public and kind of expected? If there’s a “script” for this (“Thanks for organizing! I won’t be able to participate this time but wishing them all the best.”), does that sound okay, or is there a better way to phrase it? Also, is it reasonable to ask the organizer to make the spreadsheet anonymous/optional, or is that overstepping as the new person?\n subreddit: NoStupidQuestions",
  "title: First time flying alone — what should I expect at the airport?\nself_text: I’m flying domestically in the U.S. for the first time by myself next month and I’m a little anxious about the process. A few specific questions:\n- How early should I get to the airport if I have a checked bag vs. carry-on only?\n- Where do I go first: airline counter to check a bag, or straight to security if I checked in on the app?\n- What exactly happens at TSA security (shoes, electronics, liquids)? Any tips to make it smoother?\n- Is a mobile boarding pass on my phone fine, or should I print it too just in case?\n- How do boarding groups/zones work and how do I know when it’s my turn?\n- If my flight gets delayed or the gate changes, how will I know? Do I just watch the screens/app?\n- Can I bring an empty water bottle through security and fill it up inside?\n- What happens when I land—do I just follow signs to baggage claim and look for my flight number on a carousel?\n\nI know every airport/airline can be a little different, but a general rundown or first-timer tips would really help calm my nerves. Thanks!\nsubreddit: NoStupidQuestions",
  "title: Is it normal to talk to yourself out loud when you’re alone?\nself_text: When I’m home alone I catch myself narrating what I’m doing, talking through decisions, even doing different voices sometimes. I’m late 20s, otherwise social and functional, and don’t do it around other people.\n\nIs this common or something to worry about? Does “self-talk” actually help with focus/memory, or should I try to stop? Any research or personal experiences appreciated.\nsubreddit: NoStupidQuestions",
  "title: AITA for installing a lock on my bedroom door after my roommate’s boyfriend kept “borrowing” my stuff?\n self_text: I (27F) live in a 3BR apartment with two roommates, Kayla (26F) and Jess (28F). We each pay equal rent, and we don’t have a designated storage area besides our rooms. Kayla’s boyfriend “Trent” (29M) is not on the lease but stays over 4–5 nights a week, works from our place sometimes, showers here, eats here, etc. Utilities have noticeably gone up, but that’s a side note.\n\nSince Trent started practically living here, my stuff has been “borrowed” without asking and returned dirty/broken/late or not at all:\n- My PS5 controller disappeared for a few days and came back sticky with what looked like buffalo sauce.\n- My hiking boots were sitting by the door caked in mud after a rainy weekend (I had them in my room and found out he took them “for a quick run to the bodega” that turned into a hike).\n- He took my noise-cancelling headphones to “hop on a Zoom” and I found them in Kayla’s car two days later.\n- He wore my favorite jacket out because “it was cold and right there,” and it came back smelling like smoke.\n- He’s used my protein powder and opened my mail package because “I thought it was house stuff” (it was literally addressed to me).\n\nI talked to Kayla multiple times asking for basic boundaries. I labeled my chargers and cables, put a small bin in the living room for communal stuff (I contributed extras), and said explicitly: “Please don’t take things from my room.” Kayla’s response was, “We’re all adults, this is a community vibe,” and “if you needed any of my stuff I wouldn’t care,” and “Trent didn’t mean anything by it.” Trent always apologizes with a “my bad” and a laugh, but nothing changes.\n\nTwo weeks ago I came home to find my bedroom door open (I always close it) and my external monitor unplugged from my desk and set up in the living room. That was my last straw. I emailed the landlord to ask if I could swap my interior knob for a keyed lock as long as maintenance had a copy, and he said it was fine (no drilling/altering the frame). I installed a keyed knob, gave the landlord a copy, and texted the roommate group chat that I’d done this and why. I also put an emergency key in a sealed envelope on the fridge with my name on it for literal emergencies (fire/flood/medical). I did not give Trent a key.\n\nCue drama. The next day Trent tried to “grab an HDMI cable real quick” from my room while I was at work, couldn’t get in, and texted me. I said, “No, sorry, please ask me first next time and I’ll get it for you.” He told Kayla it was “hostile” and made him feel “unwelcome.” Kayla confronted me and said I was “creating an unsafe dynamic” and “locking family out of common spaces.” I reminded her my bedroom is not a common space. She insisted that if something breaks (like the smoke detector beeping) they shouldn’t have to wait for me to come home to get my toolkit. I said they can use the communal one (we have one under the sink) or text me and I’ll send a video/come home if it’s urgent. Also…don’t store non-communal tools in my room?\n\nA few days later during a maintenance visit, Trent told the maintenance guy he needed into my room “to check an outlet.” Maintenance said he had a key from the landlord but wouldn’t open it unless I approved. I said no (over text). Kayla blew up that now “the vibe is weird” and I need to either remove the lock or give Trent a key since he’s “here all the time.” Jess is neutral but said she “sees both sides.” I offered to put a small lockbox in the hall for my HDMI/chargers if that’s the sticking point, but I’m not removing the lock.\n\nAdditional info:\n- I did ask Trent directly not to go in my room. He said “Oh totally” and then it happened again.\n- I asked Kayla if Trent could chip in $30/month for utilities since he’s here more nights than not (hot showers, daily coffee, WFH, laundry sometimes). She said that was “petty nickel-and-diming.”\n- The lock is a standard keyed interior knob. Landlord has a copy, and there’s an emergency key on the fridge (sealed). I’m not blocking egress and didn’t alter the door frame. Lease says no deadbolts on bedroom doors; this isn’t a deadbolt.\n- I’m not locking up shared items. I intentionally moved anything “house” (vacuum, common cleaning stuff, communal tools) to the hall closet. The only reason the HDMI/toolkit thing came up is because they were borrowing mine instead of the communal ones.\n\nKayla says I’m making the household feel “unfriendly” and “paranoid.” From my perspective, boundaries and consent were ignored multiple times and I took a reasonable step to protect my space and belongings. I’m willing to keep an emergency key accessible and compromise with a small shared tech bin in the hall, but I don’t want Trent to have permanent access to my bedroom.\n\nAITA for installing the lock and refusing to give my roommate’s boyfriend a key?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for throwing out my roommate’s “meal prep” after it had been molding in the fridge for weeks?\nself_text: I (26F) share an apartment with two roommates: Kay (27F) and Max (25M). We split one standard-size fridge. On move-in we all agreed to a “clean out on Sundays” rule and to label dates on leftovers/meal prep.  Kay is really into “meal prep” but then doesn’t actually eat it. She’ll cook a huge batch, label it for the week, eat maybe one serving, and then it sits. I’ve reminded her (nicely) multiple times when something is past date. She either says “I’ll get to it tomorrow” or “It’s fine, it’s just fermenting.”  For the past three weeks, there were 6+ containers of chicken/rice/veg and a pot of soup that had visible mold and a sour smell. The bottom produce drawer was sticky from something that leaked, and the fridge smelled every time we opened it. I texted the group chat with photos the last two Sundays and asked if she could toss it. She read the messages and replied “Yep!” but never did.  This week I had my parents over for dinner. I asked Kay again that morning; she said she was “too busy” but would “handle it tonight.” I didn’t want the place reeking when my parents arrived, so I put on gloves, double-bagged everything that was obviously spoiled (I took timestamped photos of the labels/mold first), wiped down the shelves/drawer, and ran the trash out. I saved two sealed, in-date items that looked fine.  Kay came home, saw the empty shelf, and blew up. She accused me of “food shaming,” “wasting money,” and “violating boundaries” by touching her stuff. I explained I’d asked for three weeks, it was past date, moldy, and we have a shared space with a house rule. I also replaced the two warped containers with new ones from Target out of courtesy.  Max is on my side and said the smell was horrible; he also said he thought the rule was clear. Kay now says I owe her the full “value” of everything tossed (she claims ~$80) and an apology for “embarrassing” her before my parents came over. I offered $20 to keep the peace, but she says that’s “insulting.”  AITA for throwing it out? Should I pay what she’s asking or stick to the house rule? For what it’s worth, her stuff took up almost half the fridge while it sat there, and we had to keep our groceries in the crisper to make room.\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for telling my brother he can’t borrow my car anymore after I had to pay his tickets and a tow?\nself_text: I (27F) own the only car in my immediate family that’s reliable enough for commuting. My younger brother “Jay” (24M) doesn’t have a car and has been couch surfing and piecing together gig jobs while hunting for something steady. When he asked to borrow my car for interviews or “important stuff,” I said yes with conditions: tell me when you need it, no one else drives it, return it with a full tank, and if you get any tickets/tolls, you pay them immediately because the car and insurance are in my name.\n\nWithin two months I’ve gotten: two street-cleaning tickets, a red light camera ticket, and an unpaid toll notice. All came to me, with my name on them. The first two I paid to avoid late fees and asked Jay to reimburse; he sent me $20 on a $68 ticket and said he’d “get the rest Friday.” Friday came and went. The red light ticket he argued was “bogus” and wanted to fight it, but he never filed anything, so the fine increased and I had to pay to keep it from going to collections under my name. The toll became a violation fee because he “lost the envelope.”\n\nLast week was the last straw. He still had a spare key from when I let him use the car earlier. He took the car without asking because his girlfriend needed to go to urgent care (I found this out after the fact). He parked in a street-sweeping zone and the car got towed. The tow lot called me because the registration is mine. I had to miss half a day of work to get it out and paid $325 between the tow and storage. Jay said he’d pay me back on payday and sent me $50, then posted new sneakers and a bar tab on IG.\n\nI told him he’s not allowed to use my car anymore and I took back the spare. I also told him if he needs a ride to an interview, I’ll drive him if I’m free or help pay half for a rental for the day so the liability isn’t on me. He got mad and said I’m “stranding him” and I “know he’s trying to get on his feet.” Our mom called me selfish and said “family helps family,” and that the tow wasn’t his fault because it was an emergency. I pointed out that all the tickets, late fees, and the tow are in my name and could affect my insurance or even my job (I need a clean record for my work policy). I also suggested if Mom wants him to have a car so badly, she can add him to her insurance or co-sign; she said she “can’t afford it.”\n\nNow Jay is saying he missed a second interview because I wouldn’t let him have the car and that I ruined his shot. He never asked me to drive him, and there are buses/Ubers, but he says I “know how expensive those are.” I feel like I gave reasonable alternatives and was burned multiple times when I tried to help.\n\nAITA for putting my foot down about the car?\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for refusing to be my family’s “IT support” during the holidays?\n self_text: I (27M) work in tech, but I’m not anyone’s official tech support. Every holiday, my family treats me like the on-call help desk. It always starts with “can you just take a quick look?” and turns into hours of fixing printers, resetting passwords, cleaning malware, setting up TVs/streaming, Wi‑Fi, phones, etc. I’ve missed games, dessert, and actual conversations multiple years in a row because I’m stuck in someone’s office or on the floor behind a TV cabinet.  This year I tried to set boundaries. I messaged our family group chat a week before Thanksgiving:  - I’m happy to help ONE issue per person. - Please have passwords/charger/logins ready and sit with me while we fix it so you learn. - No work VPNs/taxes/QuickBooks/business laptops. - I’ll do it during a 2‑hour window after dessert. Outside that window, I’m off. - If you need more than that, I can schedule time another day or you can Venmo me $40/hr (less than my normal freelance rate).  Immediate responses were mixed. My mom said “family helps family.” My uncle did the “it only takes 5 minutes” thing (last year his “5 minutes” was 2 hours of driver updates). My sister called me selfish and said I was “monetizing family.” A couple cousins actually said thank you and that the structure was fair.  This weekend we did an early get-together at my aunt’s. I fixed my grandma’s phone photos (took 20 minutes) during the window. After that, my dad brought me his laptop with pop-ups and “free antivirus” all over it and asked me to “wipe it and make it fast again.” I said I’d already used my one-per-person time, and a full clean/reset is a few hours and not something I can do there. I offered to take it home later this week and do it properly. He got mad and said I was “too good to help my own family” and that it was disrespectful to put “rules” on helping.  Mom now says if I’m going to “cause drama” I should either “just help like always” or skip Thanksgiving. I told her I’ll still come, but I’m not spending the day under TVs or on the phone with Comcast. She says I’m making the holiday about me.

  "title: AITA for leaving Thanksgiving early after my sister took credit for the entire meal I cooked?\nself_text: I (29F) was asked by my parents (both 60s) to host-cook Thanksgiving at their house this year because they don’t have the energy to do the full spread anymore but still wanted it at their place. My sister “Sara” (33F) said she’d “handle desserts.” Cool. We split tasks on a shared doc. I planned the menu, bought the groceries (my parents reimbursed half), brined and roasted the turkey, made gravy, stuffing, green bean casserole, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, two salads, and rolls. I did everything in their kitchen so my parents could relax and still have it “at home.”\n\nSara showed up two hours late with a store-bought pumpkin pie and a sleeve of premade cookie dough, then immediately started rearranging the table “for vibes” while I was basting, and told our relatives (who were trickling in) “I’ve been in the kitchen since 7 a.m.” She started taking pictures and posting them with captions like “12-hour kitchen marathon but it’s worth it to feed the fam.” I didn’t say anything at first because I hate drama and figured it’s just social media.\n\nWhen the turkey came out to rest, she told me I was “plating wrong,” took my serving spoons out of my hands, and told me to “go change out of my cooking clothes and get cute for guests” because she “had it from here.” When we sat down, my dad toasted Sara for “putting together such an amazing meal” and “keeping family traditions alive.” I lightly corrected him (“I made most of the dishes; Sara brought dessert!”) and Sara jumped in with “We cooked together!” Then my mom said, “Well, Sara’s always been the hostess in her heart,” and a couple of relatives chimed in with compliments for Sara’s “hard work.”\n\nI was embarrassed and honestly hurt. I’d been on my feet since 6 a.m., burned a finger, and was just exhausted. After dinner, while I was clearing plates, my aunt pulled me aside and said, “It’s a little tacky to try to take credit from your sister on a holiday.” That was the last straw. I told my parents I wasn’t feeling well, packed up my knives/leftover containers, and left around 7:30. I cried in my car and went home.\n\nNow my parents and Sara are calling me dramatic, saying I “ruined the night” and “stormed out.” Sara texted that she “didn’t mean to offend” but that “hosting is more than cooking, it’s curating the experience,” and that she “handled the aesthetics” and “guest flow,” so it’s “not like I did nothing.” My dad says I should apologize to keep the peace because “family events aren’t about credit.”\n\nI don’t think I would’ve cared about her posts if she hadn’t doubled down in front of everyone and if I hadn’t been dismissed when I tried to clarify. But I also recognize leaving early impacted the vibe for my parents. AITA for walking out instead of sucking it up for the night?\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",

What do the monitors mean?  - How early should I get there, and what do I do while I wait?  - Boarding groups: how do they work, and what happens if I miss my group call?  - Bathroom/food: can I still leave the gate area to grab something and come back?  - If the flight is delayed, do I need to tell anyone or just wait?

  "title: AITA for refusing to lend my car to my roommate for her delivery side hustle, but still asking her to split gas when we run errands together?\nself_text: I (26F) live with my roommate “Kay” (27F). I own the only car in our apartment. It’s titled/insured to me; the policy explicitly says no regular drivers outside listed ones (just me and my mom), and our lease also says we’re responsible for any vehicle-related issues on property.\n\nKay recently picked up a delivery side hustle (DoorDash/Instacart/etc.) and asked to “borrow” my car 4–6 hours a day, most days. I told her no, because:\n- Insurance won’t cover her if something happens (she’s not a listed driver).\n- Delivery use often requires commercial coverage, which I don’t have.\n- Wear/tear + mileage depreciation is real, and I can’t afford surprise repairs.\n\nI offered alternative help: I’d drive her to a couple shifts a week if timing worked, or she could rent a car through those gig-company programs. She called me selfish and said if we’re “family,” I should trust her.\n\nFast-forward: we do a big joint Costco/Grocery trip every 1–2 weeks (we share staples like TP, rice, cleaning stuff). I usually drive. In the past, Kay pitched in $10–$15 for gas on those trips. After I refused the delivery borrowing, she said she’s “done paying gas forever” because I’m “gatekeeping” the car.\n\nI told her borrowing the car solo for a money-making gig = huge liability and expense for me. Splitting gas on a shared errand run we both benefit from is normal. She said I’m trying to “profit off her” twice.\n\nFor context:\n- I pay everything car-related: payment, insurance, registration, maintenance, parking.\n- She’s never contributed to those fixed costs.\n- Public transit exists but turns our errand run into a 3+ hour ordeal with multiple bags.\n- I’ve given her rides to work/classes plenty without asking anything unless it’s out of my way.\n- I’m not against her doing the side hustle; I’m against risking my insurance/finances.\n\nNow some mutual friends think I’m being petty asking for gas money “after” denying her use. I feel like these are two separate issues: lending out my car for commercial use is a hard no; splitting gas on shared trips seems reasonable.\n\nAITA?\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for asking my sister and BIL to stop using our apartment as their gym locker room?\n self_text: I (29F) live with my partner (30M) in a small one-bedroom right off a popular running/bike trail. My sister (27F) and her husband (28M) recently started training for a half marathon and discovered that our place is a super convenient spot to park, run, and then come up to shower and “refuel.”  At first it was fine — nice to see them more. But it’s escalated to 3–4 times a week, usually unannounced or with a “we’re downstairs in 5” text. They come up sweaty, track dirt on the floors, use our bathroom for 45+ minutes each, load the washer with their wet clothes, eat our food (“we’ll replace it!” but rarely do), and leave a pile of damp towels. They’ve shown up as late as 8:45pm to shower when I have early shifts.  Last week I set some boundaries: - Please give 24 hours notice so we can plan around it - Max twice per week - No showers after 9pm - Bring your own towels/toiletries and take sweaty laundry home  Sister said it was “totally reasonable,” but her husband blew up and called me petty for “gatekeeping water” and said it costs us “literally nothing.” He also said I should be “supportive of family trying to be healthy” and that I’m “lucky” our location is convenient. He added that if family can’t drop by, “what’s the point of family?”  Since then, they’ve ignored the 24-hour notice twice and still tried to come up. I told them no both times and suggested the public rec center (has showers, $3 day pass), or that they could park at the trailhead and shower at home. Now my BIL is ranting in the family group chat about me “kicking them out” and my mom is hinting I should “be flexible” because “it’s just a season.”  For what it’s worth, our water/electric bills have noticeably jumped, our bathroom is constantly damp, and I’m doing extra cleaning. Also, I work early mornings and my partner works from home — having people streaming in and out is disruptive. I’m not trying to be a jerk; I just want my home to be, well, my home.

I’m a bit of a cooking nerd and saved up for a small set of good knives (chef’s knife, petty knife, bread knife), which I keep sharpened and clean. From day one I labeled my stuff and told everyone they’re happy to use my pots/pans if they ask, but the knives are off-limits unless I’m home and can clean/store them myself.\n\nBen has a habit of “borrowing first, apologizing later.” A couple weeks ago I came home to my chef’s knife sitting in the sink, blade-down in standing water, with a cutting board smeared in raw chicken juices nearby. He later admitted he used it to butcher bone-in thighs because “mine are too dull and yours cut like butter.” I explained (again) that knives shouldn’t be left soaking, putting blades-down in a sink is unsafe, and cross-contamination is a real thing. He said he rinsed it “a little” and would clean it properly after his shower but then forgot.\n\nI tried to be chill and just reiterated my boundary: don’t use my knives. I bought a cheap magnetic strip to hang them out of the way. A few days later I noticed nicks along the edge of the petty knife; Ben had used it on a plate and then “honed” it by dragging it back and forth on the rough side of the granite counter because “I saw a chef do it on TikTok.” I was… not thrilled.\n\nThat night I told him (calmly) he can use literally anything else in the kitchen but my knives are a hard no. I even linked him a $30 decent starter knife on Amazon and offered to split it with him. He rolled his eyes and said I was being dramatic about “basic kitchen tools.” Lila and Noor were on my side and told him to back off.\n\nThis week I came home to find my bread knife in the dishwasher (top rack??), and that was the final straw. I bought a slim lockable knife case and put my knives inside. I’m not trying to be Fort Knox, but I’m done playing “find the blade.” I also put a little sign on the inside of the cabinet where they used to hang that says “Please do not use OP’s knives. Ask if urgent. Thanks!”\n\nBen blew up and said I’m “policing” a communal space and making him feel unwelcome in his own home. He says if I don’t want people to use something, I shouldn’t store it in the kitchen at all. He also accused me of “gatekeeping cooking” because my stuff is “nicer.” I told him I’m not stopping him from cooking—he has his own knives, I offered to help him choose better ones within budget, and he can borrow nearly everything else if he asks. I’m just trying to keep my tools safe and the kitchen sanitary.\n\nNow he’s sulking and has been telling anyone who comes over that I “locked the kitchen.” Lila and Noor think he’s being ridiculous, but my sister (who doesn’t cook) said I’m being a bit precious and it’s “just knives.”\n\nFor what it’s worth, I didn’t bring this up mid-meal or anything—I waited until a house meeting night, stated the issues, showed the chips and rust spots that formed, and set the boundary clearly. I also cleaned the sink/counter thoroughly after the raw chicken incident without making a scene. I think I’ve been reasonable, but I know shared spaces can be tricky.\n\nAITA for locking up my knives and telling Ben he’s not allowed to use them anymore, even if that means storing “personal” items in a communal kitchen?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for asking my husband to sleep in the guest room until he stops vaping in bed?\n self_text: I (29F) have been married to “Jake” (31M) for 3 years. He switched from cigarettes to vaping about a year ago, which I supported at first because I thought it would be a step toward quitting altogether. The problem is he vapes constantly, including in bed at night. I’ve asked him to step into the bathroom or go to the living room, and he says it’s “just vapor” and not a big deal.\n\nI have asthma that’s usually mild, but I’ve noticed more tightness in my chest and a cough over the last few months. I wake up with a sore throat a couple of times a week. I finally saw my doctor last month; she didn’t go on a crusade about vaping, but she did advise I avoid any aerosolized irritants in enclosed spaces, especially while sleeping.\n\nI brought this up with Jake and set a boundary: no vaping in the bedroom at all, and ideally not inside if I’m home with the windows closed. He agreed for about two days, then started sneaking hits and brushing it off with “it’s cold outside” or “I’m half asleep, I don’t even remember doing it.”\n\nTwo weeks ago I woke up at 3 AM wheezing while he was hitting his vape under the blanket. I got scared and frustrated and told him I was done negotiating this. I asked him to sleep in the guest room until he can go 30 days without vaping indoors, especially in bed. I said if he slips, the 30 days resets. I also bought him some nicotine gum and suggested we look into a cessation program together.\n\nHe got really mad and said I was “exiling” him from our bedroom like he’s a child, and that I’m being dramatic because “it’s not smoke.” He’s been in the guest room for 10 days now. We’re otherwise fine during the day, but he keeps making comments like “How long do I have to sleep in exile for you to feel in control?” and “You’re making a habit into a moral failing.”\n\nFor what it’s worth: I do not vape or smoke. I’m the one who washes bedding, runs air purifiers, and cracks windows when the weather allows. I’ve offered compromises (step into the bathroom with the fan on, use the patio, don’t bring it to bed) and he either forgets or ignores it at night. He doesn’t do this at work or around his parents’ house—only at home, mostly in our room.\n\nHe says I’m prioritizing my comfort over his “coping mechanism” and that a marriage bed shouldn’t be used as punishment. I feel like I’m enforcing a reasonable health boundary in the one place I have to breathe for 7–8 hours.\n\nAITA for asking him to sleep in the guest room until he can stop vaping in our bedroom?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for locking up my cookware after my roommates ruined multiple pans the week before Thanksgiving?\nself_text: I (27F) share an apartment with two roommates, Jess (26F) and Mark (28M). I own 90% of the kitchen stuff. House rule: if you use my gear, hand-wash nonstick, wooden utensils only, no steel wool, carbon steel and cast iron never go in the dishwasher. I put labels on the cabinet and a laminated care sheet.\n\nLast week, Mark hosted a “Friendsgiving test run” while I was at work. He:\n- put my carbon steel wok in the dishwasher (it warped and lost its seasoning),\n- used my chef’s knife on a glass cutting board (chipped the edge),\n- blasted my nonstick skillet on high with aerosol spray (now flakes),\n- left my cast iron pan soaking overnight (rusted).\n\nI woke up to the mess, took photos, and sent a calm text asking them to split replacement/repair costs. Quotes I got: $220 to regrind/restore the knife and reseason, $140 for a comparable wok, $60 for a mid-tier nonstick. I didn’t ask for cast iron money because I can fix that.\n\nJess admitted she “scrubbed the sticky stuff” with steel wool on the nonstick. Their response: “It’s just kitchen stuff, normal wear and tear.” They offered $50 total.\n\nSo I bought a lockable rolling cart, moved my knives/pans/spices into it, and now I roll it out when I cook and put it back in my room after. I also labeled the cheap Ikea pans as communal and bought a basic house knife so no one goes without.\n\nThey’re calling me dramatic and “holding the kitchen hostage,” saying it kills the vibe when I roll my “toolbox” in. I said I’ll unlock everything if they cover repair/replacement and agree to the care rules. Now there’s tension and our friend group is split. My sister says I’m petty and should chalk it up to living with people.\n\nAITA?\n\nRelevant info:\n- We never agreed my gear was communal; I said “you can use it if you follow the rules.”\n- I work in pastry; these are tools I saved up for and use for side gigs.\n- I’m only asking for the knife to be professionally reground and the pieces they destroyed replaced; not seeking money for the cast iron I can fix.\n\nUpdate: We met last night. They offered $100 “for the knife.” I countered with sending the knife to a sharpener and sharing the invoice, plus splitting a mid-range wok to replace mine they warped. They want to “think about it.” Until then, the cart stays.\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: Why are clothing sizes so inconsistent across brands (and even within the same brand)?\nself_text: This has been driving me nuts. I can wear a “medium” t‑shirt at Brand A, need a “large” at Brand B, and an “extra small” at Brand C. Same with jeans: a 32x30 at one store fits perfectly, another 32x30 is falling off, and a third is too tight to button. I’ve even had different fits in the same brand depending on the line or the color/fabric.\n\n- Is there any actual standard for sizing, or is it all just up to each brand?\n- How do brands decide their size charts? Is “vanity sizing” a real thing only in women’s clothes, or does it happen in men’s too?\n- Do fabric types (stretch, raw denim, pre-shrunk cotton, etc.) and manufacturing differences cause this much variation, or is it mostly intentional brand-by-brand fit “philosophy”?\n- Why can two items with the same labeled measurements fit differently (e.g., two 32x30 jeans that clearly aren’t the same)?\n- Any practical tips for shopping online besides “order multiple sizes”? Are size charts and garment measurements reliable, or is there something better to look for?\n\nI realize “it depends,” but I’d love to understand what’s going on behind the scenes and how to reduce the guesswork.\nsubreddit: NoStupidQuestions",
  "title: AITA for asking my sister to replace my cast iron skillet after she “deep cleaned” it right before Thanksgiving?\n self_text: I (29F) was hosting Thanksgiving for the first time this year. I’ve been slowly building up my cookware and was excited to do the turkey and sides, including cornbread and pan gravy in my well-seasoned 12” cast iron that I’ve had for 7 years. It’s nothing fancy or heirloom, but it’s perfectly seasoned and basically nonstick at this point.\n\nMy sister “Kayla” (26F) came over the night before to “help.” While I was out grabbing a last-minute ingredient, she decided my kitchen “needed a proper scrub” because “you can’t cook for family with greasy pans.” I came back to find my cast iron in the dishwasher mid-cycle. She had also taken steel wool to it, hit it with dish soap, and then ran it through a high-temp dishwasher because “heat sterilizes.” After that she put it in my oven on self-clean “to finish baking off the gunk.” The pan came out gray, flaky, and actually rusting at the edges. The handle was so hot it scorched a towel.\n\nI was livid but tried to keep it together. I told her cast iron shouldn’t go in the dishwasher or self-clean, and the “gunk” was seasoning. She rolled her eyes and said, “It’s just a pan. If your cookware is so high maintenance that soap ruins it, that’s on the cookware.” The next morning I spent an hour trying to rescue it (scrubbed, re-oiled, baked), but it wasn’t usable for gravy or cornbread, so I had to change plans and lost time. Dinner still happened, but I was stressed and snappy.\n\nAfter the holiday I asked Kayla to either replace the skillet (I linked the exact model for ~$50) or pay to have it professionally stripped/resurfaced at a local place (more expensive, I know). She said I’m being petty, it’s “just a pan,” and I should be grateful she cleaned. My mom is siding with her, saying I embarrassed Kayla by “making a scene about a pot” and that I should take the lesson to “buy normal pans.”\n\nFor what it’s worth, I didn’t ask for some $$$ boutique pan. I just want the tool she wrecked replaced, or help fixing it. If a friend borrowed something and broke it, I’d expect to replace it. Kayla says that because she was helping me prep and didn’t act “maliciously,” I’m an AH for putting a price tag on a family holiday.\n\nAITA for asking her to replace the skillet she destroyed?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",

  "title: AITA for telling my cousin she can’t bring her dog to Thanksgiving at my house?\n self_text: I (29F) am hosting Thanksgiving for the first time in my small townhouse. It’ll be 10 people, mostly immediate family plus my cousin “Jenna” (31F) who recently got a large rescue dog (about 80 lbs). She’s had him ~6 months. He’s sweet but not well trained yet—jumps, counter-surfs, and has had a few “accidents” at other family gatherings.  I have a few concerns:  - My partner (30M) has mild dog allergies that are manageable with short visits but get bad if fur/dander is everywhere. - I just bought a new couch and had the carpets cleaned because I’m hosting. - My downstairs neighbor already complains about noise and my HOA is strict about pets in common areas (we have to use the back entry for dogs).  Last year at my aunt’s house, Jenna’s dog grabbed a pie off the counter and knocked over a plate stack. It wasn’t the end of the world, but it was chaotic and stressful. Everyone chalked it up to “he’s new, he’ll learn,” but so far he still does all of that.  I told Jenna she’s welcome but I can’t have the dog inside my place for the whole day. I offered compromises:  - She could bring a crate and set it up in the garage for short breaks (heated, safe, lots of airflow—basically the mudroom). - She could come early and take him for a long walk and then keep him in her car for short stretches (it’s cold where we live but not below freezing, and she has a temperature monitor and remote start). - I can send her home with a full plate and dessert if she decides it’s easier to skip. - I even offered to split the cost of a local doggy daycare for the day.  She got upset and said he’s her ESA and she doesn’t go anywhere without him. She said I’m being heartless and “anti-dog.” I love dogs and grew up with them, I just don’t think my place is the right environment for an untrained large dog on a crowded holiday.  Now my aunt (her mom) is saying I should “be flexible” for family. My mom thinks my boundaries are reasonable. My partner is trying to stay out of it but is worried about his allergies flaring up.  I feel bad because I know the holidays can be tough and the dog helps her anxiety, but I genuinely tried to offer alternatives. AITA for saying she can’t bring the dog?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for flipping the breaker to my roommate’s space heater when he left it running all day?\n self_text: I (29F) live with my roommate “Kyle” (31M) in an older apartment with iffy wiring. Our lease specifically says “no high-wattage space heaters,” and our building has had two small electrical fires in other units in the past few years (both from overloaded outlets, per management emails).\n\nKyle works odd hours and is always cold. About a month ago he bought a big space heater online (the kind that pulls 1500W on high) and started running it in his room. I told him I was worried about the wiring and the lease rules; he said he’d only use it on low and never when he’s not home.\n\nCut to last week: I came home from work at 6pm and heard the heater humming through his door. He had left for a 12-hour shift at 7am. The door was closed, the heater was on high, and a flannel shirt was half draped over the side of it (I don’t think intentionally, just tossed on a chair and slipped down). The room was toasty and smelled a little “hot.” I tried calling and texting him—no response.\n\nI unplugged the heater, moved it away from everything, aired out the room, and texted him again to please call me. He finally replied “my bad” around 10pm. I told him this can’t happen again because it’s a fire hazard and our lease prohibits it.\n\nTwo days later it happened again—heater on high, door closed, he’d left for work. I called, no response. This time when I unplugged it, the outlet faceplate was warm. I got freaked out and flipped the breaker for his bedroom before leaving for an evening class so the heater couldn’t be turned back on while I was gone.\n\nKyle came home before me, realized his power was off, and blew up my phone. He said I had “no right” to cut power to “his room,” that I’m controlling, and that I should’ve “trusted him.” I told him I don’t trust a running heater in an empty room with warm outlets in a building that’s literally had electrical fires. He says I overreacted and should’ve just “reminded him nicely.”\n\nNow he’s sulking and telling mutual friends I “violate his space.” I suggested we buy a safe, lower-wattage radiant panel together or get the landlord to install a baseboard unit (with permission) and add it to rent. He says he’s not paying extra to be warm in “his own room.”\n\nI feel like I chose the lesser evil to prevent a bigger problem (fire, lease violation).

  "title: AITA for turning off the Wi‑Fi at midnight because my roommate’s boyfriend games loudly in our living room?\n self_text: I (24F) share a 2BR apartment with “Sam” (25F). We both work early shifts and agreed on quiet hours from 11pm–7am in our roommate agreement. About two months ago, Sam’s boyfriend “Jake” (27M) started staying over 4–5 nights a week. He brings his gaming laptop and sets up in our living room. He uses a headset, but he still yells at his teammates, clicks insanely loud, and gets really animated during late-night matches.   I’ve asked them nicely a few times to move the setup into Sam’s room during weeknights or to limit the late sessions. Sam says her room has bad airflow and Jake’s laptop “needs to be near the router” because “Ethernet is more stable.” I bought a long Ethernet cable and offered it to them. They still stayed in the living room. I tried white noise, earplugs, even foam weather stripping on my door. I’m still waking up.   Last week (Wednesday), it was 12:15am and they were still going despite me reminding them about quiet hours at 11:00 and again at 11:30. After the second reminder, Sam said, “Just close your door. This is the only time he can decompress.” I was exhausted and had a 5:30am alarm, so I used our router app and paused the Wi‑Fi on all devices. I went to sleep.   The next morning Sam was livid. Jake lost “ranked points” because he got disconnected and apparently there’s some penalty. He called me childish and said I “owe him $50” for what he lost. Sam said I’m “controlling” and “weaponizing utilities.” I pointed out that we have quiet hours in writing, I offered solutions (Ethernet, moving to her room, cutting it short on weeknights), and I only did it after two warnings.   Now Sam says either I “never touch the Wi‑Fi again” or I can “find somewhere else to live.” I’m considering proposing an addendum: no overnight guests on weeknights and/or no living room gaming after 11pm, plus if Jake is essentially living here and using utilities, he should chip in for internet.

My sister “Lena” (32F) is getting married in March and asked me (I’m her MOH) to host her bridal shower at my place in January for 25–30 people.\n\nI said no because:\n- The guest list is triple my building’s cap.\n- My living room seats maybe 6, tops. Everyone else would be standing, crammed into the kitchen hallway.\n- We’ve had two recent noise warnings because neighbors WFH and are touchy about weekend gatherings.\n- The freight elevator needs to be booked a week in advance for deliveries and there’s a fee.\n\nI offered a bunch of alternatives:\n- Split the cost to rent our building’s community room (fits 40, has tables/chairs and a kitchenette). I said I’d cover $300 and do all decor, set-up/clean-up, desserts, and invites.\n- Do it at our parents’ house (bigger space, backyard, free parking).\n- Ask her future MIL if she’d like to host (she offered months ago).\n- Host a smaller “tea” style shower at my place for immediate family only (8–10 people), and do the bigger one elsewhere.\n\nLena said I’m “being difficult” and that bridal showers are “supposed to be at the MOH’s home.” She said, “It’s one afternoon—what’s the worst that could happen?” Mom chimed in that I should “just make it work” because it’s “tradition,” and accused me of prioritizing my neighbors over my sister.

  "title: Why do many landlords require income 3x the rent?\n self_text: I keep seeing the “must make 3x rent” rule on apartment listings. What’s the actual reasoning behind that number specifically? Is it based on average budgets, default rates, or just a rule of thumb that stuck around?  For context: I’m looking at a place that’s $1,800/month. My base salary is $62k (so roughly 2.9x), plus I have savings and low debt. My credit is good and I’ve never missed rent, but the listing says 3x is a hard cutoff.  A few questions:  - Is 3x ever negotiable if you have strong savings/credit or a long rental history?  - Do co-signers or higher security deposits meaningfully change the calculus for landlords?  - How do freelancers/contractors who have variable income typically get evaluated?  - Do areas with higher cost of living ever use a different multiplier?

Since USB-C Power Delivery exists and can go pretty high wattage now, why isn’t it the standard on every new laptop?\n\n- Is it mainly a cost thing for manufacturers, or are there technical limits with USB-C PD (like max wattage or heat) that make barrel chargers better for some laptops?\n- Do gaming/workstation laptops that need 180W–240W+ avoid USB-C because PD can’t handle it reliably yet?\n- Are there safety/certification or durability reasons (e.g., port wear) that keep some brands on proprietary chargers?\n- If I plug a 65W USB-C charger into a laptop that really wants 100W, will it just charge slowly, or can it harm the laptop?\n- Conversely, can using a 140W or 240W USB-C charger damage a laptop that only needs 60–90W, or does the laptop “negotiate” safely?\n\nWould love a simple explanation on why we’re not at “one charger to rule them all” yet.\nsubreddit: NoStupidQuestions",

My apartment has a tiny living room with a small couch (not a sleeper), and I have a strict building rule about quiet hours and no overnight guests beyond two people at a time without prior approval. Also, Zack has “crashed” here once before, left the place a mess, and woke my neighbors at 3am. I got a warning from my landlord.  I told him I can’t host them overnight, but I’d be happy to meet up for brunch or coffee, and I sent them a list of affordable hostels/hotels nearby. He got snippy and said “family should help family” and that I’m being “stingy” because it’s “just a few hours of sleep.” He then looped in my aunt (his mom), who called to say I’m “slamming the door on family” and that “at their age everyone couchesurfs.”  I repeated that I’m not comfortable risking my lease or my job (I need sleep), and offered to store their bags for the day and let them change before they go out.

Is there a reason for it (turnover, “energy,” masking kitchen noise, acoustics, licensing issues, etc.)? Do managers actually want it that loud, or is it just whatever the default setting is?

For the past month, he’s gotten into making protein smoothies every morning at 6 a.m. using a pretty loud countertop blender.\n\nOur building has thin walls and posted quiet hours from 10 p.m.–7 a.m. The blender wakes me up every time, and last week our next-door neighbor knocked to ask us to keep it down because it woke their toddler too.\n\nI’ve tried to be reasonable. I asked if he could:\n- Make his smoothie the night before and keep it in the fridge\n- Use a shaker bottle in the morning instead\n- Wait until 7 a.m. (when quiet hours end)\n- Use a smaller/quiet blender or put the base on a rubber mat to reduce vibration\n- Blend in the bathroom with the door closed and fan on (it’s furthest from bedrooms)\nI even offered to buy the mat and a shaker bottle myself.\n\nKyle says I’m being controlling and that “people use kitchens in the morning,” and claims the landlord’s quiet hours aren’t enforceable for “normal living sounds.” He also says blended smoothies separate and taste gross if made the night before. He refused to wait until 7 because he leaves at 6:30.\n\nTwo mornings ago, after being woken up again, I came out and reminded him about quiet hours. He rolled his eyes and said he’d be “done in 30 seconds.” I said if he won’t compromise, I’ll talk to the landlord since it’s a posted policy and a neighbor has already complained. He got pissed and said I was “weaponizing the lease over a smoothie.”\n\nNow it’s tense. I don’t want to be the fun police, but I’m exhausted and it’s not just me being bothered. I’m not asking him to stop making smoothies—just not during quiet hours, or to use a quieter method. AITA for pushing this?\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: Why do public restroom stalls have such big gaps at the bottom and on the sides?\n self_text: I’ve noticed in a lot of public bathrooms (airports, malls, schools), the stall doors have a big gap at the bottom and sometimes you can see through the side crack too. Is this just to save money on materials, or are there actual design/safety reasons (cleaning, airflow, emergency access, code requirements, etc.)?

  "title: AITA for locking the thermostat with a PIN after my roommate kept cranking it to 80°F?\n self_text: I (27F) share a 3BR rental house with two roommates, “Sarah” (30F) and “Mark” (26M). We split rent and utilities evenly. It’s an older house with meh insulation, so our winter bill is always the highest.  Last winter our gas/elec bill jumped to $420/month (normally ~$180–$220). I started paying attention and noticed the thermostat was frequently set to 78–80°F. I run warm and get migraines in high heat, so I brought it up. We agreed to a range of 68–70°F in the day and 65°F at night, with space heaters/blankets if needed. Everyone said “sure.”  Two weeks later, temps were back to 78–80°. I asked in the group chat; Sarah admitted she bumped it because her small dog “gets cold” and she “can’t function when she’s chilly.” I offered solutions: I bought her a ceramic space heater for her room, a heated dog bed, and a door draft stopper. She used the dog bed but still cranked the heat.  We tried a few compromises:  - I proposed splitting utilities by usage (eg, she pays a higher portion in winter if the thermostat is consistently higher). She said that’s “nickel-and-diming” and refused.  - I proposed 70°F during the day and 66°F at night, with her using the space heater in her room. She agreed, then… bumped it again the next day.  - I asked her to text before changing the temp so we could agree. She said she “doesn’t need permission to not freeze in her own home.”  After the third huge bill in a row, I bought a compatible smart thermostat (cleared with our landlord), installed it, and set a PIN. I set the programmed schedule at 69°F daytime, 66°F overnight. I told them both in the group chat, explained why, and reminded Sarah she has a space heater and heated dog bed. I also said if either of them wanted a different schedule, we can vote, and if it’s 2–1, we’ll do it (I’m not trying to be a dictator).  Sarah blew up, calling me controlling and “weaponizing technology,” and said she’s reporting me to the landlord for “modifying HVAC access” (landlord already approved the smart thermostat; he just wants the old one saved for move-out). She also said I’m “cruel” for making her dog cold. For what it’s worth, my cheap room temp sensor shows the common areas at 68–70°F in the day; her room is 70–72°F with the space heater low. Dog is in a heated bed and wearing a sweater (her choice) most of the time anyway.  Mark thinks my PIN solution is fair because we have a set schedule and can discuss changes, but he also doesn’t like conflict and wishes I’d “just let it go.” My stance: I offered multiple solutions, bought extra stuff so she’d be comfortable, and I physically can’t handle 78–80°F in the house. Also… utilities are expensive.  AITA for locking the thermostat with a PIN?  Edit for common questions:  - The smart thermostat is set so either of them can request a temp change from their phones or the wall, but it pings me for approval. I’m not saying “no” every time; I’ve approved bumps to 71–72°F a few evenings when it was freezing rain. I just won’t approve 78–80°F as the default.  - We split bills evenly; I offered to switch to a usage-based split for winter if we keep it hotter, and she refused.  - The landlord approved the smart thermostat in writing. He said “as long as the unit works and you don’t damage anything, I don’t care.”  - I’m absolutely open to a house vote on a different schedule. I’m not trying to control; I’m trying to enforce a reasonable, agreed-upon range and cost. subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: Why do so many apartment buildings ban charcoal grills on balconies?\nself_text: I just moved into a new apartment in the US and the lease says “no open flames on balconies/patios,” specifically banning charcoal and propane grills. I get that fires are bad, but what exactly makes a small charcoal grill on a concrete balcony so risky? Is it about embers drifting, the smoke, carbon monoxide, or just insurance/liability?\n\n- Are propane grills usually banned for the same reason, or is charcoal considered worse?\n- Do first-floor patios with lots of open space have different rules?\n- Are electric grills/griddles typically allowed, and are they actually safer under building codes?\n\nCurious what the real reasoning is (fire code, insurance requirements, building materials like vinyl siding, etc.) and if there are any safe/allowed alternatives that still give decent results.\nsubreddit: NoStupidQuestions",
  "title: AITA for refusing to pay my “share” of a surprise birthday dinner I didn’t agree to?\nself_text: I (26F) was added to a group chat last week by a friend-of-a-friend “Ava” (27F) planning a surprise birthday dinner for our mutual friend “Jess” (27F). The plan was to meet at a nice spot downtown, split everything “evenly,” cover Jess’s meal, and then go out after.\n\nI immediately said I could come but my budget for dinner was around $30–$40 before tip/tax, and I don’t drink. Ava replied with a thumbs up, no other discussion.\n\nDay of, we show up and it’s an omakase/small plates place where most things are $20–$30 each and cocktails are $16+. Ava ordered a bunch of shared plates and multiple rounds of cocktails for the table without asking what people wanted. I told the server I’d just have water and ordered one cheap veggie dish for myself because I knew an even split was coming.\n\nWhen the bill came, Ava said it would be “easiest” to split evenly among 8 of us, including Jess’s full meal and drinks. My “share” came to $122. I said I was happy to pay for my dish, tax, tip, and put in extra toward Jess, but I wasn’t comfortable subsidizing multiple cocktails and dishes I didn’t touch after I’d said my budget up front. I calculated $42 total including a generous tip and $15 toward Jess and Venmo’d that.\n\nA few people were cool with it, but two in the group (including Ava) said I was being unfair and “cheap,” that everyone knows birthdays are even splits, and I should’ve “opted out” if I couldn’t swing it. I reminded them I did state my budget and wasn’t told the kind of place or that they’d be ordering rounds for the table. Ava said it was “tacky” to go line-item on a birthday dinner and now she’s short and has to chase others.\n\nNow the group chat is weird, and one friend told me I should apologize and just pay the difference to keep the peace. I feel like I paid my fair share and extra for the birthday girl, and the organizer should’ve been transparent or honored my budget.

  "title: Why do some people leave their cars idling in parking lots for long periods?\nself_text: I often see folks sitting with engines running for 10–30 minutes outside stores or in apartment lots, even when the weather isn’t extreme. Is there a practical reason (battery charging, turbo cooldown, AC/heat efficiency, remote start quirks, etc.), or is it just habit? Also, is idling actually bad for modern engines or mainly just a fuel/emissions issue? Curious what the real pros/cons are and if any laws apply in the U.S.\nsubreddit: NoStupidQuestions",
  "title: AITA for refusing to lend my car to my sister after she left raw chicken and milk to rot in it?\n self_text: I (27F) have a small hatchback that I baby because it’s paid off and I can’t afford a new one right now. My sister “Kay” (24F) doesn’t have a car. We live in the same city but not together. Over the past year I’ve let her borrow my car maybe twice a week for work, errands, etc. The standing rules have always been: ask first, fill it back to where it was, and don’t eat in it.  Two weeks ago, she borrowed it “for 20 minutes” to run to the store. She wound up keeping it for four hours, didn’t respond to texts, and came back with the tank basically on E. When I got in the next morning for my own commute, the smell hit me like a wall. I found a grocery bag in the trunk with raw chicken (leaking), a half gallon of milk (opened, cap loose), and a package of shrimp. It was warm to the touch. I had to be at work, so I did the best I could with wipes and baking soda, but the smell was awful.  I took it to get professionally cleaned the next day: $180 for an interior detail and ozone treatment. Kay apologized by text but said she “got distracted” at a friend’s place, forgot the groceries, and “didn’t think it would be that big of a deal.” I asked her to reimburse the detail and to top off the tank. She sent me $40 and said that’s all she can do right now.  I told her she can’t borrow the car anymore unless she leaves a $100 deposit up front (to be returned when the car is back clean and fueled) and agrees to same-day pickup/drop-off times so I’m not stranded. She got mad, said I’m “holding the car hostage” and punishing her for a mistake. Our mom thinks I’m being dramatic and that “family helps family,” and that I should at least let Kay take it when she needs to work. For context, Kay’s job is on a bus line and she also has a friend who gives her rides, she just prefers using my car because it’s easier.  Extra info:  - Kay has previously returned my car with the low fuel light on and crumbs everywhere despite the no-eating rule.  - She “borrowed” my spare key once without asking while I was at the gym. After that, I started keeping the spare at my place instead of in the house we grew up in.  - I offered to help her budget for Uber/bus or to split a zipcar membership. She declined and said why pay when I have a car.  Now Kay is telling everyone I’m making her life harder over “a smell” and that I’m trying to “profit off family.” I honestly just don’t want my car ruined, and I can’t afford repeated cleanings.

  "title: AITA for locking my pantry after my roommate kept “borrowing” my groceries?\n self_text: I (28F) live with one roommate “Kara” (27F). We split rent and utilities 50/50, but we buy our own groceries. We each have a labeled shelf in the fridge/freezer and a cabinet in the pantry—this was agreed when she moved in.\n\nFrom the start, Kara would ask, “Hey can I use a splash of your olive oil?” or “Just a little vanilla?” I said yes the first few times because it was tiny amounts. Then it turned into her regularly “borrowing” expensive stuff: my extra virgin olive oil, real maple syrup, imported parmesan, baking chocolate, and most recently a brand-new bottle of sesame oil and a small jar of saffron that I bought for a special recipe. When I went to cook, the saffron was basically gone and the sesame oil was half empty.\n\nI asked her (calmly) to stop using my things and suggested:\n- We create a shared staples list (oil, salt, sugar, flour, etc.), split the cost monthly\n- Or she can Venmo me when she uses more than a tiny amount\n- Or we keep things separate and just don’t share food\n\nShe said I was being “weird about food” and that roommates share “within reason.” I pointed out these weren’t cheap basics—she said she can’t afford “fancy” stuff and I should be more understanding.\n\nAfter finding my parmesan replaced with a bag of pre-shredded “Italian blend,” I bought a simple child safety latch and put it on my pantry cabinet. I also started keeping pricier items in a bin in my room when I’m not cooking. Kara flipped. She said it’s “hostile” and made her look bad when her boyfriend was over and she couldn’t “grab some oil to make eggs.” I reminded her the shared staples plan was still on the table if she wants to split a normal bottle of canola or something; she refused and said the lock is “petty.”\n\nThen last week she borrowed my rice cooker without asking and used my rice (from my labeled bin) because “hers was out.” I Venmo requested $6 (approx half the sesame oil + rice she used). She declined and texted that she’s struggling financially and I’m “nickel-and-diming” her instead of being empathetic. I offered to help her pick budget staples and meal prep ideas, or even do a single big Costco run we could split to save her money. She said that was “condescending.”\n\nNow a couple mutual friends say I’m being over the top and should just let the oil/rice stuff go to keep the peace, but I’m tired of budgeting for two. Kara is still mad and says the pantry lock “proves” I don’t see her as family.\n\nAITA for locking my pantry and sending a small Venmo request after repeated “borrowing”?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for asking my sister to reimburse me after she bailed on our shared hotel room for a family wedding?\nself_text: I (29F) booked a hotel room for my cousin’s out-of-town wedding last weekend. Back in August, my sister “Ava” (32F) and I agreed we’d split a room—two queens, two nights, walking distance to the venue. It was non-refundable but cheaper if paid upfront. Total was $486 after taxes/fees. I sent her the link and she texted, “Looks perfect. Book it and I’ll Venmo you my half on payday.” I booked immediately and sent her the receipt.\n\nPayday came and went and she said she was “tight this month” but would send it “next Friday.” Next Friday came and…nothing. I followed up a week before the wedding with a screenshot of her text confirming we’d split it. She read it and didn’t respond.\n\nThe day before we were supposed to check in, Ava called and said she decided to stay with “friends from college” who live about 40 minutes away to “save money and hang out.” She told me I could “just find someone else to split with” or “ask Mom or Dad to use the extra bed.” Our parents stayed at a different (cheaper) place about 25 minutes away and had already booked. None of my cousins were at my hotel.\n\nI said that wasn’t fair because she agreed to the room and the whole point was convenience (close to venue, no driving after drinking, etc.). She told me to “chill” and that I was “going anyway,” so it wasn’t like I’d be out the whole $486 “because of her.” I told her I’d expect her to at least cover her half of the room she agreed to share.\n\nShe didn’t show up to the hotel at all Friday. Saturday afternoon she texted asking if she could come by to “get ready” and use my mirror because her friend’s place “was chaos.” I said fine. She showed up with two friends, used my bathroom, left makeup and hair stuff everywhere, then left for photos. After the reception, she texted at 1:40am asking if she could crash in my room because her friend’s guest room “fell through.” I was already in bed and said I was asleep and not opening the door (I’d put the latch on and honestly felt uncomfortable with her showing up drunk with random people). She replied “wow” and left it at that.\n\nOn Sunday, I sent her a Venmo request for $243 (half). She declined it with the note: “Didn’t stay there.” I sent screenshots of her original agreement. She accused me of “holding money over her head” and said if I “really needed” the cash I should have “asked Mom.” I told her it’s not about Mom bailing me out; it’s about her backing out after committing. She said I was “punishing” her for making a different plan.\n\nOur mom says I should “let it go” because “it’s family” and “weddings are expensive.” Dad thinks Ava should pay something but didn’t want to “take sides.” I’m frustrated because I budgeted for this assuming we’d split, and the only reason I booked non-refundable was because we both agreed ages ago. If she had changed her mind before the cancellation window, I would’ve booked elsewhere or found another roommate.\n\nFor what it’s worth, I did ask two cousins day-of if they had space or wanted to split mine, but everyone was set. I could afford the room, but it ate into what I’d planned for travel the rest of the month. Also, Ava used the room to get ready and left a mess I had to clean so housekeeping could get in.\n\nAITA for sending the payment request and telling her I expect her to reimburse me for half, even though she never physically slept there?\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for refusing to let my sister bring her dog to stay in my no-pets apartment over the holidays?\nself_text: I (27F) live in a small 1BR apartment with a strict no-pets lease. It’s written in bold, and my landlord has made it very clear there’s a $400 fine per incident plus potential eviction if a pet is found in-unit. The only exception is for documented ESAs with paperwork, which I don’t have.\n\nMy sister (24F) is coming into town for 5 days for the holidays. She has a 90lb husky who is sweet but not well trained (jumps, counter-surfs, bolts, chews). Our parents’ place is mid-renovation and not safe for the dog (open drywall, tools everywhere), and every pet-friendly hotel she checked charges hefty fees or requires a deposit she says she can’t afford. She asked if she could “just keep him with me” since “it’s only a few days.” \n\nI said no because:\n- My lease forbids it and I can’t afford fines or risk eviction.\n- My boyfriend (28M) stays over 4–5 nights a week and has asthma. Dog dander triggers him.\n- The dog destroyed baseboards at our parents’ house last year and chewed through a door frame—my place has a carpet I’d be on the hook to replace.\n\nI offered alternatives:\n- I’d split the cost of a pet-friendly Airbnb or hotel with her to make it affordable.\n- I’d come to her hotel each day to walk the dog so she could still spend time with family.\n- I’d help her call local sitters/boarding kennels and even cover the holiday surcharge up to $200.\n- If she wanted, I’d stay at our parents’ place to help with the dog during the day (it’s 20 minutes from me) while she visits.\n\nShe said I’m being rigid and “hate her dog,” and told me to “just hide him—landlords never check.” I reminded her they do surprise inspections (they’ve done one before), and even if they didn’t, I won’t lie on my lease. She blew up in the family group chat about how I’m “choosing my landlord over family.” My mom said “it’s just one weekend” and that I’m “making this harder than it needs to be.” My boyfriend supports me and said he can’t risk an asthma flare, but now I’m the Grinch.\n\nI genuinely want to help, which is why I offered to pay and do the legwork, but I don’t want to risk my housing or my boyfriend’s health.

  "title: AITA for refusing to dog-sit my sister’s “non-shedding” doodle after it wrecked my apartment?\nself_text: I (29F) live alone in a small one-bedroom apartment. My sister “Ava” (32F) has a 1.5-year-old goldendoodle, “Moose.” For months she’s told everyone he’s “non-shedding,” “hypoallergenic,” and “super chill.” I’m mildly allergic to dogs, but I can usually manage with allergy meds if the dog doesn’t shed much.\n\nAva had a work conference out of town and asked me to watch Moose for four days. I said yes on the conditions that: 1) he would be bathed/groomed before coming, 2) he’d come with a crate, 3) she’d bring his food, toys, and a baby gate, 4) I’d only do short walks because I have a back issue, and 5) she’d pay for any damages if something went wrong. She agreed.\n\nDay 1: Moose immediately sprints into my place and goes full zoomies. Within an hour he’d torn at the corner of my rug and started chewing the bottom of my couch (ya girl made a mistake leaving a soft throw blanket draped low—my fault there). I texted Ava and she laughed it off, saying, “He’s just excited! Keep him crated when you can.”\n\nHe shed everywhere. Like, tumbleweeds in the hallway. My air filter turned gray by bedtime and my eyes were on fire. I used lint rollers and vacuumed twice. He also barked at every single hallway noise (thin walls), so my neighbors texted me around midnight asking if everything was OK.\n\nDay 2: I did a longer morning walk to tire him out, used the baby gate to block the bedroom, and crated him when I showered. He howled in the crate like a banshee. When I came out, he’d pawed the tray and bent one corner. Later, while I was on a Zoom call with a client, he found a squeaker toy in his bag and squeaked it like he was getting paid for it. I muted as fast as I could, but my client definitely heard. Moose also peed on the rug (he’s supposedly fully house-trained) and scratched the paint off my front door from jumping when the mail arrived.\n\nDay 3: My allergy meds were barely touching it. I woke up wheezing, which freaked me out because I’ve never had that happen. I texted Ava saying I wasn’t comfortable finishing the sit. I offered to bring him to a doggy day care nearby for the last two days—Ava would just need to call in to approve payment. She refused and told me I was “overreacting” and to “crack a window.”\n\nI told her I was taking Moose back to her house. Her roommate was home, knew I was coming, and let me in. I set Moose up with his food, water, and crate (her roommate was there to watch him), and left. I sent Ava photos, an explanation, and a list of damages: rug corner (not fully destroyed, just frayed), a chewed blanket fringe, and a gouge on the couch leg (wood, cosmetic). I asked her to split the cost of a rug repair/cleaning and a furniture touch-up kit, and to Venmo me for the two extra air filters I had to use because I literally couldn’t breathe (total request about $140). She read it and didn’t respond for hours.\n\nWhen she finally called, she went off on me for “abandoning her dog” and “nickel-and-diming family.” She said Moose is a “baby” and I should’ve “dog-proofed” better, that doodles don’t shed (??), and that I should’ve just dealt with it since it was “only two more days.” She also said the roommate didn’t sign up to watch Moose (he did say it was fine when I arrived). I said I didn’t sign up to risk an asthma attack, and that we agreed on damages beforehand.\n\nNow my mom is involved. She thinks I should’ve powered through, cracked a window, and not asked for money. My dad is on my side and says if your pet damages something, you pay. Ava is still sending snarky texts about how I’m “not a dog person” and that I “couldn’t handle a basic favor.” Our group chat is split.\n\nAITA for ending the sit early and asking my sister to pay part of the damages/filters?

Internet is in my name and we agreed he’d pay half.\n\nWhen he moved in 6 months ago I gave him the Wi‑Fi password. Within a couple weeks our speeds tanked. I logged into the router and saw 20+ devices. Turns out Dan had given the password to his girlfriend (fine), the next-door neighbor “just for a couple days” (not fine), and three of his friends who “hang out here a lot.” He also uses a smart TV, Xbox, and a bunch of smart plugs.\n\nI asked him to stop sharing and offered two solutions:\n- I set up a separate guest network with a simple password for visitors, limited bandwidth.\n- Or we split the cost to upgrade to fiber for more headroom.\n\nHe said I was being “gatekeep-y” about internet, refused to upgrade, and promised he wouldn’t share the password again. I changed the main password and gave it to him after that conversation.\n\nFast forward a week: speeds tank again, router shows a bunch of new devices with names like “John’s iPhone” and “Roku-LivingRoom” I don’t recognize. I confronted him; he denied sharing, then I literally overheard him in the hallway telling the neighbor the new password “because OP is being weird about it.”\n\nSo I:\n- Switched the main network password (again).\n- Turned on MAC filtering for my devices and my work laptop.\n- Set up a guest network with a clear label (APARTMENT_GUEST), reasonable speed cap, and texted Dan: “Use this for your devices and share it with friends if you want. If you need full speed for work, send me your device name/MAC and I’ll add it to the main.”\n\nHe blew up, said I was “controlling” and “punishing” him and that internet should be “community.” I pointed out he doesn’t pay for the neighbors or his friends, I’m the one who gets the overage notices and support calls, and I offered multiple times to either stop sharing or pay to upgrade. He’s now telling our mutual friends I “cut him off from the internet,” which isn’t true—he’s on the guest network and I already whitelisted his work laptop on the main.\n\nAITA for locking down the main network and putting him/guests on a limited guest network after repeated sharing and slowdowns?\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for putting a lock on my pantry after my cousin kept \"tasting\" my ingredients?\nself_text: I (27F) run a small baking side business out of my apartment kitchen (cookies/cakes for coworkers and a couple local cafes). My cousin “Mia” (24F) moved in two months ago after a breakup. We agreed she’d pay reduced rent if she helped with basic chores and respected that some of the food in the kitchen is inventory/ingredients for orders, not communal groceries.\n\nI keep everything labeled. There’s literally a bin that says “COMMUNAL – PLEASE EAT” and then separate labeled bins for “BUSINESS – DO NOT USE.” I also have a shopping list on the fridge where either of us can write stuff we need.\n\nFrom week 1, Mia was “sampling” things: a handful of chocolate chips here, a scoop of peanut butter there, finishing my vanilla paste, using my pastry bags and not washing them properly, and once she cracked open a carton of eggs I’d set aside for a batch due the next morning. Every time I said something, she’d laugh and say “it’s just a taste” or “I’ll replace it.” She would replace some items days later, but the timing mattered because I had deadlines. Twice I had to run out at 11pm to grab replacement butter and sugar when stores were about to close.\n\nThree weeks ago, I sat her down and restated the boundary: if it’s labeled business, don’t touch it—period. I also offered to budget an extra $20 each week from me to stock the communal bin so she wouldn’t feel like she’s “starving” between paychecks. She agreed, apologized, and for a few days it was fine.\n\nLast Tuesday I came home to find my 2lb bag of pecans (about $16) open with a sticky note: “Sorry! They smelled so good lol, I’ll replace soon.” That was the final straw—those were for a paid order due the next morning. I managed to fulfill it, but it set me back, and pecans aren’t cheap.\n\nThe next day I bought a simple latch lock for the pantry cabinet where I keep business ingredients and tools. I gave Mia a heads-up that I’d installed it and reminded her the entire bottom shelf of the other cabinet and the fridge bin are still communal. I also told her if she wants to bake, I’m happy to set aside shared basics (flour/baking powder) but my specialty stuff is off-limits.\n\nMia is furious. She says I’m treating her like a child, “locking up food from family,” and making the apartment “hostile.” She called my mom (her aunt) who texted me that I’m “embarrassing the family” and that it’s “just food.” My mom says if it’s that serious, I should “just buy extra” (I already do) or “plan better” (I literally label and schedule everything). My aunt chimed in that Mia is “going through a lot” and “comfort snacking is normal.”\n\nFor what it’s worth, Mia still has plenty to eat—pantry staples, breakfast stuff, leftovers, frozen meals. I’m not locking the entire kitchen, just the business cabinet. I even offered to unlock it anytime she needs something if she asks first and it isn’t for an order.\n\nMia is now giving me the silent treatment and slamming cabinets dramatically.

I’m first-gen, worked two jobs most semesters, and my parents (who don’t have a lot) and I split costs for a small backyard party with catering and a photographer my cousin is doing at a discount. I’m really excited and honestly pretty proud of myself.\n\nMy sister “Kayla” (28F) is 11 weeks pregnant with her first. I’m happy for her and I’ve kept the secret since she told me at 8 weeks. Last weekend she texted me saying she and her husband want to do a “cute reveal” at my party since “everyone will already be there” and “it’ll be special to share big milestones as a family.” Her plan is to have my cousin (photographer) gather everyone after my dad’s toast and then they’d hand my parents a onesie and announce.\n\nI told her I’d rather she didn’t do a formal announcement at my graduation party. It’s my day and something I’ve worked toward for years, and I don’t want the focus to shift. I offered to help plan a small brunch the following weekend just for a baby announcement, or even set aside a different time during the party week to FaceTime extended family together. I also offered to pay for cupcakes/balloons if she wants to do it then.\n\nShe got upset and said I’m “gatekeeping attention,” that it’s “not that deep,” and it would be “literally 5 minutes.” She also said it makes sense financially to do it at my party because she can use the decorations/photographer and doesn’t want to host twice. My cousin privately said he doesn’t want to be in the middle and will shoot whatever we decide.\n\nMy mom thinks I should “share the day” because “we don’t get many chances to have everyone together,” and she hinted that it might be “bad luck” to wait too long (??). My dad is on my side and told Kayla to plan her own announcement. Now she’s threatening not to come if she can’t announce, and my mom is mad at me for “making drama.”\n\nTo be clear: I told Kayla she can tell people individually if it comes up (my cousins will probably notice she’s not drinking), but I don’t want a planned speech/photos/props taking over the toast portion. I also didn’t tell anyone else the news.\n\nAITA for saying no to the announcement at my party?\n\nEdit for clarity: The party deposit and catering were paid by me and my dad. My mom is handling decorations. The photographer is my cousin doing a $100 family rate, which Kayla specifically mentioned wanting to “take advantage of.” I’m not banning any pregnancy talk; I just don’t want a choreographed reveal with everyone gathered and the mic right after the graduation toast.\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for asking my sister to stop bringing her dog to my apartment without asking?\n self_text: I (28F) live in a small one-bedroom and my sister (31F) recently adopted a very energetic lab mix. I love dogs, but I have mild allergies and my building technically requires pets to be registered with management (mine aren’t). My sister has started “dropping by” with her dog whenever she’s in the area—sometimes texting “on my way!” 5 minutes before she parks.\n\nThe first time, it was fine. The second time, the dog zoomed around, jumped on my couch (left muddy paw prints), and knocked over a small plant. The third time, she came right as I was logging into a work call (I WFH two days a week), and her dog barked at street noise the whole time. I’ve asked her to give me at least a day’s notice and to keep the dog on a short leash in my place, bring a towel, and not let him on furniture. She says I’m being “uptight” and that “he needs socialization” and “this is family.”\n\nI offered alternatives:\n- We meet at a nearby dog-friendly cafe/park.\n- I go to her place instead when I’m free.\n- If she really needs to come over, she asks a day in advance so I can take allergy meds and throw a cover on the couch.\n\nYesterday she dropped by again without asking. I didn’t answer the door (I had my headphones on and a meeting). She blew up my phone saying I was “punishing” her and “hiding.” Later she texted that if I “can’t handle a dog” I’m “not supportive.”\n\nI told her I’m happy to hang out, but she cannot bring the dog to my apartment unless we plan it in advance and agree to some basic rules. Now she’s not speaking to me and my mom says I should “be more flexible because it’s a baby dog.”\n\nAITA for setting this boundary?\n\nEdit: I don’t want her dog banned forever, I just want advance notice and some basic control so I can protect my stuff and not blow up my sinuses during work.\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for putting a lock on my bedroom door after my roommate kept “borrowing” my stuff?\nself_text: I (27F) live in a 3BR with two roommates. One of them, “Lena” (26F), constantly “borrows” things without asking—makeup, hair tools, sweaters, my Bluetooth speaker, even my baking pans. Sometimes items come back dirty or broken, sometimes they don’t come back at all unless I ask.\n\nI’ve brought it up several times, calmly. Each time she apologizes and says she “forgot to text” or thought it was “no big deal.” I tried solutions: labeled what’s communal in the kitchen, made a small basket in the hallway of things I’m fine sharing, and asked her to just shoot a quick text before taking anything from my room.\n\nTwo weeks ago my favorite cardigan went missing for three days and came back stretched out with foundation on the collar. That was kind of the last straw. Our lease allows bedroom privacy locks (landlord-installed thumb turn, not a deadbolt), so I asked the landlord to add one. He did. I told both roommates I was doing it and why, and that I’m still happy to share anything in the communal bin—just not personal items from my room.\n\nFast forward to this weekend: Lena had a wedding to attend and wanted to use my curling iron (which I’ve loaned before). I was out grocery shopping and my door was locked. She called me twice and I didn’t see it until I was checking out. When I got home she was upset, saying I’d “sabotaged” her and that I knew she needed it. She ended up going with straight hair and told me I was being “petty and controlling” by locking “her own house” away from her.\n\nSince then she’s been cold and has told mutual friends I’m “gatekeeping a hair curler.” A couple people are saying I’m being too rigid since “roommates share things.” Our third roommate thinks a lock is fair and that Lena is overreacting.\n\nFor what it’s worth:\n- I did not say she could never borrow it again. I just want her to ask first and return things in the same condition.\n- I’ve replaced or cleaned multiple items she damaged out of my own pocket because I hate conflict.\n- The lock was installed by the landlord and is specifically allowed for privacy/security.\n\nAITA for locking my door and sticking to “ask first” after repeated boundary pushing?\n\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for refusing to give up the extra seat I was holding for my friend at a sold-out movie?\nself_text: i (29m) went to see a sold-out showing of a big release last weekend at a small indie theater that doesn’t do assigned seating. it was general admission: first come, first served. i got there 45 minutes early because i knew it would be packed and grabbed two seats in the middle for me and my friend “jake” (28m). i put my jacket on the seat next to me for him. he was on his way but running about 10–15 minutes behind because of traffic and parking.\n\nabout 10 minutes before showtime a couple came in looking for two seats together and asked if the second seat was taken. i told them i was saving it for my friend who was already on the way. they said it wasn’t fair to save seats at a sold-out show and that i should “be reasonable” and let them sit. i offered them my single seat and said i’d move to the front row or stand in the back when my friend arrived, but they said they wanted those two seats specifically and that “saving seats is rude.” another guy nearby chimed in and said you can’t save seats at a sold-out show. a few other people said it was fine since my friend was actively on the way.\n\ni held the seat. jake showed up maybe 5 minutes after the previews started, apologized to the couple when he squeezed in, and we watched the movie. after the show, the same couple confronted us in the hallway and said i “ruined their night” because they had to sit separately on opposite sides of the theater. i told them i was there early and offered them my spot; i wasn’t trying to hoard space for someone who might not show. they said theater etiquette is “no saving” at sold-out shows, even for a minute.\n\nlater in our group chat, one friend said i was right to hold it because jake was literally in transit and i arrived early for exactly that reason. another friend said i was an AH because “once it’s sold out, all seats are community property,” and if he’d been any later we would’ve wasted a prime seat during previews while people were scrambling.\n\nif it matters: the theater staff didn’t say anything either way, and there were still single seats scattered around before the previews started. jake apologized again for being late and said he’d have sat in the front alone if i’d given up the seat, but i didn’t think it was fair after i waited early.\n\nAITA for keeping the seat for my friend at a sold-out, non-assigned seating show when he was on the way?\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: Is it rude to ask someone to turn off their reading light on a red-eye flight?\n self_text: Curious about airplane etiquette. On overnight/red-eye flights when most people are trying to sleep, is it rude to politely ask a seatmate to turn off their overhead reading light? I use an eye mask but the light still leaks in and makes it hard to sleep. I get that they have every right to use it if they want to read or work, so I don’t want to be entitled. Is there a “right” way to handle this (ask a flight attendant, try to switch seats, just deal with it)? What’s the social norm here?\n subreddit: NoStupidQuestions"
