  "title: Remember when servers felt like small towns? How do we get that vibe back without ditching modern conveniences?\n self_text: I miss that era when your server felt like a neighborhood. People knew the guilds that pugged clean runs, the ninja looters, the clutch healers, the funny shout-chat guy. Cross-realm queues and megaservers fixed a lot of friction, but they also erased reputations and the “we’re in this together” feeling.\n\nCurious what design ideas could bring that back without nuking QoL:\n- Soft “home world” identity: keep fast cross-server queues, but weight matches toward your home world so you run into the same names more often.\n- Public reputation pings: optional endorsements after runs (not just “like,” but tags like “patient teacher,” “shot-caller,” “chill,” visible on profile).\n- Local economies that matter: a portion of trading, crafting orders, or resource spawns tied to your home world so regulars recognize crafters/gatherers.\n- Recurring mentor-apprentice pairings: matchmaking that tries to re-pair you with mentees/mentors you’ve already vibed with.\n- Server-level events and leaderboards: weekly goals, town restorations, or “best helpful player” spotlights voted by players, with small cosmetic rewards.\n- Bulletin boards/hub postings: in-game LFG notes that persist in your city hub so groups can form organically without leaving the game.\n- Neighborhood housing districts: small instanced wards with limited slots so you actually get to know your literal neighbors.\n\nHave any recent MMOs done this well without making queues worse? Would you accept slightly longer waits if it meant you’d regularly see familiar faces again? What’s one social system you’ve seen that actually made your server feel alive?\n subreddit: MMORPG",
  "title: Thinking about swapping from perma-DPS to healer in MMOs—sell me on it\n self_text: I'm a long-time DPS main across MMOs (WoW, FFXIV, GW2) and burnout + queue times have me eyeing healer life, but I'm anxious about being the party's safety net and staring at frames instead of mechanics. For vets who made the switch: what made healing genuinely fun for you (clutch saves, mitigation planning, damage weaving)? Which games/specs feel proactive instead of whack-a-mole, and are beginner-friendly (e.g., Resto Druid vs Disc in WoW, Sage vs Scholar in FFXIV, GW2 supports)? How do you set up UI, mouseover macros, and keybinds to keep awareness high? What low-stress content is best to learn without ruining runs, and how do you deal with blame/toxicity when things go sideways? Any must-have tips, addons, or mindset shifts appreciated—I want to give it a real shot.\n subreddit: MMORPG",
  "title: Are modern MMOs over-smoothing the social edges that made them memorable?\n self_text: I’ve been bouncing between new releases and returning to classics, and I keep feeling like the more we remove social friction (cross-server queues, instant teleports to dungeons, global auction houses, megaservers), the less the game sticks. The risk of needing to talk to someone, remember a name, or travel somewhere used to create stories—and reputations. I’m not advocating for 2005-level tedium; accessibility is great. But which specific systems strike the best balance today? Things like limited-but-meaningful fast travel, server-locked identities/economies, group content that rewards communication over raw ilvl, role interdependence without punishing downtime, and hubs/housing that actually feel like neighborhoods. If you think friction is overrated, what replaced it for you—seasonal goals, cosmetics, or out-of-game social tools? And if you think it’s essential, what modern MMO does it right (OSRS, Classic-era servers, FFXIV with Party Finder, something else)? Curious how the genre can be sticky without being sloggy.\n subreddit: r/MMORPG",
  "title: My cat’s 4AM zoomies are undefeated—how do you re-train sleep schedule without being a monster?\n self_text: I’ve tried scheduled evening play (30–40 min feather wand + laser), a 10pm wet food meal, puzzle feeders at night, Feliway, ignoring the meowing (which turns into door-scratching), and an automatic feeder at 5am to break the “cry = food” loop. She still yodels at 4:07 like clockwork. Apartment walls are thin so I cave—bad human. Any evidence-based tips that actually worked for you? Night routine templates welcome. Also: is a quiet “time-out room” for 10–15 min humane or just reinforcing attention-seeking?\n subreddit: r/cats",
  "title: What MMOs still feel like worlds in 2025? Tired of lobby design and FOMO passes\n self_text: I'm looking for an MMO that feels like a persistent, social world rather than a lobby game. I prefer open-world reasons to explore, meaningful crafting/economy, small-group content that's viable, and progression that doesn't punish missing a week. I've played FFXIV (love the story and community, but endgame loop feels instanced), GW2 (great exploration, but metas can feel zergy), WoW Retail and Classic (Retail feels seasonal treadmill; Classic is fun but I'm ready for something fresh), ESO (love housing, but combat feels floaty to me), and New World (crafting was cool, endgame less so). What current or upcoming MMOs hit that \"living world\" vibe—without heavy battle passes or daily FOMO?

  "title: Why does my 2-year-old indoor cat get the 3 AM zoomies despite lots of evening play?\n self_text: My 2-year-old neutered male, indoor-only, gets wild zoomies around 3 AM—sprinting, chirping, launching off furniture. He gets two 15–20 min wand-toy sessions nightly, last meal ~10 PM, lights out 11:30. Auto-feeder drops a snack at 5 AM; vet check last month was normal. Is this just normal crepuscular behavior, or can I shift his schedule? Would a later, more intense play session + meal help?

  "title: First time fostering a spicy kitten — how do I socialize her without stressing my resident cat?\n self_text: I took in a 10-week-old hissy-but-curious kitten who hides a lot; my 4-year-old resident cat is cautious but not aggressive. I’ve set up a safe room, scent-swapped with blankets, and I’m feeding on opposite sides of the door and doing short play sessions with a wand toy. For those who’ve done this: when did you start cracked-door visual intros, is Feliway actually worth it, and what treats/toys worked best to build trust? Should I ignore her until she approaches or do gentle, frequent interactions? Nighttime tips to reduce crying are welcome, plus any red flags to watch for (e.g., litter box avoidance, food guarding).

  "title: Does anyone else have a bathroom bodyguard cat? How do I curb the door-scratch panic?\n self_text: My 2-year-old indoor rescue has decided that my bathroom time is a team sport. If I close the door, she meows, scratches, and does the dramatic paw-under-the-gap routine until I cave. If I let her in, she sprints to the sink to supervise, tries to drink from the tap, and yells if the shower curtain blocks her view. Door open = calm. Door closed = opera.\n\nShe gets two solid play sessions a day (wand toy + chase), eats on a schedule with a puzzle feeder, has a window perch, and we rotate toys. Otherwise she’s confident and chill—no other separation issues. This feels like bathroom-specific FOMO.\n\nQuestions:\n- Is this just “normal cat” behavior that I should roll with, or a sign of mild separation anxiety?\n- Best training hacks to reduce the scratching/meowing? I was thinking:\n  • Reward calm waiting on a bathmat outside the door (clicker + treats).  \n  • Lick mat or food puzzle outside the bathroom during showers.  \n  • Short “door closed” reps, gradually increasing duration.  \n  • Play session right before shower time to take the edge off.  \n  • Feliway by the bathroom?\n\nWould love success stories or routines that worked for your bathroom bodyguards.

  "title: My cat keeps bringing me socks at 3 a.m.—is this normal?\n self_text: Every night around 3 a.m., my 2-year-old rescue drags socks out of the hamper, piles them on my pillow, and chirps until I acknowledge each \"gift.\" I praise her and put them away, but the wake-up calls are getting earlier. Is this just hunting/show-and-tell behavior? Any tips to redirect it to toys or a better schedule? I already do a late play session with a wand toy and a small snack before bed, which helps a bit, but the sock parade still happens a few nights a week.

  "title: Why is my fried rice still a little mushy even with day-old rice?\n self_text: I’m using jasmine rice: rinse until the water’s mostly clear, cook 2 cups in a rice cooker at about 1:1.1 rice-to-water, fluff, spread on a sheet tray, and chill uncovered in the fridge overnight. Next day I preheat a carbon steel wok on an electric stove until smoking, add avocado oil, aromatics (garlic + scallion whites), push aside, scramble eggs, then add frozen peas/carrots straight from the freezer, then the rice. I season with light soy, a bit of oyster sauce, a touch of sesame oil, and white pepper. It still ends up slightly wet/clumpy and doesn’t get that dry, toasty texture. What should I tweak: rice-to-water ratio (go drier?), cool the rice longer or chill it on a sheet pan even more, thaw and pat dry the frozen veg first, add sauces by drizzling around the hot wok, or just use less sauce? Also, is my electric stove the bottleneck—should I cook in smaller batches or preheat longer? Any tips to get non-sticky, distinct grains would be awesome.\n subreddit: r/AskCulinary",
  "title: Looking for an MMO that feels alive but respects 60-minute sessions—recommendations?\n self_text: Returning player with limited time; I want an MMO with active social hubs, meaningful group content that fits 30–60 minute windows (dungeons, world bosses), progression that isn’t a relentless gear treadmill, and an economy where crafting/gathering matter. Likes: FFXIV (story/world, but MSQ burnout), GW2 (mounts/events, gear chase felt light), ESO (crafting/world good, combat felt floaty), WoW (snappy dungeons, treadmill fatigue). Prefer action-leaning combat with buildcraft; fine with a sub or box price, not fine with aggressive P2W; minimal FOMO; region-flexible servers a plus.

Her pupils get huge, ears forward, tail sometimes quivers and flicks slowly, and she looks super focused. No growling or hissing—just intense stare + chatter.\n\nIs this normal “hunting mode” excitement or a sign she’s frustrated/stressed?

Also, is it okay to let her watch bird videos on TV, or does that make the frustration worse?\n subreddit: r/cats",
  "title: Looking for a modern MMO with old-school social vibes (meaningful crafting, slower leveling, real interdependence)\n self_text: I’m chasing that classic MMO feeling where the world nudges you to talk to people, not just queue for instanced stuff and dip.\n\nWhat I’m hoping to find:\n- Crafting that actually matters to the economy and gearing (not just glamour or a side chore)\n- Slower, more deliberate leveling where you learn your kit and group content isn’t only endgame raids\n- Open-world grouping/social hubs that feel alive, not just lobby tools\n- Guilds that have purpose beyond raid nights (buffs, housing, projects)\n- Minimal FOMO/battle-pass pressure\n\nWhat I’ve bounced off recently: WoW Retail (fast treadmill), GW2 (great world, but zerg-y and crafting felt secondary to me), FFXIV (love the story, but a bit theme-park/instanced for what I want), New World (intriguing economy, endgame loop got same-y), Albion Online (economy is awesome, full-loot PvP isn’t my vibe), OSRS (love it, but I’m craving something fresh).\n\nGames I’m eyeing but don’t know current state: LOTRO, EverQuest (TLP?), Project Gorgon, FFXI (retail), DDO, Classic WoW (SoD/Cata), Elder Scrolls Online with crafting/guild focus, or anything niche I’m missing. Also curious if any newer titles have quietly nailed these pillars without turning into seasonal grind machines.\n\nI’m NA, PC, fine with sub or B2P, prefer PvE or light/opt-in PvP. Not chasing world firsts—just want a community-centric world where trade chat, crafting orders, and spontaneous dungeon runs make the game feel like a place.\n\nIf you’ve got server/faction recommendations or a guild that fits, I’m all ears. What’s your pick in 2025 for that social-sandboxy MMO feel?\n subreddit: MMORPG",
  "title: My new rescue keeps chirping at birds — excited or stressed?\n self_text: Adopted a 2-year-old tabby about 3 weeks ago, and she’s settled in great. The one behavior I’m curious about: whenever she spots birds out the window, she does the little chitter/teeth-chatter “ek-ek-ek” with big pupils and a swishy tail. No hissing or growling, and afterwards she either trills or does zoomies. Eating, using the litter box, and playing normally.\n\nIs this just normal prey-drive excitement, or a sign she’s frustrated/stressed? Should I discourage it or let her watch? Would a window perch and daily wand-toy sessions help channel it? I’m considering putting a feeder outside the window for enrichment—good idea or too tantalizing?\n\nFor context: she gets two 10–15 min play sessions daily (wand toy + kick toy), a couple of puzzle-feeder meals, and plenty of scritch time. Windows are screened and secure, and she has a tall scratching post plus a small cat tree.\n\nWould love tips from seasoned cat people on the best way to make “bird TV” enriching without amping her up too much. Thanks!\n subreddit: cats",
  "title: Looking for an MMO that respects my time (5-8 hrs/week), mostly PvE, hates daily chore FOMO\n self_text: Former WoW/FFXIV player with 5-8 hrs/week looking for an MMO that respects my time: I love group PvE and healing/support, crafting and exploration; I bounce off daily/weekly chores, timegated gear, and battle pass FOMO; prefer horizontal or catch-up-friendly progression, decent LFG that doesn’t require voice every run, NA servers, and no P2W. Recently: WoW keys/vault burned me out, FFXIV roulettes/tome caps feel obligatory, ESO combat didn’t click, Lost Ark/New World felt like chores; I liked GW2’s mounts and horizontal gear but unsure if fractals/raids fit short sessions. In 2025, is GW2 still the best \"log in, do something meaningful, log out\" pick, or are there sleeper MMOs with strong small-group PvE that won’t punish breaks? Server/guild recommendations welcome.\n subreddit: MMORPG",
  "title: Nighttime door yowling from my 2-year-old indoor-only cat—how do I stop the 3am concerts without reinforcing them?\n self_text: My 2-year-old spayed DSH has started yowling outside bedroom/closet doors at ~3am for the past month; vet cleared medical issues, she’s indoor-only, wet food at 7am/7pm, 2 puzzle feeders, fountain, 2 large litter boxes, tall cat tree, and we do 2x15min wand-toy sessions + treat scatter before bed; ignoring escalates volume, and opening the door rewards it; Feliway didn’t help; is this closed-door anxiety vs. schedule/energy, and what’s actually worked—timed feeder at 4–5am, more intense late play, clicker-training a “go to mat and settle,” or quiet overnight enrichment—to reduce the behavior without reinforcing it?\n subreddit: r/CatAdvice",
  "title: Do modern MMOs still support true non-combat mains?\n self_text: I miss systems where non-combat paths were a legit identity, not just side content. In a lot of newer titles, crafting, gathering, trading, logistics, performance, or city roles feel like supplements to the combat treadmill. Are there current MMOs where you can main as a crafter/gatherer/trader/hauler/entertainer/politician and be both endgame-relevant and socially valued without having to grind combat? Concrete examples appreciated: e.g., can someone thrive in EVE purely on industry/market/hauling? In FFXIV, is a DoH/DoL main viable long-term without touching combat content? Any modern sandboxes with robust player-run settlements that truly need builders, mayors, or infrastructural roles? Also curious how devs keep these loops profitable while fighting bots/RMT. Looking for games to try and design philosophies that make non-combat mains meaningful again.\n subreddit: r/MMORPG",
  "title: MMO burnout is real—how do you rekindle that “first MMO” spark?\n self_text: I’ve been hopping between MMOs for months and nothing sticks. I’ve done the rounds—FFXIV (caught up, great story but the theme-park loop lost me), GW2 (love the combat, but metas/raids feel like appointments), ESO (solid quests, combat never fully clicked), New World (crafting rules, endgame loop felt samey), Lost Ark (daily chore treadmill), and dipped back into WoW Classic/retail only to bounce again.\n\nWhat actually helped you fall back in love with the genre? Was it a specific game, a guild, or changing how you play?\n\nI’ve got ~8–10 hours/week. I enjoy:\n- Small-group dungeons/strikes\n- Crafting and player-driven economies\n- Open-world PvE with some danger\n- Light RP and chill social vibes\n\nI don’t enjoy:\n- Heavy daily/FOMO checklists\n- Hard gear treadmill or sweaty parses\n- Content that requires strict raid schedules\n\nGames I’m considering giving a real shot: Albion Online (economy/sandbox), Project Gorgon (quirky systems), LotRO (cozy vibes), Old School RuneScape (nostalgia done right), maybe EVE if it’s playable casually. If you have server/data center/guild recs that fit the above, I’m all ears.\n\nAlso open to non-game tips: self-imposed goals, no-DPS-meter runs, joining newbie-friendly guilds, weekly “adventure nights,” or ignoring dailies entirely.

  "title: Introducing a second cat—when do I ditch the baby gate for supervised mingles?\n self_text: Day 5 of slow intro here: scent and site swaps, mealtimes on opposite sides of the door, baby gate with a blanket drape. Resident cat is 4yo neutered male (confident, chill). Newcomer is 2yo spayed female (curious, mildly spicy). Through the gate they do nose touches, tails mostly up, soft blinks, and occasional low growls from her if he rushes. No puffing, pinning, or prolonged staring. They’ll play-bat a wand together across the gate, eat within a foot of each other, and nap near the barrier. I’ve got 3 litter boxes, doubled resources, added vertical space, and I’m clicking/treating calm body language. What concrete green flags tell you it’s safe to move to short supervised sessions without the gate? Is a little hissing on first contact normal, or should I wait for basically zero vocalizations? How long should first sessions be (5–10 mins?), and do you end on a treat-and-separate note even if it’s going great? Bonus: tips to keep zoomie-chasing from turning into a spat. Using Feliway and puzzle feeders. Both vaccinated, negative on tests. Thanks!\n subreddit: r/cats",
  "title: My cat holds 3am hallway concerts—how do I get her to retire?\n self_text: Indoor-only, 2 y/o spayed female, healthy per recent vet check. She’s sweet all day, but around 3am she plants herself in the hallway and yowls like she’s narrating the void. We do two 15–20 min play sessions (wand toy + fetch), feed before bed with a puzzle feeder, and I try to ignore the yowling so I don’t reinforce it. Litter box is clean, no changes in routine, no outside cats visible. I’ve tried Feliway and shifting her last meal later—still gets the midnight yellies. Any tricks that worked for your vocal night owls? More late-night play? Nightlight/white noise? Should I move her food puzzle to the hall? I’m fine with zoomies; it’s the operatic solos I’m trying to curb. Thanks!\n subreddit: r/cats",

I’m into PvE, open-world exploration, crafting/gathering, and 30–90 minute session content; not big on hardcore raiding or full-loot PvP.

  "title: Looking for a chill 2025 MMO with low FOMO and good solo-to-group progression\n self_text: I’m a returning player who bounced between WoW and GW2 years ago. These days I want something I can play 5–8 hours a week without feeling punished by time-gates or battle pass grind. Ideal: active NA population, story I can actually follow, engaging dungeons with reasonable matchmaking, crafting that matters, and a community that doesn’t roast you for learning. Not trying to sweat raids every night, but I do want a path from solo leveling into small-group/endgame that feels natural. What would you recommend in 2025—FFXIV, ESO, GW2, Retail or Classic WoW, or something newer like Blue Protocol or Throne & Liberty?

  "title: Is it normal for my cat to yowl and zoom after using the litter box?\n self_text: 2 y/o indoor male, neutered. Healthy per vet in June. Two boxes, unscented clumping litter, scooped daily. About half the time after pooping he yowls loudly then sprints laps for 30-60 seconds. Poops look normal. No straining, no blood, eats and plays fine.

  "title: Do slower, social-first MMOs still have a shot in 2025?\n self_text: I keep bouncing between modern theme parks but miss the slower, social vibe from older MMOs—open-world grouping without teleport queues, camp-style grinding that encourages chatting, crafters that matter past week one, even a little downtime that gives space to talk; is there still an audience for a game that leans into social interdependence, travel, and community tools over instant matchmaking, and if so what quality-of-life features would you keep so it feels respectful of time without killing the social glue; also, what current or upcoming MMOs scratch this itch?\n subreddit: MMORPG",
  "title: Looking for a social-first MMO in 2025 that doesn’t feel like a second job\n self_text: I’m craving an MMO that prioritizes community and chill play over mandatory dailies and FOMO. I’ve played FFXIV, WoW (retail and classic), ESO, GW2, New World, Albion, RuneScape, and BDO. I love player-driven economies, housing, casual-friendly group content, and real social hubs; I dislike daily chore lists, raid-logging pressure, and battle passes. Is there anything currently thriving that nails social tools (proximity chat, player events, roleplay spots), crafting depth, and optional endgame without punishing me for skipping a week?

  "title: Why does my indoor cat \"chatter\" at birds—excited or frustrated?\n self_text: My 3-year-old indoor-only DSH has a window perch and every time birds land on the balcony she does the rapid teeth-chatter/cheep-cheep chirps with tail twitching and huge pupils. It looks adorable but I’m wondering: is this a normal predatory reflex or a sign of frustration/stress? She eats, plays, and naps normally; no drooling, no dental issues per last vet visit.
