  "title: Boyfriend still texting his ex late at night — is this a fair boundary or am I being controlling?\n self_text: Me (27F) and my boyfriend (29M) have been together 10 months (official for 7). He dated his ex for ~4 years and they broke up about 18 months before we met. They don’t share kids, but they do still occasionally text about mutual friends and “life updates.”  My issue: the messages are often late (like 11pm–1am) and sometimes while we’re on the couch together. He’ll turn his phone face down and says it’s just habit. I’ve seen a couple of their DMs when he was scrolling — nothing obviously flirty, but things like “proud of you” and inside jokes. He’s not hiding his phone from me, but the timing/volume makes me uncomfortable.  I’ve asked him to keep convos to daytime and stick to necessary topics. He said he’d try but it keeps happening every few weeks. He insists it’s platonic and that he doesn’t want to be “weird” about staying friendly with someone who was important to him. When I bring up boundaries, he says I’m trying to control who he talks to.  I don’t want to police him, but late-night one-on-one chats with an ex feel disrespectful. I’m not asking for passwords or for him to cut contact entirely — just:  • no late-night texting with her  • keep it minimal/necessary  • if it starts drifting into personal life/deep stuff, shut it down or move it to daytime  Are these boundaries reasonable? How do I bring this up in a way that isn’t an ultimatum, but also doesn’t leave me stewing in resentment? Has anyone navigated something similar successfully?  TL;DR: BF still texts his ex, often late at night. Not overtly flirty, but it makes me uncomfortable. I’ve asked for daytime/minimal contact and it hasn’t stuck. Are my boundaries fair, and how do I communicate them without coming off controlling?\n subreddit: relationship_advice",
  "title: Boyfriend still won’t introduce me to his friends after a year together\n self_text: Me (25F) and my boyfriend (27M) have been together 13 months. I’ve met his parents, siblings, even a few cousins. But I haven’t met a single one of his friends. He has a pretty tight friend group (college + work) and they hang out multiple times a week. I see the pics on his Instagram stories, group trips, birthdays, random game nights. When I bring it up, he says he “keeps worlds separate” because mixing friends and relationships “caused drama” with his ex.  A few times he’s floated a “maybe you can come this weekend?” and then day-of it turns into “plans changed, it’s just the guys.” He’s also bailed on things with me to go when they text last minute. When he’s with them, he basically goes offline and won’t text back for hours, sometimes the whole night or weekend.  I’ve tried to be super low pressure. I suggested a quick brunch, or just dropping by for a drink to say hi. I don’t need to be at every hang, I just want to meet the people he spends so much time with. He keeps saying “soon.” He insists he’s not hiding me and that he’s just protecting his peace, but after a year it’s starting to feel… off.  For what it’s worth, I’ve introduced him to my friends and he gets along with them fine. He’s great to me in other ways—shows up for family stuff, we do holidays together, he’s affectionate and consistent—this is really the one thing that keeps nagging me.  Is this a reasonable boundary on his part or a red flag? How do I bring this up in a way that doesn’t sound controlling, but is clear that it matters to me? At what point do I set a hard line?  TL;DR: Together 13 months, I’ve met his family but he won’t introduce me to any of his friends and keeps “worlds separate.” Says it’s to avoid drama. I feel hidden and excluded. Is this a boundary or a red flag, and how do I address it?\n subreddit: relationships",
  "title: My girlfriend wants me to cut off my long-time female friend. Am I being unfair?\nself_text: Me (27M) and my girlfriend (26F) have been together for 8 months. Before we met, I’ve been close friends with “Lena” (28F) for almost a decade. We met in college, dated other people, and never had anything romantic between us. She’s basically family to me at this point.\n\nMy girlfriend has never loved that I’m close with a woman, but it came to a head a few weeks ago. Lena came over to watch a game, we cooked, had a couple drinks, and she ended up staying late. We fell asleep on the couch watching a movie. Nothing happened, but my girlfriend found out (I told her, because I didn’t think I had anything to hide) and she was really upset. She said it crossed a boundary, which I understand in hindsight.\n\nSince then, my girlfriend has asked me to stop hanging out with Lena one-on-one and only see her in group settings. I agreed to try that because I get why falling asleep like that looks bad. But now she’s also told me she wants me to stop texting Lena “casually.” She scrolled through a couple memes/jokes we shared and said it felt like emotional cheating. She wants me to only message Lena in a group chat or about “logistics.”\n\nI don’t want to lose my girlfriend over this, and I don’t want to lose a friend who’s been in my life for years. I’ve introduced them multiple times — it’s cordial but not warm. I’ve been transparent, offered to include my girlfriend in plans, share context if she’s ever uncomfortable, etc. She says this is about respect and that if the roles were reversed, I’d feel the same. (For the record, she has a close male coworker she gets coffee with sometimes, and it doesn’t bother me as long as I know what’s up.)\n\nI tried telling Lena we should scale back one-on-one hangs, and she said she gets it but also seemed really hurt and distant after. Now I feel like I’m messing up both relationships. I don’t want to be controlling or secretive, but I also don’t want to cut off a platonic friend to prove something.\n\nWhat are reasonable boundaries here? Is only group hangs and less frequent texting fair, or is that basically a slow fade? Should I push for the three of us to spend more time together so my girlfriend can feel more comfortable, or is this just incompatibility in how we do friendships? I genuinely don’t know what the healthy middle looks like.\n\nTL;DR: Been friends with a woman for ~10 years. Newish girlfriend is uncomfortable, especially after friend stayed late and we fell asleep on the couch (nothing happened). Girlfriend wants no one-on-one hangs and minimal texting. I want to respect my relationship without losing a long-term platonic friend. What’s a fair compromise?\nsubreddit: relationship_advice",
  "title: My boyfriend asked to “open up” our relationship “just to try it” and I feel sick. What do I do?\n self_text: Me (27F) and my boyfriend (29M) have been together almost 3 years, living together for a little over one. The relationship has been stable and loving overall — normal ups and downs, good communication, shared finances, pets, all that. We were always explicitly monogamous.  A couple weeks ago he brought up the idea of “opening things up for a bit to explore.” He said it very casual, like trying a new restaurant: that he’s curious about experiences he “missed” in his early 20s, and that it’s “just sex,” no feelings, and that he’d be totally honest and transparent with me. He also said he still wants me to be his primary person, live together, plan our future, etc. For context, he’s recently gotten closer to a new friend group with a few poly/open couples and he’s been talking a lot about how “free” and “honest” they seem.  I told him I’m not comfortable with that. I’m monogamous. I don’t judge anyone for being open, but it’s not for me and it never has been. He said he “respects that,” but then followed up with, “Can you at least think about it? We could try it for a few months and reassess.”  Since then I feel anxious and honestly a bit betrayed. I can’t un-hear that he wants to sleep with other people. It’s made me question everything: Is this a phase because of his new friends? Is this the beginning of the end? If I say no (which I want to), am I being controlling? If I say yes, I know I’ll be miserable and resentful. I also don’t believe you can “try” opening up and then just go back like nothing happened.  He hasn’t pushed it since, but I know it’s coming back up. I want to be really clear and calm about my boundary without turning it into a screaming match or an ultimatum (even though it kind of is one).  Questions:  - Is it fair to say monogamy is a non-negotiable for me and if he needs non-monogamy, we should break up kindly and respectfully?  - Can relationships actually go back to normal after “trying” openness if one partner never wanted it?  - How do I communicate this without sounding like I’m punishing him for asking?  TL;DR: Boyfriend of 3 years asked to open our relationship “just to try it.” I’m monogamous and don’t want to. How do I set this boundary and what does this mean for us?\n subreddit: relationship_advice",
  "title: Moving to my BF’s city but he wants to keep living with his female roommate/best friend for “one more year.” Reasonable or a red flag?\nself_text: I (26F) have been long-distance with my boyfriend (27M) for a year. I got a job in his city and planned to move in January. We’ve talked a lot about living together and were casually looking at 1-bedrooms… until this week when he told me he wants to renew his lease with his current roommate for “one more year.”\n\nHis roommate is his best friend (28F). They’ve lived together for 3 years, say there’s never been anything romantic, and I’ve met her—she was kind and welcoming. They split chores, cook together a few nights a week, and watch shows. It’s definitely a close friendship. He says rent is way cheaper with her, they’re in a great location, and he “doesn’t want to leave her hanging” while she finishes grad school.\n\nHis “compromise” is that I can “basically stay over most nights” and we’ll treat his room as “our space,” but I’d still be a guest and keep most of my stuff elsewhere. I told him that doesn’t feel like building a life together—it feels like I’m orbiting around their established home. He thinks I’m being controlling/jealous and says I should trust him. For what it’s worth, there’s been no cheating. The only thing that made me pause was learning (after I asked) that she sometimes hangs out in his room to chat if the living room is a mess. He didn’t think that was a big deal; I do.\n\nI’m not trying to force him to ditch a friend or leave someone scrambling for housing. But from my perspective, this was the natural next step for us, and now I feel like I’m Plan B to their living situation. I suggested:\n- We find a place together and help her sublet or find a replacement roommate.\n- We both get separate apartments for a year and reassess.\n- If he truly needs to renew, we set clear boundaries (e.g., no hanging out in bedrooms, scheduled “us” nights at his place, my belongings have space, etc.) and a firm timeline to move in together.\n\nHe says the first two are “overkill” and the boundaries feel “weirdly formal.”\n\nAm I overreacting? Is it reasonable to want to prioritize living together when I’m uprooting my life to be there? If we don’t live together, what boundaries make sense so I don’t feel like a third wheel in their home? Also, if we do agree to a timeline, what’s a fair way to hold each other to it?\n\nTL;DR: Moving to BF’s city expecting to live together; he now wants to renew his lease with his female best friend/roommate for a year. He wants me to “basically stay over” instead. I’m uncomfortable being a guest in their home and want advice on whether this is reasonable, what boundaries to set, or if I should push for separate apartments until we’re aligned.\nsubreddit: relationship_advice",
  "title: My boyfriend hides his phone whenever I walk into the room — am I overthinking?\n self_text: I (27F) have been with my boyfriend (29M) for a little over 3 years, living together for 1. He’s always been pretty relaxed about his phone — lots of meme sharing, random TikToks, asking me to reply to his mom for him, etc. In the last few months that’s changed and it’s messing with my head.\n\n- He keeps his phone face-down 24/7 and turned off message previews.\n- Takes it with him everywhere, even for a 2-minute trip to the bathroom.\n- Changed his passcode (I never asked for it, but it’s noticeable because Face ID used to be enough).\n- If I sit down next to him on the couch, he’ll suddenly close whatever he’s on.\n- Says “Do Not Disturb” helps him focus, but he used to be fine without it.\n- He’s also been staying late at work more often (new project, apparently).\n\nThere is history: two years ago I found flirty messages with a coworker. He swore it never got physical, apologized, and we did couples counseling for a bit. Things were solid after that, which is why this shift feels… familiar.\n\nI brought it up calmly and told him I’m feeling anxious and need reassurance. He said I’m being controlling and that “privacy isn’t the same as secrecy.” I agree in theory — I don’t want to snoop — but the combo of behavior changes + our past is hard to ignore.\n\nI’m not trying to demand passwords, but what’s a reasonable boundary here? Is it fair to ask for transparency (e.g., agreeing to answer questions honestly about who he’s talking to) or is that a slippery slope? If he refuses any reassurance beyond “trust me,” is that my answer?\n\nTL;DR: Boyfriend suddenly got very protective of his phone after past flirty texting incident years ago. I’m spiraling. How do I address this without accusing, and what’s a healthy boundary to ask for?\n subreddit: relationship_advice",
  "title: Boyfriend keeps his phone on DND and face down lately—how do I set reasonable boundaries without being controlling?\n self_text: Me (27F) and my boyfriend (29M) have been together 3 years, living together for 1. He’s always valued privacy, which I respect, but lately it’s shifted into secrecy and it’s messing with my head.\n\nIn the last couple months he:\n- keeps his phone face down or in his pocket even at home\n- turned on Do Not Disturb overnight\n- changed his phone passcode twice (said it was for “work security”)\n- takes his phone to the bathroom/shower\n\nI wasn’t snooping, but while I was using his phone to order food, a muted thread popped up from a female coworker at 12:47 AM (nothing explicit in the preview, just a meme). He said they send each other random stuff sometimes and I’m “overreacting.” He insists he’s not cheating, just wants “some privacy.”\n\nI get that privacy ≠ secrecy, but I’m struggling to draw the line. I don’t want to police his phone or be controlling. I do want to feel safe and not like I’m getting crumbs of information.\n\nWhat are reasonable, healthy boundaries here? I was thinking:\n- agreeing no non-urgent texting with coworkers late at night\n- being upfront about close opposite-sex friendships and meeting those people if they’re significant in each other’s lives\n- talking through why DND is on and finding a setting that still lets us reach each other\n\nHow do I bring this up without it turning into “you’re paranoid”? What wording has worked for you to set expectations while staying respectful?\n\nTL;DR: His phone habits changed and I’m anxious. Want to set mutual, reasonable boundaries without being controlling.

  "title: Am I overreacting that my boyfriend won’t post/acknowledge me after 2 years?\n self_text: I’m 25F, he’s 27M. We’ve been together a little over 2 years, we don’t live together but sleep over most nights, met each other’s families and close friends, do holidays, trips, all the normal couple stuff. Day-to-day we’re good. He treats me well, we laugh a lot, we communicate pretty decently… except for this one thing that keeps eating at me.\n\nHe never acknowledges me on social media. Like, at all. He’s very online—posts his gym pics, his coffee, his dog, memes, his friends at parties, his new shoes, even old throwbacks. His ex is still tagged in a couple old posts (not couple-y, but still there). When I’ve brought it up, he says he’s “private about relationships” and doesn’t want to “invite strangers into our business” or “jinx it.” Totally fair in theory, except he posts literally everything else. He’s also tagged in events where there are girls in photos (group shots, nothing scandalous), but he’ll call those “boys’ nights” when I ask. It makes me feel weird, even if I trust him.\n\nI’m not asking for a hard launch slideshow with Coldplay lyrics. I’d honestly be fine with a random story of us at a concert, or a birthday shoutout, or just not erasing me completely. He offered a compromise of posting me on “close friends” but not on his main, which just made me feel more like a secret.\n\nOther context that bugs me:\n- He doesn’t always bring me to work or hobby events (says it’s boring or “just the team”), then I’ll see a group photo with SOs there.\n- He muted notifications from me during “focus hours” and forgot to unmute, which felt crappy when I saw him replying to comments on his posts during that time.\n- He says “I don’t owe the internet anything,” which I agree with, but social media clearly matters to him in other ways.\n\nI’m trying to check myself because I know social media isn’t the relationship. But I can’t shake the feeling that I’m being kept compartmentalized. I’ve tried to explain it’s not about attention, it’s about feeling claimed/acknowledged in the same space he shares the rest of his life.\n\nAm I being unreasonable? Is this a legit concern or just insecurity? How do I bring it up in a way that doesn’t sound controlling? What’s a fair boundary/compromise here?\n\nTL;DR: Together 2+ years, he posts everything but won’t post/acknowledge me at all and sometimes describes mixed-gender events as “boys’ nights.” Says it’s about privacy/“jinxing.” I feel like a secret.

  "title: My boyfriend keeps canceling plans last minute but insists he wants commitment. What do I do?\n self_text: I (27F) have been dating my boyfriend (29M) for 8 months. He’s sweet, affectionate, talks about a future, introduced me to two of his close friends… but he cancels plans a LOT, usually within a few hours of meeting, and then floods me with “I miss you/you’re my person” texts after.  Examples:  - He canceled a concert we’d been excited about the afternoon of, said he was “fried from work,” then posted hanging with friends the next day.  - He bailed on meeting my sister (planned for 2 weeks) because of “anxiety,” then asked to FaceTime that night like nothing happened.  - He’s also late a ton (30–40 minutes) and brushes it off as “my time blindness is bad” but says he’s working on it.  He says he’s anxious-avoidant, hates phone calls, prefers texting, and that making plans too far ahead stresses him out. I’ve tried to meet him halfway:  - I asked for one solid plan a week that we both commit to.  - If he needs to cancel, please do it at least 24 hours ahead unless it’s a real emergency.  - If he cancels day-of, I won’t rush to reschedule—he can initiate when he’s ready.  He agreed… and then slipped back into patterns. When I mirror his energy and don’t chase, he panics and love-bombs (“I don’t want to lose you”), but the follow-through still isn’t there.  I don’t want to be controlling; I just need reliability. I genuinely like him, but I don’t want to be someone’s backup plan or emotional support with no consistency.  Is this salvageable, or is this just who he is? What’s a reasonable boundary + consequence here (e.g., “If you cancel within 24 hours without a legit emergency, I won’t reschedule that week”)? Is that unfair? At what point do I cut my losses?  TL;DR: Great connection but chronic last-minute cancellations. He says it’s anxiety/avoidance; I need consistency.

  "title: My boyfriend (28M) never introduces me as his girlfriend and it makes me feel invisible\n self_text: I’m 27F and my boyfriend is 28M. We’ve been together a year and a half, we don’t live together but spend most weekends together. When it’s just us, he’s great—thoughtful, consistent, says he loves me, plans time together. The problem is how he acts around other people.\n\nHe never introduces me as his girlfriend. It’s always “This is [my name]” and then he moves on. It’s happened with his coworkers at a work happy hour, with his friends at a game night, and even at a family BBQ where I met his aunt and cousins for the first time. I wasn’t expecting a speech or PDA, just “this is my girlfriend [name].” When I brought it up, he said labels are “cringe” and “performative” and that people can figure it out.\n\nContext that might matter: his last relationship ended messy and he says he hates social media/labels because of that. He doesn’t post much and I don’t need that—this is more about real-life introductions and clarity. A woman at his work event kept flirting with him until I finally said “I’m his girlfriend” and then she backed off. He got weird with me after and said I made it awkward.\n\nI’ve tried to explain that I feel like a secret or a “plus one” instead of a partner when he avoids the word. He says I’m being insecure and that what we have privately matters more than what we call it in public. I hear him, but it still hurts and makes me question if he’s keeping doors open or just unwilling to claim the relationship.\n\nIs this a reasonable boundary to set? How do I bring this up again without it turning into “you’re insecure”? If he still refuses after I explain how it makes me feel, is that a red flag big enough to reconsider the relationship?\n\nTL;DR: Boyfriend won’t introduce me as his girlfriend to friends/family/coworkers, says labels are cringe and people can “figure it out.” I feel sidelined and want to set a boundary, not sure if I’m making a big deal out of nothing.\n subreddit: relationship_advice",
  "title: My boyfriend keeps canceling plans last minute and I’m starting to resent it\n self_text: Me (27F) and my boyfriend (29M) have been together 11 months. He’s sweet and attentive when we’re together, but he cancels plans same-day way too often. It’s usually “work ran late” or “I’m exhausted” and then I’ll see he’s still up gaming or he’ll grab drinks with coworkers “for one” that turns into a night out.  Examples: - Canceled our anniversary dinner an hour before because of a “work emergency,” but posted a story later laughing at a bar with his team. - Twice in the last month he bailed on plans we made a week in advance, but kept plans the same weekend with friends. - He’ll reschedule with me, but it’s always “let’s play it by ear” and the rescheduled plan is something low effort at my place.  I’ve brought it up calmly three times. He apologizes, says I’m a priority, promises to do better… and it happens again within a couple weeks. I don’t want to be controlling, but I feel like an afterthought and I’m starting to dread making plans because I’m bracing for the text.  I’m considering setting a boundary like: “No more same-day cancellations unless it’s truly an emergency. If you cancel, you plan and confirm the next date.” Is that reasonable? How do I frame this without sounding like I’m issuing ultimatums? And at what point is this just incompatibility and I should stop trying?  For context: We don’t live together, both full-time jobs, similar friend/social lives. He’s reliable in other ways (checks in, helps if I ask, remembers things I say), but follow-through on plans is consistently bad.  I love him, but I’m tired of feeling like I get the leftovers.

We’re exclusive, spend most weekends together, have keys to each other’s places, and we’ve talked about future plans like a trip next spring. On paper, it feels like a real relationship.\n\nBut when we’re around other people, he just introduces me by my first name. No “girlfriend,” no “partner,” just “this is [my name].” The first couple times it happened (at a coworker’s party and then again at a friend’s game night) I brushed it off. He said he’s a private person and hates putting labels on things because “labels cause drama.” I don’t need a social media post or matching pajamas, I just don’t want to feel like I’m being hidden.\n\nA few more things that are getting to me:\n- He hasn’t posted me on social media. I don’t need a hard launch, but he posts his friends and dog constantly. He says he keeps his dating life offline.\n- I met his family once and he introduced me to his mom as “my friend from work” (we do not work together—I met him on an app). He later said it was because his mom is “nosy” and would make a big deal of it.\n- I found out his dating app was still “active” (he swears he doesn’t use it and just “forgot to delete.” He did delete it when I brought it up, but it left a bad taste in my mouth.)\n\nI’ve tried to explain that this makes me feel like a placeholder or a secret.

  "title: She moved in “temporarily” 8 months ago and still won’t be on the lease or split bills. How do I set boundaries without blowing this up?\n self_text: M29, F27. Together a little over 2 years. I’ve had my 1BR for 4 years. About 8 months ago my girlfriend started staying over 3–4 nights a week, then basically never left. Most of her clothes, toiletries, and even her work laptop live here now. She still keeps her mailing address at her parents’ place because of “insurance and DMV stuff.”  The issue: she’s not on the lease, doesn’t pay a set amount toward rent or utilities, and any time I bring it up she says she’ll “cover groceries” to even it out. Sometimes she does, sometimes it’s a coffee run and a few snacks. Meanwhile my electric/water went up noticeably, I upgraded internet because we both WFH some days, and I’m footing all of it.  I’ve asked twice (calmly) about adding her to the lease and setting a monthly split for bills. She says “I don’t want to be stuck if we fight” and “it’s your place, I don’t want to take it over.” I get the fear, but it’s starting to feel like I’m a landlord/ATM while she gets all the benefits of living together with none of the responsibility. I’m also worried about the legal side if something went south since she’s effectively living here.  For context, I do want a future with her. I’ve even thought about proposing in the next year. But this is creating resentment I don’t want to carry into anything long-term. Chores are fine (we split cooking/cleaning pretty evenly), it’s really the money/commitment piece.  How do I set a clear, fair boundary without it turning into “you’re pressuring me to move in”? I’m thinking:  - Put a date on it: by lease renewal (in 3 months) she either goes on the lease and we agree on a fixed monthly amount OR she goes back to a few nights a week.  - If she truly doesn’t want to be on the lease, then it’s not a move-in and we treat it like that (no keys left with her, sleepovers limited, groceries/laundry at her place, etc.).  - Write out a simple budget (rent % + utilities split) and ask for a yes/no by a certain date.  Scripts, framing advice, and any legal/logistical gotchas are appreciated. I’m trying to be fair and not make it a character attack, but I also need to stop feeling taken advantage of in my own home.  TL;DR: GF gradually moved in, won’t be on the lease or split bills beyond “I’ll grab groceries sometimes.” Want to set a deadline and clear terms without blowing up the relationship.

  "title: No-kids wedding is turning into family drama—hold the boundary or compromise?\n self_text: My fiancé (29M) and I (28F) are getting married in May. From the start we decided on an adults-only wedding for a few reasons: our venue is small (fire code max is 110), our budget is tight, and the space has lots of candles/glass that make it not super safe for little ones. We put “Adult-only celebration, please” on the invites and reiterated it on our website with a friendly note and local babysitter recommendations a friend shared.  My sister (31F) has three kids under 6 and is furious. She says we’re “excluding family,” claims she can’t find childcare, and threatened not to come if her kids aren’t invited. My parents are now pressuring me to “be flexible for immediate family” and to at least allow “quiet kids and infants.” Meanwhile a cousin already texted “don’t worry, our baby is super chill—we’ll tuck him in a corner.”  I’ve tried to be accommodating without changing the rule: I offered to pay for a vetted sitter to watch my sister’s kids at their Airbnb (or even a hotel room on-site during the reception), set up a private room at the venue for nursing if anyone needs to step away (during cocktail hour only—there isn’t space during dinner), and said we’d FaceTime the kids while getting ready. Sister still says no.  I’m torn between holding the boundary (which we set for real logistical reasons, not to be mean) and caving to keep the peace. I’m also worried about people showing up day-of with kids and making the venue staff the bad guys.  Questions: 1) How do I phrase a final, kind-but-firm message to my sister and parents that we’re not making exceptions? 2) What’s the best way to enforce this day-of without creating a scene (escort cards only for adults? a note at the door? have planner handle)? 3) Is it reasonable to offer to cover childcare for my sister but not for all guests?

I’ve gained maybe 10–15 lbs over the last year after a surgery + work stress.

If I ask him to stop, he says I’m being too sensitive and that he’s “motivating” me or “just joking like everyone in his family does.”\n\nI’ve told him clearly (more than once) this is not funny to me, it makes me self-conscious, and I don’t want comments on my body. He apologizes in the moment and then does it again days later. It gets worse if he’s been drinking. Last week at a friend’s dinner, he made a comment about me “earning dessert,” I went quiet, and later he told me I “killed the vibe” and should learn to take a joke.\n\nI don’t want to break up over this, but I’m honestly starting to resent him and avoid social stuff because I’m bracing for the next jab. I’ve suggested therapy (solo or couples) and he said that’s “dramatic.” I’m prepared to set a hard boundary with consequences, but I don’t want it to turn into a massive blow-up or power struggle.\n\nLooking for advice on:\n- How to communicate this so it actually lands (scripts welcome)\n- Reasonable consequences if he crosses the line again\n- Whether I should step back from events where he drinks until he proves he can stop\n- If this is a bigger respect issue I’m minimizing\n\nI love him, and outside of this he’s generally kind and supportive. But I feel small and humiliated when he does this, and I’m tired of being told my feelings are the problem.\nsubreddit: relationship_advice",
  "title: Moved in 3 months ago and my boyfriend still hasn’t unpacked a single box\nself_text: I (27F) moved in with my boyfriend (28M) three months ago and he still has 10+ boxes stacked in our living room and bedroom. I’ve unpacked all of mine, built furniture, set up the kitchen, bathroom, etc. He keeps saying he’ll “get to it this weekend,” but every weekend it’s “work was crazy,” “I’m exhausted,” or he gets sucked into gaming and says he “needs to decompress.”\n\nI’ve tried:\n- Making it easy (labeled shelves/drawers, empty closet space)\n- Doing it together (set aside a Saturday, I made coffee/playlist, laid out bins)\n- Breaking it down (one box a day plan)\n- Clear asks (“Can you please handle the bedroom boxes by Sunday?”)\n\nHis reactions range from “yeah, yeah” to defensiveness (“Why are you on my case?”), or jokes about it. Meanwhile, I feel like I’m living in a storage unit and it’s impacting my mood and our intimacy because the space doesn’t feel like a home. I also catch myself resenting him when I trip over a box or can’t find shared stuff (tools, extension cords) because they’re buried.\n\nContext:\n- We split rent 50/50. Lease is 12 months.\n- He lived with roommates before and admitted he was “the messy one.”\n- He keeps his work area tidy; it’s mostly shared spaces and his clothes/old decor that are still boxed.\n- I’m not perfect, but I do regular cleaning and put things away.\n\nI don’t want to be his nagging parent, but I also don’t want to spend the next 9 months living like this. I’ve already done the “I feel X when Y, I need Z” talk twice. It got better for a day, then stalled.\n\nWhat’s a fair boundary/next step here?\n- Concrete deadline with a consequence (e.g., if boxes aren’t unpacked by X date, I’ll hire a task service and he covers the cost)?\n- Assign rooms (I take living room, he takes bedroom) with a date and then we revisit?\n- Or is this a bigger compatibility issue about standards/initiative that I should take seriously now?\n\nTL;DR: Boyfriend hasn’t unpacked since we moved in three months ago, and the constant clutter is affecting our home and relationship. How do I set a firm boundary without turning into the house manager or creating a power struggle?\nsubreddit: relationship_advice",
  "title: My boyfriend’s “jokes” about my looks are wearing me down—how do I set a boundary without starting a war?\n self_text: Me (27F) and my boyfriend (29M) have been together 1.5 years, don’t live together. He’s funny and sweet a lot of the time, but lately his “jokes” about my appearance are getting to me. It started small when I mentioned wanting to get back into the gym—stuff like, “Wow, you’re brave for wearing that after pizza,” “High-waisted pants are doing God’s work,” or “You look better natural,” but also, when I don’t wear makeup, “You look tired.” If I say it hurts, he says I’m too sensitive or “You know I’m joking, I joke with everyone.” I honestly don’t see him do this to others.\n\nI’ve tried:\n- Calmly telling him “Please don’t comment on my body.”\n- One-liners like “That joke doesn’t land for me.”\n- Bringing it up on a neutral day and explaining it’s making me insecure.\n\nEach time he stops for a week and then slips back. Last time he said I was being negative and “ruining the vibe.” For fairness: I’ve teased him about his gaming hours before; I apologized and stopped when he said it bothered him.\n\nI like him a lot—he’s supportive in other areas, plans dates, checks in about my work stress—but I’m starting to dread seeing him because I’m bracing for a dig. My friends say it sounds like negging. I don’t want this to turn into contempt long-term.\n\nHow do I set a hard boundary with consequences without it becoming a huge fight? Are there specific scripts that have worked for you? If he keeps doing it after I’m clear, is that my sign to break up? Or am I overreacting?\n\nTL;DR: BF “jokes” about my body/clothes and dismisses my feelings. I’ve asked him to stop multiple times. Need advice on boundaries and next steps if it continues.\n subreddit: relationship_advice",
  "title: My boyfriend still does weekly “handyman” favors for his ex. Am I being controlling for asking him to stop?\nself_text: Me (27F) and my boyfriend (27M) have been together 1.5 years. He broke up with his ex (~5 year relationship) about 8 months before we met. They “co-parent” a dog that technically lives with her, but he picks the dog up every other weekend.\n\nHere’s the part I’m struggling with: he still goes over there at least once a week to “help” with things—mounting TVs, building furniture, resetting her WiFi, picking up prescriptions when she’s “swamped,” even gave her a 5am airport ride last month. She texts him late at night sometimes (“sorry this is late but the sink is leaking can you come tomorrow?”) and he usually says yes. He keeps a spare key “for emergencies with the dog,” which makes me uncomfortable.\n\nA few times this has directly interfered with our plans (he skipped my mom’s birthday brunch because her TV delivery arrived “early” and he felt bad). I’ve offered compromises like: recommend TaskRabbit, ask a neighbor, or at least schedule during the day when I can come too. He says I’m being insecure/controlling and that he’s just being kind to someone who doesn’t have family nearby and is “bad with tools.” For what it’s worth, she once sent him a “thanks babe” text by accident (he says it was a slip because she used to call him that), and when I met her briefly she made a snide joke about me “stealing her dog dad.”\n\nI don’t want to issue an ultimatum, but I also don’t want to feel like my boyfriend is his ex’s on-call maintenance guy. I feel like reasonable boundaries could be:\n- Any communication stays about the dog (no late-night “favors” texts)\n- No house visits/favors unrelated to the dog\n- Return the spare key; dog exchanges happen in public or at the door\n- If there’s a true emergency with the dog, I’m looped in\n\nDoes that sound fair? Or am I overreacting? How do I bring this up without it turning into “you’re controlling”? Scripts or perspective appreciated.\n\nTL;DR: BF still does weekly handyman/errand favors for his ex and keeps a spare key under the “shared dog” umbrella. It interferes with our relationship. Are the boundaries I want (no non-dog favors, no late-night texts, return key) reasonable, and how do I communicate them well?\nsubreddit: relationship_advice",
  "title: He keeps “just browsing” dating apps even though we’re exclusive and I don’t know if I’m being unreasonable\nself_text: Me (27F) and my boyfriend (29M) have been together 9 months, exclusive for the last 6. Early on, he told me he likes to “scroll” dating apps when he’s bored but “never messages anyone” and it’s “just like window shopping.” He said he likes the UX and people watching. I told him it made me uncomfortable and he said he’d think about deleting them.\n\nFast forward to last week: I saw screenshots of dating profiles in his camera roll dated from last month. He keeps notifications off and Face ID on his phone, but I wasn’t snooping—he handed me his phone to AirDrop photos and the screenshots were right there. I asked him about it and he doubled down that he doesn’t chat with anyone, it’s just mindless scrolling. He said deleting them would be “controlling” and that I should trust him. He also said this helps his ego but has nothing to do with wanting to meet anyone.\n\nContext: I’ve been cheated on before and I’m in therapy working on trust. I’m trying hard not to project, but I also feel like it’s a pretty basic boundary in a committed relationship to not actively use dating apps. I suggested a compromise: if he really wants to keep them for whatever reason, could he at least show me that he isn’t messaging anyone? He said that’s invasive and sets a bad precedent. I get that privacy matters, but so does respect.\n\nOtherwise he’s a good partner—shows up for me, plans dates, is affectionate. We don’t live together yet. I really like him, but I can feel this eroding my self-esteem and making me anxious. I told him I’m leaning toward ending things if this can’t change because it feels like a values mismatch. He said “maybe I’ll delete them later” but won’t give a timeline.\n\nAm I overreacting? Is “just browsing” a thing people actually do in healthy relationships, or is this a red flag I should listen to? What’s a fair boundary here and how do I communicate it without sounding controlling?\n\nTL;DR: Boyfriend of 9 months (exclusive 6) still scrolls dating apps “for fun/ego” and refuses to delete them or show there’s no messaging. My past cheating trauma is triggered, but I also feel like this is a reasonable boundary. Not sure if I should draw a hard line or try another approach.\n\nsubreddit: relationship_advice",
  "title: Am I being controlling for wanting phone/location boundaries after he lied about a night out?\nself_text: I (27F) moved in with my boyfriend (29M) three months ago after a year of semi-long distance. We’ve always said we’re fine with each other having friends of any gender, as long as there’s transparency. I really don’t want to be the phone police in a relationship.\n\nLast weekend he said he was going to a “guys’ night” with coworkers. He came home at 2am. His phone was “dead,” his location sharing was off (it’s normally on because we both use it for safety when we’re out), and he brushed it off like no big deal. The next morning I found a receipt in his jeans for a place that wasn’t on the “guys’ night” plan, with two cocktails and “split tab” hand-written on it. Later I saw an IG story from a female coworker (S) tagging him at the same spot around midnight. I know he had a crush on S before we were official (he told me that himself early on).\n\nWhen I asked about it, his story shifted. First it was “she just showed up for a bit.” Then it became “everyone left and we grabbed a bite, it wasn’t a date.” He apologized for “being vague,” but also said I’m making drama out of nothing and that turning off location was “because my battery was low.”\n\nI told him this really messed with my trust and asked to set some boundaries going forward:\n- No 1:1 drinks with someone he’s had feelings for.\n- Keep location sharing on during nights out (I do the same).\n- If plans change, just shoot me a quick text so I’m not in the dark.\n\nHe says that’s controlling, that I’m punishing him for something he didn’t do, and that I need to “let go of insecurity.” I don’t want to micromanage him, but the lying by omission and the changing story felt really bad.\n\nAre these boundaries reasonable, or am I being controlling? If they are reasonable, how do I present them without it turning into me “policing” him? And if he won’t agree to them, is that my sign to rethink this relationship?\n\nTL;DR: Boyfriend said “guys’ night,” came home late with location off, had a 1:1 stop with a female coworker he used to crush on and only admitted pieces after I found receipts. I want some basic boundaries; he says I’m controlling. Where’s the line?\nsubreddit: relationship_advice",

It happens on Zoom and in person, even when I’ve prepared notes and practiced. I can hear myself trembling and then I spiral and rush through everything or avoid speaking up at all.

  "title: How do I stop being the default “planner” without turning into his mom?\n self_text: I (28F) have been with my boyfriend (29M) for 3 years, living together for 1. I carry the “mental load” and it’s making me resentful. I plan our trips, book appointments (his dentist/doctor, my own, vet), organize holidays/birthdays and buy gifts (including for his family), keep track of bills, groceries, household supplies, and social plans. He’s super kind and says he “appreciates everything,” but defaults to “just tell me what to do.”  I’ve asked for more initiative a bunch of times. He agrees in the moment and then the ball drops again. Things we’ve tried:  - Shared calendar + to-do app. He either ignores notifications or asks me to remind him.  - Dividing chores by area (e.g., “you own laundry and floors, I own dishes and bathrooms”). Works for 1–2 weeks then I find laundry piled up or floors ignored until I cave.  - Weekly “house meeting.” It turns into me listing tasks and him saying “yep” without actually leading anything.  He’s not malicious or lazy in other parts of life—he works full-time, shows up for friends, and is an attentive partner in other ways. He hasn’t been evaluated for ADHD; I’ve gently suggested it but he says he’s “just forgetful.” I don’t want to nag or become the default manager forever. It’s killing my attraction because I feel like a parent, not a partner.  I’m looking for concrete scripts/strategies to reset the dynamic:  - How do I assign true ownership without chasing? (“You fully own X. I will not remind you.”)  - What natural consequences do I let happen without sabotaging myself? (E.g., if he doesn’t book his dentist, I don’t secretly do it; if he doesn’t plan date night, we simply don’t go.)  - How do I measure real change vs. love-bombing for a week?  - Any resources (books/podcasts) that helped you split the mental load fairly?  I love him and want this to work, but I need a partner who notices/initiates.

  "title: My boyfriend still shares locations with his ex “because of the dog” and won’t stop. Am I overreacting?\n self_text: I (27F) have been with my boyfriend (29M) for a year. He dated his ex for ~4 years and they broke up about 18 months before we met. They co-adopted a rescue (6yo) who lives with her. They do occasional vet visits and weekend hangs, and I’ve been fine with that as long as it’s about the dog.  What I’m not fine with: he still shares his live location with his ex. He says it’s “for dog emergencies” and because she gets anxious if the dog is sick and she can’t reach him. I suggested they only turn on location during hand-offs or vet days, or set up a shared calendar instead. He says I’m being controlling and that it’s “not a big deal.”  It bothers me because:  - She has used it to “accidentally” bump into him twice (once at his gym, once at a bar he goes to with coworkers). He brushed it off as coincidence.  - She sometimes texts late at night after she sees he’s out (“grab some meds for the dog?” “are you nearby?”), which feels like a pretext.  - He didn’t tell me about the sharing; I noticed when directions popped up on CarPlay with her address and he admitted they never turned it off after the breakup.  I’m not trying to cut him off from the dog or police his phone. I just feel like perpetual live location with an ex (who already has used it socially) is a boundary issue. I’d be okay with:  - Only sharing location for a defined window on dog-related days  - Using calendar/tasks for meds/vet, or having me included if it’s after-hours  He keeps saying, “If you trust me it shouldn’t matter.” I do trust that he’s not cheating; I don’t trust that this setup is respectful to our relationship.

He’s very social and has a lot of female friends from work and an old hobby group. I’m generally fine with that — I’ve met some of them and they’ve been nice to me.\n\nWhat’s been bothering me is the timing and tone of some of his messages. A couple of times in the past month, his phone buzzed after midnight and he went to the bathroom to reply. I didn’t snoop, but one night when we were both using his phone to check concert tickets a notification popped up from a coworker (F) that said, “can’t sleep either lol want to talk?” at 12:47am. Another was an old friend (F) texting him at 1:15am about “missing our deep talks.” He says it’s totally platonic and that he’s just being supportive.\n\nI told him that late-night, one-on-one chats feel intimate to me and make me uncomfortable, especially because my last relationship ended in cheating that started as “just talking late.” I asked for two boundaries:\n- No 1:1 late-night (say after 10/11pm) text convos with people outside the relationship unless it’s urgent.\n- If something does come up late, just be transparent (“X is going through something; I’m going to check in for a minute”).\n\nHe said that’s “controlling,” that he’s allowed to talk to his friends whenever, and that my insecurity isn’t his problem to fix. He also said he doesn’t want to feel policed in his own home. For what it’s worth, I’m not asking for his passwords or to cut people off — just to keep those convos to reasonable hours or give me a heads-up.\n\nI’m trying to figure out if:\n- My boundary is reasonable, and how to present it without sounding accusatory.\n- This is a values mismatch (what “appropriate” looks like) vs. me needing to do more personal work on trust.\n- If there’s a compromise we’re missing (e.g., moving chats to group threads, or quick check-ins vs. hour-long late calls).\n\nHow would you approach this conversation? What feels like a healthy, respectful boundary vs. controlling? If you’ve navigated something similar, what worked?\n\nTL;DR: Boyfriend has late-night 1:1 chats with female friends; I asked for a “no late-night non-urgent chats” boundary and transparency.

No replies, but he’ll watch my stories or I’ll see him gaming with friends. When I bring it up, he says texting drains him and he’s “overwhelmed” with work, promises to do better, and then the cycle repeats.    I’ve tried setting a low bar like “just a quick check-in once a day” or “let me know if you’re going off-grid,” but he calls it “micromanaging” and says our love languages are different.

Today I came home to find she had “deep-cleaned” our kitchen—moved things around, threw out some old spices I was still using, and put a donation bag I made for Goodwill out on the curb without asking.   I told my fiancé this makes me feel like our home isn’t private and that I’m not being respected. He said I’m overreacting and that “this is how she shows love,” and that taking the key back would “hurt her feelings.” I suggested we use a lockbox on the balcony with a code for true emergencies and set a firm boundary about calling/texting before coming over.

He brushed it off with “Babe, lighten up. They know I’m kidding.” Later, during a group convo, he wrapped his arm around me and said, “She’s tiny but mighty… mostly tiny,” and added, “Hey, at least I save on heels.” I felt humiliated.\n\nI told him I was calling a ride and heading home. He said I was being dramatic and to “just go with it.” I said I didn’t want to be the punchline all night and I left. He had plenty of coworkers there and could Uber; I didn’t “strand” him.

On paper things are great—he’s supportive with my career, is kind to my family, and we have fun. But any time I try to talk about something that’s bothering me, it turns into the same cycle and I’m starting to question if this is normal.\n\nExamples:\n- If he’s late repeatedly and doesn’t text, I’ll say, “Can you just let me know if you’re running late?” He’ll sigh, say I’m “making a big deal out of nothing,” and go quiet for the rest of the night.\n- He forgot to pay his half of a couple bills twice. When I brought it up calmly, he said I was “keeping score” and “nagging.”\n- He still follows his ex on IG (they occasionally like each other’s posts). I asked how he felt about unfollowing for boundaries and he called it “controlling” and said I’m “insecure.”\n- When I ask for help planning/cleaning (I do most of it), he’ll say I should have “just asked” even though I do, then get defensive if I mention it again later.\n\nThe pattern is: I bring something up as neutrally as I can, he says I’m overreacting/too sensitive, then shuts down or gives me the silent treatment. Eventually he’s sweet again like nothing happened, but the original issue never gets resolved. I’ve started writing down what I want to say beforehand and using “I” statements. Same result.\n\nI’m not trying to label him or diagnose anything—I just want to know if this sounds like normal friction or if I’m missing a bigger issue with communication/respect. I’m in therapy and working on not personalizing everything and being direct, but I feel like I’m walking on eggshells to avoid being called “dramatic.”\n\nWhat would you do here?

  "title: AITA for asking my sister to leave Thanksgiving because she brought her dog after I said no?\nself_text: I (28F) hosted Thanksgiving this year for the first time. My husband (30M) and I have a 2-year-old who has a confirmed allergy to dog dander (hives + wheezing last time he was around a shedding dog; pediatrician told us to avoid exposure). We deep-cleaned the house and told everyone ahead of time: no pets, please.\n\nMy sister (26F) has a 60 lb rescue she is obsessed with. I like the dog, but she sheds a lot. I called my sister a week before and explained that our kid’s allergy isn’t a preference, it’s medical, and that we’d love to have her but we can’t have her dog in the house. I offered options: she could come without the dog, we could help pay for a reputable sitter for the day, or she could come early and we’d set up a comfy, heated area in our attached garage or on the back porch (gated, covered, bed, water, heater) for quick visits/walks—just not inside.\n\nShe said the dog is her emotional support animal and “goes everywhere” with her. I asked if she had documentation (I know that doesn’t magically override allergies, but I was trying to understand). She said she didn’t need to “prove” anything and accused me of not caring about her mental health.\n\nDay of, she shows up… with the dog, no crate, no leash beyond a retractable, and a bag of treats. I calmly reminded her of our boundary. She tried to walk the dog right in anyway. I blocked the doorway and repeated our options: dog on the porch/garage with the setup we prepared (space heater, cozy bed, fresh water, a long lead for safety), or she could take the dog home and come back, or skip this year. She said I was cruel and that “a little hair won’t kill anyone.” My mom chimed in that I should “compromise” because “it’s just one day.” Dad said he’d vacuum after. My kid was already rubbing his eyes just from the coat transfer and my sister standing in the entry.\n\nAt that point, I told my sister she needed to leave with the dog if she wouldn’t respect the boundary. She stormed off, my parents left with her, and now I’m getting texts saying I ruined the holiday and “chose a spotless house over family.” I tried to explain it wasn’t about mess—it’s about our kid’s health.\n\nFor what it’s worth, everyone else still there had a nice dinner. My sister posted a story about “being excluded because of an ESA” and my aunt is calling me heartless. I feel like I did everything I could to accommodate without risking my child.

I said I’m not comfortable doing couple things if we’re on a break, and he got a little annoyed and said I was “making rules” and “turning this into a breakup.”\n\nI’m confused because it feels like he wants all the benefits without the label or effort. I tried suggesting some boundaries (no intimacy during the break, a check-in after finals to reevaluate, actually telling our close friends so it’s not a secret) and he said that felt “dramatic” and that I’m overthinking. We share the same friend group so I’m also worried about the awkwardness.\n\nI don’t want to make a rash decision during finals, but I also don’t want to be in limbo while he decides if he wants to be with me. Is a “break” like this normal? Should I agree to his version, set firmer boundaries, or just end it and protect my sanity? Any advice on handling this with shared friends is appreciated too.\n\nTL;DR: BF wants a “break” due to stress but still wants to call, hang out, and cuddle, and doesn’t want either of us to see other people. I feel like it’s relationship benefits without commitment. Do I set boundaries, say no to the break, or end it?\nsubreddit: relationship_advice",
  "title: Boyfriend refuses to come to Christmas with my family, says holidays are “private” — is this a red flag or a boundary I should respect?\nself_text: Me (27F) and my boyfriend (29M) have been together for 10 months. Things are genuinely good in most areas: we communicate pretty well, we don’t fight often, and he’s kind and thoughtful day-to-day. The sticking point is anything to do with family.\n\nHe’s met a couple of my friends and it was fine. He’s met my parents zero times. I’m pretty close to them and they live 45 minutes away. I’ve invited him to casual things a few times (Sunday lunch, a quick coffee after my mom’s doctor appointment in his neighborhood, etc.) and he always has a reason he can’t go (work late, needs to “recharge,” already has plans with a friend). It’s never rude, just always a no.\n\nNow it’s holiday season and my parents want to host a small Christmas Eve dinner (7 people total: me, my parents, my brother + his girlfriend, my aunt). I asked my BF to come for just 90 minutes — I even offered to drive separately so he can leave early, and to skip gift exchange if that makes him uncomfortable. He told me that “holidays are private” for him, that he finds family holidays “performative,” and that he wants to keep that time for rest. He also said he’d “rather meet my parents in a more neutral, low-stakes context… next year.”\n\nFor context: he’s not close with his own parents (mildly estranged, no big blowout story, more a slow fade + emotional distance). He did introduce me to his sister once when we bumped into her at a farmer’s market, and I’ve been to a few of his friends’ gatherings. He’s not hiding me from everyone — it’s specifically family stuff. He says meeting parents “feels like an interview” and holidays are extra pressure.\n\nI get that background matters and I want to be respectful of boundaries. But this is starting to feel like avoidance. We’ve talked loosely about moving in together next spring, and it worries me that he keeps pushing “later” on meeting my family. My parents think he’s not serious and I’m embarrassed to keep making excuses. I don’t want to force him, but I also don’t want to keep sidelining something that matters to me.\n\nQuestions:\n- Is this a reasonable boundary I should accept for now, or a compatibility problem/early red flag?\n- What’s a fair compromise (short coffee before NYE, set a date in January to meet them for 30 minutes, etc.)?\n- Scripts for how to say “This is important to me” without making him feel cornered?\n- At 10 months, is it fair to expect he’s met my parents at least once?\n\nTL;DR: Together 10 months. BF refuses to come to a small Christmas Eve dinner with my family and hasn’t met my parents at all, citing “holidays are private” and stress around family. I’ve offered compromises. Don’t want to force him, but I’m worried this is avoidance and a bad sign for moving in. How do I handle this?\nsubreddit: relationship_advice",
  "title: Keep bailing on dates at the last minute because of anxiety — how do I break the cycle?\n self_text: 27F, new-ish to the city. I match with someone, vibe over text, set a time/place… and then the day of the date I start spiraling. I’ll overthink my outfit, worry I’ll be awkward or disappointing in person, convince myself they’re going to judge me, and then I either cancel with a lame excuse or just stop replying. Immediately after, I feel gross and guilty and lonely, promise myself I won’t do it again… and then repeat it next time.\n\nI’m not proud of this and I know it wastes people’s time. Therapy is on my to-do list but I’m on a waitlist. In the meantime, I’d really appreciate practical things that helped you push through first-date anxiety without nuking your chances:\n- What small “first step” dates worked for you (short coffee walk, museum, etc.)?\n- Do you tell dates upfront that you get anxious so expectations are set?\n- Any scripts for canceling in a respectful way if I truly can’t make it, without burning the bridge?\n- Day-of routines that calm nerves (phone rules, breathing, music, arriving early/with a friend nearby)?\n- How do you stop the last-hour catastrophizing?\n\nI do want to meet someone and I’m fine once I’m actually there — it’s that 2–3 hours before that kills me. Would love to hear what’s worked for others.\n\nTL;DR: I keep canceling first dates right before because anxiety ramps up.

  "title: AITA for refusing to pay for my sister’s wedding dress after she insulted my wife?\n self_text: I (29M) have a sister (31F) getting married next spring. My wife (26F) and I had a small courthouse wedding last year that we paid for ourselves. My sister’s wedding is more traditional/expensive, and my parents asked each sibling to “chip in” for her dress as a family gesture. I told my sister I could contribute $500. She said she had her heart set on a designer gown that’s around $2,000 and asked me to cover that entire amount “since you and your wife saved so much on your wedding.”  Fast forward to a family brunch a few weeks ago. My sister was showing us dress options on her phone, and out of nowhere she made a dig at my wife: “At least mine won’t look like a sundress from a thrift store,” then laughed. For context, my wife wore a simple white dress that she thrifted and had tailored—it looked beautiful and classy. My wife smiled it off in the moment, but she was clearly hurt.  A week later, my sister sent a group text to me and my parents with a payment request for $2,000, writing “OP can cover the dress since he went cheap on his own.” I responded privately to my sister and said her comments about my wife were rude and uncalled for, and that I’d no longer be contributing anything unless she apologized. She doubled down and called my wife “insecure” and said I was “punishing” her for having standards.  Now my mom is telling me to “be the bigger person” and just pay because my sister is “under a lot of stress.” My dad is staying out of it. My older brother already sent $300 before all this happened and says I should do what I want. My wife says we don’t owe my sister a dime, but she also feels guilty that I’m fighting with family over this. I can afford the $500 I originally offered, but not $2,000—and honestly, at this point it feels like a respect issue, not money.  I told my sister I’d be willing to pay for alterations or accessories if she apologizes to my wife. She says I’m holding the wedding hostage.

  "title: How do I set a fair deadline without feeling cruel? I (26F) pay for everything while my BF (27M) “job hunts” and plays games all night.\nself_text: Throwaway because he knows my main.\n\nWe’ve been together 1.5 years, living together 5 months. He was laid off 6 months ago. Since moving in, I’ve covered 100% of rent, utilities, groceries, his phone line—everything. He keeps saying he’s applying and “something will hit,” but most nights he’s gaming until 3–4am, then sleeping until noon. He’s missed two interviews (once “slept through alarms,” once “anxiety attack”) and turned down a temp job because it was “beneath him.” I’ve helped rewrite his resume, sat with him to submit applications, even offered to pay for a therapist for his anxiety—he said no.\n\nHe does cook occasionally and will run an errand if I ask multiple times, but the default is dishes piling up and me coming home from work to a dark apartment and him in Discord. We’ve had several calm talks where I ask for a plan and some contribution (even small—gig work, part-time, chores). He gets defensive and says I’m “being transactional” and not supportive. Then we repeat the cycle.\n\nLease is in my name, no kids, my cat. I love him, but I’m exhausted and resentful. I don’t want to parent a partner. I want to set a deadline like: “By X date you need a job (any income), consistent effort (apps, interviews), and to contribute to bills/housework, or you need to find other housing.” Is 30 days reasonable? How do I word this kindly but firmly so it doesn’t turn into a screaming match? What do I do if he refuses to leave? I feel guilty with holidays coming, but I’m burning out.\n\nTL;DR: Boyfriend has been unemployed for months, stays up gaming, contributes little. I pay for everything and I’m done.

  "title: My boyfriend keeps “browsing” dating apps even though we’re exclusive — am I overreacting?\nself_text: I (27F) have been with my boyfriend (29M) for 8 months, exclusive for the last 5. I recently noticed Hinge and Bumble on his phone. When I asked, he said he doesn’t chat or meet anyone, he “just scrolls” when he’s bored because he likes reading prompts and “seeing what’s out there,” the same way he’d scroll Instagram. He calls it harmless and says it’s a dopamine thing.\n\nThis really bothers me. I’ve been cheated on in the past (he knows this), and while I’m not accusing him of cheating, it feels like keeping one foot out the door. I asked if he could delete/disable the apps as a show of respect. He said I was being controlling and that he doesn’t tell me what I can or can’t look at online. We tried a compromise where he “paused” his profiles, but a week later I saw the apps were still installed and he admitted he’d been “browsing” again. He swears he hasn’t messaged anyone and hasn’t gone on any dates.\n\nI don’t want to police him, but I also don’t want to ignore my boundary just to keep the peace. Is “no dating apps while exclusive” a reasonable boundary? How do I communicate this without it turning into me being “controlling”? And if he refuses to delete them, is that a sign of incompatibility/dealbreaker?\n\nTL;DR: Boyfriend says he only “browses” dating apps for fun even though we’re exclusive. I’m uncomfortable and want them gone; he says I’m controlling. What’s a fair boundary here and how should I approach this?\nsubreddit: relationship_advice",
  "title: He jokes about proposing but won’t introduce me to his family after 2 years — what do I do?\nself_text: I (27F) have been with my boyfriend (29M) for just over 2 years. He’s wonderful in a lot of ways — kind, consistent, great with my friends/family, talks openly about our future, and he even jokes about proposing “soon.” We’ve talked about moving in together next spring.\n\nBut I haven’t met his family. Not once. Not even on FaceTime.\n\nI’ve met all his friends and some coworkers. I spend most weekends at his place. He’s met my parents multiple times and comes to holidays. When it comes to his family, there’s always a reason: “They’re intense,” “My mom is overbearing,” “They’re super religious and will judge,” “My sister’s going through stuff,” “Let’s wait until after [x event].”\n\nHe did tell them he’s dating someone (me), but apparently no details. On holidays/birthdays, he goes alone. He also hides my toothbrush and a couple of my things when his mom “pops by” because he doesn’t want questions. He says he’s protecting me and our peace until he’s ready to deal with their opinions. He had an ex they didn’t like and it “blew up” his life, so he’s skittish.\n\nI’ve tried to be understanding. I’ve told him I can be polite, low-key, and take it slow (coffee first, whatever). I’ve also been clear that it hurts to feel like a secret after two years. Every time I bring it up, he says “soon,” hugs me, and changes the subject. It’s been “soon” for about 8 months.\n\nI’m starting to feel resentful and anxious about building a future with someone who won’t integrate me into a huge part of his life. I’m thinking of pausing our move-in plans until we at least meet once. Is that reasonable? How do I set a boundary without it sounding like an ultimatum? And am I missing something here — is this a legitimate “protect the relationship” approach, or a big red flag?\n\nTL;DR: Together 2 years, he talks marriage and is great in most ways, but still won’t introduce me to his family. Says they’re intense/religious and he’s protecting us. It’s been “soon” for months. How do I handle this without blowing everything up?\nsubreddit: relationship_advice",
  "title: My fiancé wants to combine finances, but he has secret debt and I’m freaking out\n self_text: I (28F) and my fiancé (30M) have been together 4 years, engaged 8 months, wedding in June. We’ve always split bills pretty evenly and kept separate accounts. He recently brought up combining finances once we’re married and using a joint account for everything.  I’m not opposed in theory, but a few weeks ago I accidentally found out he has way more debt than he ever told me. I was looking for a warranty email on his laptop (with his permission), and an overdue notice popped up. I asked him about it and after a lot of back and forth he admitted he has about $14k on two credit cards and a few Buy Now Pay Later payments. He’s been paying minimums, sometimes late. He also casually mentioned placing small sports bets “for fun” which I had no idea about.  He says it’s under control and that I’m making a big deal out of nothing. I’m anxious because I’ve worked really hard to keep my credit clean and save (I have about $20k in savings for the wedding/honeymoon/emergency fund). We’ve already put down about $5k in non-refundable deposits.  I suggested:  - We postpone combining finances until his debt is paid down significantly  - Keep separate personal accounts, create one joint household account for rent/bills/groceries based on income percentage  - Full transparency: monthly check-ins, share credit reports, no new debt without discussing  - Consider a prenup outlining separate debts and assets  He says that feels like “punishment” and that marriage means being a team. I agree in principle, but I also think teams have playbooks and accountability. He refuses a prenup and says it’s “planning for divorce.”  I love him and I want this to work, but my stomach is in knots. Am I overreacting? Is it reasonable to ask for a prenup or to keep finances partially separate until the debt is under control? Do I push to postpone the wedding to sort this out, or is there a middle path I’m missing? Any advice from people who’ve navigated this would be appreciated.  TL;DR: Fiancé wants to fully combine finances, I just found out he has $14k in hidden debt and occasionally sports bets.

  "title: Is it fair to ask for a social media boundary or am I being controlling?\nself_text: Me (26F) and my boyfriend (27M) have been together a year. He’s great in a lot of ways, but I’m struggling with how he uses social media and I don’t know if I’m being reasonable.\n\nHe follows a ton of bikini/OnlyFans-adjacent accounts and still follows his ex plus a couple of girls he hooked up with before me. He doesn’t DM them (as far as I know), but he regularly likes their posts and sometimes watches all their stories. He says it’s “mindless scrolling” and “just pictures,” and that asking him to unfollow or stop liking is “controlling.”\n\nFor context:\n- I’ve never snooped. I only see the likes because his activity pops up when we’re scrolling together or because the same people tag him.\n- I don’t care if he follows friends/coworkers/normal influencers. It’s specifically the thirst accounts and ex/old flings that bother me.\n- I’ve tried to explain it’s not about policing him, it’s about feeling respected. It makes me feel compared and kind of humiliated when mutual friends see his likes under girls who used to be in his bed.\n- He says if I “trusted him” it wouldn’t be an issue and that it’s “normal for guys.” He also threw back that I follow male actors and a couple fitness guys (I don’t like or comment on thirst pics though).\n\nI suggested a middle ground:\n- Unfollow exes/old flings and stop publicly liking thirst posts.\n- If he wants to look, fine, but don’t leave a breadcrumb trail that makes me feel small.\n- I’ll also unfollow or mute any accounts he’s uncomfortable with.\n\nHe said that’s a “slippery slope” and doesn’t want “rules.” Now I’m stuck between feeling petty and feeling disrespected.\n\nAm I making a big deal out of nothing? Is this a compatibility mismatch? What’s a fair boundary here? I don’t want to nag, but I also don’t want to swallow something that keeps making me feel crappy.\n\nTL;DR: Boyfriend likes thirst traps and still follows ex/old flings.

  "title: AITA for telling my sister I won’t babysit anymore after she docked my “pay” for eating a snack?\nself_text: I (26F) regularly babysit for my sister (29F) three evenings a week while she and BIL work late. It’s not a formal job, more a family arrangement, but she gives me $60/night plus gas because it’s a long drive and I go straight from my own job. I love my niece (2F) and nephew (5M), and until now it’s been fine.\n\nLast week I came over straight from work and didn’t have time to grab dinner. Kids ate, I put them down, and I grabbed a yogurt and a granola bar from their pantry. I figured it wasn’t a big deal—I've brought food over plenty of times and I always clean up, do dishes, fold laundry, etc.\n\nNext day my sister sent me a Venmo for $112 instead of $120 and attached a note: “- $8 for yogurt + granola = kids’ snacks.” I honestly thought it was a joke. I texted her and she said she wasn’t kidding, that those snacks are portioned for the kids, and if I want food I should bring my own or ask first. I told her I was coming from work, one yogurt and bar after wrangling two kids for 5 hours felt reasonable, and nickel-and-diming me over pantry items is insulting.\n\nShe doubled down, said “it’s about boundaries” and “you can’t just take things—those are budgeted for.” I said if that’s how it is, I’m not comfortable babysitting anymore unless we agree she won’t dock my pay for eating a small snack while I’m working. She said I was being dramatic and “stealing from my kids.” Our parents think I overreacted and should “just pack a sandwich.” BIL texted me separately to say he appreciated the help but “house rules are house rules.”\n\nI’m not trying to be entitled; I would’ve happily replaced the yogurt if she’d asked. But docking my pay over $8 (which seems inflated anyway) felt petty and kind of demeaning, especially when I’m doing them a big favor multiple nights a week.\n\nAITA for refusing to babysit anymore unless she stops docking my pay for snacks?\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",

I’ve got the ring and I’m ready, but I’m stuck on the how.\n\nShe really dislikes being the center of attention. No surprise parties, no flash mobs, hates being recorded, and has specifically said a public proposal would make her shut down. She’s also said she wants it to feel “thoughtful,” not “performative.” Totally fair — I want the same. The tricky part is that her family is super sentimental and kind of expects big moments to be shared/filmed.

It started after I went on a long run, my phone died, and I didn’t answer for a couple hours—he was worried and drove the route looking for me. I get why he was anxious, and I offered to text him when I leave/arrive places and use “Share ETA” when I’m out late. He says that’s not enough and wants permanent sharing “for safety.”  We tried location sharing for two weeks, and it made me uncomfortable. He would text me asking why I stopped at certain stores or why I took a different route, and we got into an argument when my phone died again and my dot disappeared.

For what it’s worth, I’m not cheating or doing anything shady—I just want some privacy and the freedom to run errands or grab coffee without feeling like someone’s watching my dot move around a map.\n\nSome examples that set off alarms for me:\n- My phone died at the gym and he called the front desk to “check on me” because Find My stopped updating. Then he drove over unannounced “just in case.”\n- He gets anxious if I take longer than expected to get home and asks for a pic or a pin so he knows exactly where I am.\n- He had an ex who lied about where she was, and he’s admitted that’s part of why this matters to him.\n\nI care about his anxiety and want him to feel secure, but this feels like it crosses into control.

My boyfriend leaves at 6am and I’ve been doing all the feeds, crate training, and cleanup. I’m exhausted and my carpets are trashed.\n\nThe landlord wants a $500 deposit plus $50/month. My boyfriend said he’d cover it since it’s “part of my gift,” but then asked if I could spot him until his next paycheck. Money is tight for me, and I did not consent to this. When I told him this crossed a boundary (we explicitly agreed “no surprise living creatures”), he said I was being ungrateful and embarrassed him by not being ecstatic.\n\nI love animals and I don’t want to be cruel, but this feels like a gift of labor, time, and money I never agreed to. The breeder’s contract says we can return the puppy within 14 days. I’m considering asking him to take full responsibility or return the puppy now, before I get even more attached. I already feel like a monster for thinking it.\n\nHow do I bring this up without it turning into a huge fight? Is it reasonable to insist on returning the puppy given the boundary we set? Is this a red flag big enough to reconsider the relationship if he won’t acknowledge how disrespectful this was?\n subreddit: relationship_advice",
  "title: My boyfriend keeps inviting his ex to our group plans without telling me first\n self_text: I (27F) have been dating my boyfriend (29M) for almost a year. We share a friend group because we met through them, and one of those friends is his ex (28F). They dated a few years ago and broke up before I was in the picture. I knew they were still friendly, and I’ve tried to be mature about it.\n\nWhat’s bothering me is he keeps inviting her to group hangouts without telling me ahead of time. I’ll show up to trivia night or a hike and she’s there—no heads-up. It wouldn’t feel so weird if we’d at least talked about it, but I end up feeling blindsided and awkward. I’ve been polite with her (she’s never been rude to me), but it’s hard to relax when I don’t have any warning.\n\nI brought it up calmly and said a heads-up would help me not feel caught off guard. He said I’m “making it a thing” and that he shouldn’t have to run every guest list by me. He also said she’s part of the friend group, so she’s naturally going to be at stuff. I get that, but it feels like a basic courtesy to tell your partner when your ex is coming, especially when you know it’s a sensitive spot.\n\nFor more context: earlier on, she DM’d him a long message about “missing how they used to talk.” He showed me the message and said he set a boundary (no one-on-one chats, group only). That helped, but the surprise invites keep happening and I’m starting to resent going to things.\n\nAm I being unreasonable asking for a heads-up? I’m not trying to ban her from events or control the group. I’d just like to know when she’ll be there so I can mentally prepare or choose to skip if I’m not up for it. Any advice or scripts on how to set this boundary without starting a power struggle?\n\nTL;DR: My BF keeps inviting his ex to group plans without telling me, I feel blindsided, asked for a simple heads-up, and he says I’m making it a big deal. How do I handle this?\n subreddit: relationship_advice",
  "title: Boyfriend says I’m “controlling” for not wanting his ex on our friends’ holiday trip. Am I wrong?\n self_text: Me (27F) and my boyfriend (29M) have been together 1.5 years. He dated his ex (28F) for 5 years, broke up ~2 years before we met. They share the same friend group, so I’ve tried to be cool about group hangouts where she’s around. I don’t love it, but I’ve dealt with it because the breakup wasn’t “messy” and they both swear they’re just friends now.\n\nThe issue: their friend group planned a holiday cabin weekend next month (8 people, 3 bedrooms + a loft). When the sleeping arrangements got posted, his ex ended up on the pullout in the same room me and my BF are sharing “because it’s the only layout that works.” I told my BF I’m uncomfortable sleeping in the same room as his ex for an entire weekend and asked if we could adjust: ex sleeps in the living room, or we bring an air mattress, or we offer to split a cheap nearby motel room for someone, or we skip and drive up for a day trip. He said I’m being “controlling” and “making group logistics about my insecurity.”\n\nContext that adds to my discomfort:\n- She texts him daily (memes/inside jokes) and sometimes late at night. He says it’s harmless. I’ve asked that late-night texts slow down; he said I’m policing his phone.\n- Twice now she’s FaceTimed him when we were together; he took it outside. He said he didn’t want to be “rude” to her.\n- When I’ve met her, she’s been polite but a little prickly (a comment about “oh, you finally learned to like IPA?” that felt pointed).\n- He insists he’s never cheated and I have no reason not to believe that, but it still feels like there are blurred lines.\n\nI told him I’m not trying to ban her or split the friend group, I just don’t want to share a room with her, and I’d like some clearer boundaries (no late-night calls/texts, keep convos more group-based than 1:1, definitely separate sleeping spaces on trips). He says that’s “controlling” and I’m asking him to “choose.” He also told me if I don’t like the room assignments, I don’t have to go.\n\nI don’t want to be the jealous girlfriend, but I also don’t think sharing a room with an ex is a reasonable expectation. Am I overreacting? What’s a fair boundary here? Do I bow out of the trip, or is this a bigger red flag about the relationship?\n subreddit: relationship_advice",
  "title: Is it disrespectful that my girlfriend still has sleepovers at her guy best friend’s place?\nself_text: Me (27M) and my girlfriend (26F) have been together 10 months, exclusive for 8. She has a long-time male best friend (28M) from high school. They’re part of the same D&D/video game group that meets on weekends and sometimes weeknights. The sessions often run late, and she’ll “crash on the couch” at his place a couple times a month.\n\nI don’t think she’s cheating and she’s never given me a reason not to trust her in general. But this situation makes me uncomfortable. I offered to pick her up, pay for an Uber, or have her crash at my place (I live 15 minutes away). She says it’s just easier/safer to sleep there because it’s usually past 2am and everyone’s wiped. She says it’s always in the living room and sometimes other people crash too, but when I asked who, the answer changes depending on the night.\n\nI’ve asked to meet him and the group properly (not to police it, just to put faces to names), and we haven’t made it happen. It’s always “bad timing” or “you wouldn’t have fun, it’s nerdy.” I’m nerdy. I would 100% have fun. I’ve also asked for a simple boundary: no opposite-sex sleepovers unless it’s a group trip/event where everyone is staying over. She says that’s controlling and that I should “trust her, not rules.”\n\nAdditional context:\n- She keeps a toothbrush and pajamas at his place “so I don’t have to lug stuff back and forth.”\n- We don’t live together, but we do spend 3–4 nights a week together otherwise.\n- There hasn’t been cheating in either of our pasts, but I did leave a relationship once because boundaries kept getting pushed.\n\nI’m trying not to come from a place of insecurity, but I can’t shake the feeling that this crosses a line for me. I’m not asking her to stop being friends with him. I’m asking to meet him and to move the “sleeping over at a guy friend’s house” part to a different solution (ride share, my place, etc.). She’s framed this as me being controlling and says “if you trust me, it shouldn’t matter where I sleep.”\n\nQuestions:\n- Is this a reasonable boundary or am I out of line?\n- How do I communicate this without it turning into “you don’t trust me”?\n- If this is a non-negotiable for both of us (she keeps doing it, I can’t get comfortable with it), is that my sign this match isn’t right?\n\nLooking for perspective, especially from people who’ve navigated similar friend dynamics without blowing up the relationship.\nsubreddit: relationship_advice",
  "title: My boyfriend keeps making “jokes” about my weight in front of friends and I don’t know how to set a boundary\n self_text: I’m 27F, my boyfriend is 28M, together 3 years living together for 1. I’ve gained about 15 lbs this year (new meds + long hours at work). Lately he’s been making “jokes” about it when we’re with friends or his family: things like “do you really need a second slice?” or calling me “extra thicc” and doing the exaggerated eyebrow thing. Everyone laughs, I freeze, then I spend the rest of the night feeling embarrassed.\n\nWhen I bring it up privately, he says it’s just banter and that I’m “not fun anymore” and “too sensitive.” I tried “I” statements, I sent him a message explaining exactly how it makes me feel, and he apologized once… but the next weekend he did it again with a “lighten up, it’s a joke.”\n\nThis is starting to make me dread social stuff and even what I put on my plate at home. Outside of this, he’s a good partner—helpful, kind, affectionate. I don’t want to blow up our relationship, but I need this to stop. How do I set a firm boundary that actually sticks? What’s a clear script I can use in the moment if he does it again in front of people, and what consequences make sense if he keeps crossing it? Is this a “dealbreaker” thing and I’m just delaying the inevitable?\n subreddit: relationship_advice",
  "title: AITA for leaving Friendsgiving after my friend kept \"forgetting\" I'm allergic to dairy?\n self_text: I (28F) have a confirmed dairy allergy (not lactose intolerance — I carry an epipen, I read labels, I’ve had reactions from cross-contact). I told the host “Lily” (29F) weeks in advance that I’d bring a couple dairy-free dishes and asked if she could keep one veggie side plain so I could have something from the main spread. She said “Of course! Easy.”\n \nDay of Friendsgiving I show up with DF mashed potatoes and a DF dessert. In the kitchen, I see Lily sautéing green beans in olive oil, great. I put a sticky note on the lid “please keep dairy-free” and we all move on. \n \nFast forward 20 minutes and I catch her friend “Sam” (30M) tossing a knob of butter into the pan. I say, “Hey, please don’t — I’m allergic.” He laughs and says, “It’s just a tiny bit,” and Lily goes, “Oops! I forgot. Sorry.” No big blowup from me, but now that’s off the table for me. I shrug and stick to my own dishes. \n \nLater, Lily brings out a salad and says, “This one’s safe for you,” and then immediately grates parmesan over the whole bowl while talking to someone, totally not thinking. I literally reached over and said, “Wait!” and she did that nervous laugh and apologized again. I felt embarrassed and also hungry. I asked if we could set aside a portion without cheese next time before dressing, and she said, “Yeah yeah.”\n \nThen, as we’re about to eat, Sam says he “rescued” my dairy-free mashed potatoes by stirring in cream because they were “too dry.” I honestly wanted to cry. Three separate “oops” moments and all the safe stuff I brought was now contaminated. I quietly told Lily I was going to head out because I didn’t have anything I could safely eat, and I didn’t want to risk a reaction. I left my dessert because others could still enjoy it, said goodbye, and went home. \n \nNow the group chat is split. A couple people DM’d me saying they’re sorry and that it was messed up. Lily texted a long apology saying she was overwhelmed hosting and it was a mistake, but Sam and two others are saying I overreacted and “made a scene” by leaving (I didn’t raise my voice or call anyone out, I just said I needed to go). Sam also said I should “just take a Lactaid next time,” which… is not how allergies work.\n \nI genuinely like these people and I know hosting is stressful, but I gave a lot of notice, brought my own food, labeled things, and repeatedly reminded them. It felt like they didn’t take my health seriously. AITA for leaving?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole"
