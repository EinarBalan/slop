  "title: 5800X + 3080 struggling to hold 240 fps in OW2 at 1440p—7800X3D platform upgrade or 4070 Ti Super?\n self_text: - Current build: Ryzen 7 5800X on B550 Tomahawk, 32GB (2x16) DDR4-3200 CL16, RTX 3080, 1TB SN850, RM750x, Lancool 215 (2x140 front + 1x120 rear), Noctua U12S, 1440p 240 Hz IPS (G-Sync compatible).\n\n- Games: Overwatch 2 (support/Mercy), Warzone, Apex. Competitive settings (low/medium; upscalers off), Nvidia Reflex on.\n\n- Pain point: I can hit 240 fps peaks, but 1% lows dip to ~120–140 in team fights and I get visible frametime spikes, especially in OW2 during chaotic fights. Warzone has big stutters on drops.\n\n- What I’ve tried: DDU + fresh drivers, clean Windows install, HAGS/Reflex toggles, RTSS cap at 237, low-latency mode, disabling background apps/services, tuned fan curves. CPU usage ~60–70% across cores, GPU ~70–90% depending on map. RAM at XMP 3200. Temps are fine.\n\n- Upgrade paths I’m considering:\n  1) Platform: 7800X3D + B650 + 32GB DDR5-6000 CL30 (EXPO), keep 3080.\n  2) GPU: 4070 Ti Super or 7900 XTX, keep 5800X.\n  3) Do nothing and wait for next-gen.\n\n- Questions:\n  • OW2 at 1440p low: anyone move from 5800X (or similar Zen 3) to 7800X3D and see clearly better 1% lows/frametimes? Worth the platform cost? Real numbers appreciated.  \n  • If I stay AM4, would pushing RAM to 3600/3733 with tighter timings noticeably help frametimes, or is that marginal vs a platform jump?  \n  • For Warzone, would a 4070 Ti Super on the 5800X smooth out 1% lows, or is it still mostly CPU-limited at my settings?  \n  • B650 motherboard recs with reliable Ethernet/BIOS and good VRMs (no RGB needed)? I’ve seen some DOA LAN/BIOS posts and I’m wary.  \n  • Cooling: is a Peerless Assassin/AK620 sufficient for 7800X3D for quiet, or should I consider a 240mm AIO? Case supports both.  \n  • PSU: is my RM750x enough headroom if I go 7900 XTX later, or should I plan for an 850–1000W upgrade?\n\n- Budget: ~$1,000–$1,200 for CPU+mobo+RAM; ~$900 if GPU only. US-based.\n\n- Goal: smoothest possible frametimes and consistent 237–240 fps at 1440p for comp play; input latency/consistency > average FPS.\n\nAny data points, tuning tips, or specific part recs would be awesome.

  "title: 4070 Super vs 7900 XT for 1440p/240 Hz shooters — latency, frame gen, and VRAM considerations?\n self_text: Looking for real-world advice from folks who play competitive shooters at 1440p/240 Hz. I’m upgrading mainly for Overwatch 2, Warzone, Apex, and Rocket League, with the goal of maintaining the lowest latency and the most stable frame pacing at high refresh. Ray tracing doesn’t matter to me; clarity and responsiveness do.\n\nCurrent setup:\n- CPU: Ryzen 7 5800X3D\n- RAM: 32 GB DDR4-3600 CL16\n- GPU: GTX 1080 Ti (to be replaced)\n- Monitor: 27\" 1440p 240 Hz IPS (Adaptive Sync/FreeSync; no G-Sync module)\n- PSU: Seasonic Focus GX-750 (750 W, Gold)\n- Case/cooling: Good airflow, plenty of fan headroom\n\nShortlist:\n- NVIDIA RTX 4070 Super (12 GB)\n- AMD RX 7900 XT (20 GB)\n\nPriorities/questions:\n- Competitive latency: Planning to disable frame generation for shooters. Any noticeable input latency differences at 1440p between native vs DLSS Quality on the 4070S? How does AMD Anti-Lag (not Anti-Lag+) compare to NVIDIA Reflex in OW2/Warzone?\n- Frame stability: For locking 240 fps (with tuned settings), which card holds frametimes steadier in OW2/Apex/Warzone at 1440p? Anecdotes beat synthetic benches here.\n- VRAM headroom: Is 12 GB on the 4070S proving to be a limiter in current/near-future shooters at 1440p competitive settings, or is 20 GB on the 7900 XT overkill for this use case?\n- Streaming/recording: I occasionally record or stream to YouTube/Twitch. How’s AV1/NVENC vs AV1/AMF in practice at 1440p60 with low bitrates? Any common encoder/driver quirks I should know about?\n- Power/thermals: My 750 W PSU should be fine for either, but any coil whine or hotspot gotchas with popular 7900 XT AIBs vs 4070S AIBs when undervolting?\n- Adaptive Sync: Any flicker or VRR edge cases using a FreeSync monitor with a 40-series NVIDIA card at 240 Hz?\n\nBudget is ~$600–$750. If you’ve moved from a 1080 Ti to either of these cards for high-refresh 1440p shooters, I’d love to hear what made you pick it and whether you’d make the same choice again.\n subreddit: buildapc",
  "title: 1440p/240 Hz upgrade path: stay AM4 (5800X3D + 4070 Ti Super/4080S) or jump to AM5/Intel + 7900 XTX?\n self_text: Looking for advice from folks who’ve chased high FPS at 1440p/240 Hz, especially in eSports shooters.\n\nCurrent rig:\n- CPU: Ryzen 5 5600 (stock)\n- GPU: RTX 3060 Ti\n- RAM: 32 GB DDR4-3600 CL16\n- Mobo: B550 (latest BIOS)\n- PSU: Corsair RM650x (2018)\n- Case/cooling: Meshify C, 2x140 intake, 1x120 exhaust, Scythe Fuma 2\n- Monitor: 27\" 1440p/240 Hz (FreeSync Premium, G-Sync Compatible)\n\nUse:\n- 60% eSports (OW2, Valorant, Apex, CoD, Rocket League)\n- 40% AAA (Cyberpunk 2077, BG3, Starfield occasionally)\n- Priority: consistent 1% lows and low input latency over “max eye candy,” but I’ll toggle RT occasionally in single-player.\n\nBudget: ~$1.2–1.6k for CPU+GPU (+PSU if needed). Would prefer to keep the case and RAM.\n\nPaths I’m considering:\n\nA) Stay on AM4\n- CPU: 5800X3D\n- GPU: RTX 4070 Ti Super (16 GB) or RTX 4080 Super (16 GB)\n- Keep DDR4 and B550\nPros: Easiest, cheapest. 5800X3D seems great for eSports 1% lows. DLSS/Reflex/Frame Gen if I go 40-series.\nCons: Ceiling vs 7800X3D? 4080S on a 650W PSU might be marginal.\n\nB) Platform swap\n- AMD: 7800X3D + B650 + 32 GB DDR5-6000 CL30 + RTX 4080 Super or RX 7900 XTX\n- Intel: i5-13600K/14600K + Z790 + DDR5 + 4080S/7900 XTX\nPros: Best possible CPU-side FPS/frametimes for 240 Hz; more “future-proof.”\nCons: Cost rises fast. 7900 XTX raster is great but I use DLSS/Reflex today; FSR3/Anti-Lag+ isn’t as mature in the games I play.\n\nQuestions:\n1) For 1440p/240 Hz in OW2/Valorant/Apex/CoD, is a 5800X3D “good enough” to reliably hit high 1% lows, or is 7800X3D/13600K noticeably smoother at that framerate?\n2) If staying AM4, is 4070 Ti Super the sweet spot for 1440p/240 Hz eSports + solid AAA, or does the 4080 Super materially improve 1% lows in CPU-heavy shooters and make RT in Cyberpunk/Path Tracing more viable?\n3) PSU: Can my RM650x safely run 5800X3D + 4080S under sustained load, or should I plan for an 850W (e.g., RM850x Shift)? For 7900 XTX I’m assuming 850W minimum.\n4) VRAM considerations: any real-world headroom benefit going 24 GB (7900 XTX) vs 16 GB (4080S/4070 Ti S) at 1440p today, beyond modded Cyberpunk/texture packs?\n5) Input latency: For eSports, does Frame Gen ever make sense at 240 Hz if Reflex is enabled, or should I stick to native frames and use DLSS Quality/FSR Quality only when needed?\n6) Anything obvious I’m missing for case airflow/fan layout to help 1% lows/CPU temps at high refresh?\n\nLeaning toward 5800X3D + 4070 Ti Super to “max out” AM4 for 2–3 years, but I’m open to jumping to 7800X3D if the 1% low uplift at 240 Hz is truly noticeable.

I’ll tune settings for competitive play; frame gen isn’t an option due to latency.\n\nI’m torn between a cheap, high-impact AM4 upgrade versus a full platform swap, and which GPU pairs best for consistent 240 Hz at 1440p.\n\nQuestions:\n1) CPU path: How big is the real-world uplift going from 5800X → 5800X3D in OW/Valorant/CoD at 1440p/low-med? Enough to meaningfully smooth 1%/0.1% lows vs my 5800X, or is 7800X3D notably better for frametimes at 240 Hz? If you’ve made this jump, what did your frametime graphs look like?\n2) GPU choice at 1440p/240:\n   - 4070 Ti Super (16 GB): is this sufficient for 240 Hz in OW/Valorant with headroom, and how does it fare in CoD MP/Warzone at competitive settings?\n   - 4080 Super (16 GB): worth the premium for more stable 1% lows and NVENC for occasional streaming?\n   - 7900 XTX (24 GB): big raster + VRAM, but how are current drivers/frametimes in OW/CoD? Any lingering microstutter issues in high-FPS scenarios?\n3) Streaming: If I stick to 1080p60, is NVENC (4080S) still noticeably better than AMD’s AV1/HEVC for clarity at ~8–10 Mbps on Twitch/YouTube, or is it basically a wash now?\n4) Platform longevity vs cost: Is AM5 (7800X3D + B650 + 32 GB DDR5-6000) meaningfully smoother than 5800X3D at 240 Hz today in these titles, or does AM4 still make sense if my sole target is high-FPS competitive?\n\nOptions I’m considering:\n- A) Drop-in 5800X3D + 4080 Super. Keeps costs lower, upgrades CPU bottleneck and frametimes, and gets strong NVENC + better 1% lows than 4070 Ti S.\n- B) Full AM5 (7800X3D + B650 + DDR5-6000) + 4070 Ti Super. Better platform/CPU frametimes, slightly weaker GPU vs 4080S.\n- C) Drop-in 5800X3D + 7900 XTX for max raster/VRAM. Concerned about driver frametime consistency in OW/CoD and streaming quality.\n\nIf you’re running 1440p/240 in these games, I’d love your actual FPS ranges and 1% lows, plus which combo you chose and why. Also curious about CPU/GPU utilization patterns in OW (often CPU-limited) vs CoD (more GPU-heavy). Thanks!\n subreddit: buildapc",

I’m prioritizing 1% lows over peak fps.\n2) GPU: Can a 4070 Ti Super actually sustain 200–240 fps at 1440p on competitive settings in OW2/Valorant/Apex/Warzone, or is the 4080 Super worth the extra ~$300 for tighter lows/headroom? Real-world user numbers appreciated.\n3) RAM: Stick with 6000 CL30 for AM5 stability, or is 6400 CL32 worth it? Any practical reason to jump to 64 GB for these games?\n4) Cooling/noise: Will a top-tier air cooler keep the 7800X3D whisper-quiet in long sessions, or is a 360 AIO meaningfully quieter at similar temps in these airflow cases?\n5) PSU: Is a quality 850 W fine for 7800X3D + 4080 Super transient spikes, or should I go 1000 W for margin? Any 12V-2x6 cable bend gotchas in the North/Meshify compact layouts?\n6) Networking: Any B650 boards to avoid due to 2.5G NIC flakiness? i225/i226 anecdotes seem mixed—what’s been reliable?\n\nPreferences/constraints\n- Low noise at idle and stable 1% lows in-game.\n- Front USB-C, Wi‑Fi 6E, and at least one Gen4 M.2 with a proper heatsink.\n- I’ll tune fan curves and enable EXPO, but I don’t want to babysit the build.\n\nIf you’re running a 1440p/240 setup for these titles, please share your CPU/GPU, settings, and typical fps/1% lows.

RTSS seems most stable but spikes still happen.\n- Latency stack: G-SYNC on (fullscreen+windowed), V-Sync ON in NVCP, OFF in-game. Reflex On+Boost where available. NVCP Low Latency set to Off for Reflex titles, On for others.\n- HAGS On/Off tested (no clear difference). Game Mode On. MPO disabled test (minor/none).\n- Background stuff off (Discord/Geforce overlay/RGB apps). Shader cache cleared. DDU clean install.\n- BIOS: EXPO I stable (Karhu 6000%+). SOC ~1.20 V, VDD 1.35 V. PBO Enabled, CO negative (-15 to -25 per-core stable). CPPC/Preferred Cores On, C-States On.\n\nQuestions for folks who’ve actually nailed this:\n1) Best-practice limiter with G-SYNC for OW2/CoD specifically: RTSS 237 vs in-game cap slightly lower (e.g., 235)? Any reason to prefer driver cap now?\n2) Reflex + Boost vs standard Reflex with a 4080S at 1440p — any measurable frametime difference, or just power draw?\n3) For 7800X3D, is PBO + modest CO still recommended for frametime consistency, or is stock often smoother? Any CO ranges that are “usually good” for eSports loads?\n4) AM5 RAM tuning: is there any point to tweaking FCLK/UCLK beyond 6000 CL30 sync for smoother frametimes, or just keep it simple at 1:1 UCLK/MCLK?\n5) Windows tweaks that aren’t snake oil: Timer resolution tools (ISLC), HPET toggles, core parking, etc. Worth it, or leave stock?\n6) NVCP settings that actually matter here (Low Latency, Max Frame Rate, V-Sync config, VRR behavior) — what’s your proven stack?\n7) Any OW2/CoD graphics settings that disproportionately affect frametime spikes (even if average FPS is high)?\n\nIf you’ve got a known-good recipe for a flat 237 FPS experience on a similar setup, I’d love to copy your stack (BIOS + NVCP + in-game + limiter).

Planning light tuning (PBO + Curve Optimizer around -10 to -20, no all-core OC). Any reason to prefer a 240 AIO over air here beyond aesthetics/top exhaust placement?\n\n3) RAM tuning: Stick with 6000 CL30 1:1? Worth trying 6200–6400 with UCLK 1:2 on AM5 for esports titles, or does it usually worsen latency/instability vs a tight 6000 profile?\n\n4) PSU headroom: Is RM850e sufficient for either GPU with undervolting and several fans/drives, or would you bump to 1000 W for transient spikes/quiet fan curves?\n\nBonus: If you’ve run a Lancool 216, did adding the top 140s as exhaust help CPU/GPU hotspot temps without making the front 160s noisy?

Minimal hassle, keep DDR4 and current board.\n- Platform switch to 7800X3D (~$350–$400 CPU) + B650 board + 32 GB DDR5-6000 CL30. Higher cost, but best-in-class gaming CPU.\n\nQuestions for folks who’ve actually made these moves:\n- 5600X -> 5800X3D: What were your real-world gains in OW2/Valorant/Apex/Warzone/Tarkov? Specifically 1%/0.1% lows and perceived input responsiveness. Any BIOS gotchas or curve optimizer/eco mode tips for quieter operation?\n- 5600X -> 7800X3D (full platform): How big was the jump vs 5800X3D at 1440p/240 Hz? Worth the DDR5/mobo cost for competitive titles, or mostly the same once GPU-bound? Any EXPO stability/SoC voltage tuning advice for clean frametimes?\n- Cooling: Is NH-D15 plenty for both chips under high, sustained FPS targets? Prefer to avoid AIO if possible.\n\nI’ll likely keep the 3080 for now and maybe go 4080S/7900 XTX later.

I also play single-player stuff (Persona, etc.), but the build is aimed at multiplayer.\n\nBudget/ideas:\n- GPU-only route (~$1,000–$1,200): Keep 5800X3D and jump to 4080 Super (or 7900 XTX if that’s better for raw 1440p raster and 1% lows).\n- Platform jump (~$1,500–$1,700): Move to 7800X3D + AM5 board + 32–64 GB DDR5, pair with 4070 Ti Super (or stretch to 4080 Super if it’s meaningfully better for CoD/OW2).\n- PSU is 850 W; I believe that’s fine for 4080S/7900XTX, but please confirm.\n\nQuestions:\n1) At 1440p/240 Hz in OW2/CoD/RL, will I actually feel a consistent 1% low/latency improvement by going from 5800X3D to 7800X3D, or is the 5800X3D “good enough” and I should just throw budget at the GPU?\n2) 4080 Super vs 7900 XTX for these titles at 240 Hz on competitive settings—any real-world 1% low/latency differences you’ve seen? I’m aware of Reflex/Frame Gen on Nvidia vs Anti-Lag 2/FSR on AMD.\n3) CoD seems VRAM-hungry—am I hitting a wall on the 3080’s 10 GB at 1440p even on low textures? Would 16 GB+ materially smooth out stutter in Warzone/MW3?\n4) Display considerations: any DP 1.4/DSC gotchas running 1440p 240 Hz with full color?\n5) Anything else I should tune first (RAM timings/gear, ReBAR, driver settings like Reflex/Low Latency Mode, BIOS updates) before dropping cash?\n\nIf you’ve made this jump recently (5800X3D -> 7800X3D, or 3080 -> 4080S/7900XTX) and play the same games, I’d love your frame-time graphs and what actually felt better in matches.

  "title: 7800X3D + DDR5-6000 EXPO stutters on ASUS B650 — what SoC/VDDIO/IMC voltages are you running safely?\n self_text: Looking for some AM5 memory tuning sanity checks from folks on ASUS B650 who’ve dialed in DDR5-6000 for frametime stability.\n\nSpecs:\n- CPU: Ryzen 7 7800X3D\n- Motherboard: ASUS TUF Gaming B650-Plus WiFi (latest BIOS, AGESA 1.1.0.x)\n- RAM: 2x16GB G.Skill DDR5-6000 CL30 (EXPO)\n- GPU: RTX 4070 Ti Super\n- PSU: Corsair RMx 750\n- OS: Windows 11, latest chipset + GPU drivers\n\nSymptoms:\n- With EXPO I/II enabled (6000 MT/s), I get random micro-stutters in Overwatch 2 and Rocket League despite high FPS; occasionally see WHEA-Logger 18 corrected errors.\n- HWiNFO shows SoC spiking to ~1.34–1.38 V on “Auto” with EXPO.\n- MemTest86 passes, OCCT memory test passes, Karhu RAMTest 4000%+ no errors. Stutters persist only in games.\n- At JEDEC 4800, frametimes are butter-smooth and no WHEA.\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n- Manual SoC 1.20 V; also tried 1.25 V. (ASUS “CPU SoC Voltage” Override, not Offset)\n- VDD/VDDQ 1.35 V (per kit), Memory Controller VDDIO 1.20 → 1.25 V\n- UCLK=MCLK at 3000, FCLK 2000 (also tested 2033)\n- Gear Down Mode ON, Power Down ON, MCR ON/OFF (both ways), PBO OFF\n- Slightly looser profile at 6200 CL32 seems OK, but I’d like 6000 CL30 stable with clean frametimes.\n\nQuestions for ASUS B650 + 7800X3D owners running 6000:\n1) What’s your 24/7 SoC sweet spot? Is 1.20–1.25 V the realistic target for stability and longevity? Anyone stable lower?\n2) What IMC/VDDIO are you using? Is 1.20 V enough for 6000 on 2x16, or do you find 1.25 V necessary?\n3) On ASUS boards, does setting a manual SoC “Override” truly cap under load, or are you seeing overshoot in HWiNFO? Any benefit to using “Offset” instead?\n4) FCLK best practice: lock at 2000 or push 2033 only if fully error-free? Any frametime benefit one way or the other?\n5) MCR and Power Down on AM5 in 2025: are you leaving both ON for faster boots and stable sleep/wake, or does MCR still cause weirdness?\n6) Any specific ASUS BIOS toggles I should watch (e.g., “High DRAM Voltage Mode,” “Current Capability” for SoC, etc.) that affect transient stability but don’t cook the IMC?\n7) If you solved stutters without errors in stress tests, what ended up being the fix—SoC cap, IMC bump, FCLK tweak, or simply relaxing tRFC/tFAW?\n\nGoal is smooth 1440p/240 gameplay with consistent frametimes rather than chasing max memtest throughput.

I care more about latency and frame consistency than ultra visuals.\n\nCurrent rig:\n- CPU: Ryzen 5 3600 (AM4)\n- GPU: RTX 2070\n- RAM: 16 GB (2x8) 3200 C16\n- Storage: 1 TB SATA SSD + 1 TB HDD\n- PSU: Seasonic Focus 650W Gold\n- Monitor: 27\" 1440p/240 Hz G-Sync Compatible\n\nTwo upgrade paths I’m weighing:\n\n1) AM4 stretch:\n- Drop-in 5800X3D\n- 32 GB (2x16) 3600 C16\n- GPU: RTX 4070 Ti Super\n- Possibly add a 2 TB NVMe (PCIe 4.0)\n- Keep the 650W PSU and current air cooler (Noctua U12S)\nPros: Cheapest, easy swap, great gaming CPU. Cons: Dead platform.\n\n2) AM5 jump:\n- 7800X3D\n- B650 board\n- 32 GB (2x16) DDR5-6000 CL30–36\n- GPU: RTX 4080 Super (or still 4070 Ti Super?)\n- New NVMe, reuse cooler with AM5 kit\n- Likely bump PSU to 850W\nPros: Best 1% lows + upgrade runway. Cons: Costs a lot more.\n\nQuestions:\n- Real-world players: Are you actually holding 240 fps with a 5800X3D + 4070 Ti Super at 1440p low in OW2/Apex/CoD? How are your 1% lows in team fights/smokes?\n- Is the 7800X3D’s uplift meaningfully noticeable for frame floor/latency at 240 Hz, or mostly benchmark candy at 1440p?\n- PSU sanity check: 650W okay for 5800X3D + 4070 Ti Super? For 7800X3D + 4080 Super, is 850W the right call?\n- Any B550/B650 board recs that are trouble-free (no weird DOA Ethernet/XMP quirks)?\n\nIf you were trying to maximize smoothness-per-dollar for shooters today, which path would you pick and why?\n subreddit: buildapc",

  "title: 1440p/240Hz competitive — 4070 Ti Super vs 7900 XTX from a 3070 (on 5800X3D). Is a PSU swap worth it?\n self_text: Current rig:\n- CPU: Ryzen 7 5800X3D (No OC)\n- GPU: RTX 3070 (2-fan AIB)\n- RAM: 32 GB DDR4-3600 CL16\n- Mobo: B550 (latest BIOS)\n- PSU: Corsair RM650x (2018)\n- Case: Fractal Meshify C (GPU clearance ~315 mm)\n- Monitor: 27\" 1440p 240 Hz G-Sync Compatible\n\nUse case:\n- Competitive first: Overwatch 2, MW3/Warzone, Apex. I care more about consistent 240 Hz and low latency than ultra visuals.\n- I use Reflex now; I don't rely on frame gen in shooters. I also record/stream occasionally (NVENC has been nice).\n\nGoal:\n- Upgrade GPU to lock closer to 240 FPS at 1440p with reasonable settings.\n- Debating RTX 4070 Ti Super (16 GB) vs RX 7900 XTX (24 GB).\n- Budget: ~$800–$900. US.\n\nConcerns/questions:\n1) PSU: Is my RM650x enough for a 7900 XTX without risking transients/OCP trips, or is an 850W upgrade basically mandatory? I’m fine undervolting, but I want plug-and-play reliability for comp matches.\n2) Latency stack: For OW2/CoD, does 4070 Ti Super + Reflex generally deliver lower end-to-end latency than 7900 XTX with Anti-Lag/FSR3, assuming no frame gen? Any recent data points?\n3) VRAM headroom: At 1440p high/competitive settings, is 16 GB on 4070 Ti Super totally fine for CoD’s texture cache now and the next 2–3 years, or is 24 GB on XTX a meaningful hedge?\n4) Frame gen: I don’t plan to use it in shooters, but for single-player titles, DLSS 3 FG vs FSR 3 FG — any stability/input feel differences I should know about on these cards?\n5) Fit/noise/thermals: Meshify C has ~315 mm GPU clearance. Many 7900 XTX AIBs seem longer/thicker. Any specific 4070 Ti Super or 7900 XTX models that fit well and don’t turn into a leaf blower?\n6) Value angle: If I stay on AM4 for another year, is 4070 Ti Super the “sane” drop-in (no PSU change, Reflex, decent AV1 NVENC), or is the raw raster of a 7900 XTX worth the PSU + potential case compromise for my use?\n\nWhat I’m thinking:\n- 4070 Ti Super = safer with my 650W, Reflex, DLSS, good streaming, likely fits the Meshify C.\n- 7900 XTX = more raster + VRAM, but probably needs an 850W and a bigger card, and I lose Reflex/DLSS 3 ecosystem advantages I actually use.\n\nWould love real-world experiences from folks who upgraded from a 3070 on a 5800X3D for 1440p/240 Hz shooters. If you were me, which card would you pick, and would you also budget for a PSU upgrade?\n subreddit: buildapc",

I’m trying to maximize 1% lows/latency for OW2/Apex/Valorant/RL/Fortnite (plus occasional Tarkov), mostly on low/comp settings. No interest in RT; motion clarity and input latency are king.\n\nCurrent rig:\n- CPU: Ryzen 5 5600X\n- GPU: RTX 3080 10 GB\n- RAM: 16 GB (2x8) DDR4-3600 CL16\n- Mobo: B550 (has good VRM, latest BIOS)\n- Storage: 1 TB NVMe + 2 TB SATA SSD\n- PSU: 850W Gold\n- Cooler: NH-D15\n- Monitor: 27\" 1440p 240 Hz (G-Sync Compatible)\n- Case airflow is solid (2 front intake, 1 rear, 2 top exhaust)\n\nBudget: $600–$1,000 (USA). I’m fine buying used if it’s a slam dunk. I don’t stream often, but I do record clips (NVENC is nice-to-have).\n\nPaths I’m considering:\n- Cheapest, CPU-focused: Drop-in Ryzen 7 5800X3D + bump RAM to 32 GB (2x16) DDR4-3600. Keep the 3080.\n- Platform jump: AM5 (Ryzen 7 7800X3D + B650 + 32 GB DDR5-6000 EXPO). Keep the 3080 for now; upgrade GPU later.\n- GPU-first: Keep 5600X for the moment, swap GPU to either RTX 4070 Super or RX 7900 XTX for more headroom and better lows at 1440p, then do CPU later.\n\nQuestions for people who’ve tested similar setups:\n- In OW2/Apex/Valorant at 1440p low/comp, can a 5800X3D + 3080 reliably sustain near-240 fps with strong 1% lows, or do I need a 7800X3D to really lock it?\n- If I stay on AM4 now, is there any real-world downside for my use case vs going AM5 (ignoring future upgrade room)?\n- 4070 Super vs 3080 for 1440p competitive: is there a tangible 1% low/latency uplift, or is it mostly a wash unless I go 7900 XTX (and even then, CPU-bound in esports)?\n- For Tarkov specifically, does 5800X3D meaningfully smooth out stutters vs 5600X at 1440p, or is it still going to be engine-limited no matter what?\n- Bonus: Any RAM advice for AM4 (DRAM voltage/XMP/IF sweet spot) to squeeze a bit more 1% low performance?\n\nI’m leaning 5800X3D + 32 GB DDR4 as the value play now, then reevaluate GPU later this year. But if 7800X3D is night-and-day for 1% lows at 1440p/240, I’ll bite the bullet. Would love actual frame data or anecdotes from folks who made these exact moves. Thanks!\n subreddit: r/buildapc"
