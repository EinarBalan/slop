Is GPU-first still the best move for my target fps?\n- 5800X3D on B450 Tomahawk non-MAX: how painful is the BIOS update, and is it stable afterward?\n- Best bang-for-buck 1440p high (no RT) GPU right now: RX 6800/6800 XT vs 7700 XT vs RTX 4070 (considering VRAM/FSR/DLSS)?\n- Is my EVGA G2 650W still fine for 6800/4070, or should I proactively replace it due to age?\n- Any specific RAM kits (DDR4-3600) or AM5 boards/RAM (DDR5-6000 EXPO) to target/avoid?\n- Worth waiting for holiday/MicroCenter combos, or are current prices already decent?\n\nOpen to used GPU/CPU if it’s a smart value. Appreciate any guidance on the best upgrade order for my goals.\nsubreddit: buildapc",
  "title: Should I sell vested RSUs to pay off a 6.9% car loan or keep investing?\nself_text: US (HCOL), 29, salaried W2. Base $150k + ~10% bonus + ~$40k/yr RSUs (quarterly vest). I have a 6-month emergency fund (~$25k), contribute 10% to 401k (4% match), and about $15k in a taxable brokerage (mostly total market index). No other debt besides a car loan: $19k balance at 6.9% APR, $375/mo payment, 48 months left.\n\nI just had ~$8k in RSUs vest and another ~$10k vests in February. I usually sell to diversify, but with rates up I’m wondering if I should use this (and future vests) to aggressively pay down or even pay off the car.\n\nConsiderations:\n- I know RSUs are taxed as ordinary income at vest; selling immediately means little/no cap gains. If I hold and it moves, I’ll have ST/LT gains on the difference.\n- Job stability is decent but not guaranteed. I can cover emergencies without touching RSUs if I keep my current EF intact.\n- High-yield savings is ~4–5% right now, still below the car APR.\n- I haven’t maxed Roth IRA yet for this year (could do so if I don’t throw everything at the car).\n\nQuestions:\n- Would you sell the RSUs now to lump-sum the car (or at least principal-curtail), or keep selling and DCA into index funds while paying the car as scheduled?\n- Any downside to paying off the car early beyond reduced liquidity (credit score impact, insurance, etc.)?\n- Is there a better order of operations here (e.g., max Roth IRA first, then car, or vice versa)?\n- Worth attempting a refinance in today’s market, or unlikely to beat 6.9%?\n\nThanks for any guidance—trying to balance concentration risk (company stock) versus the guaranteed 6.9% by killing this loan.\nsubreddit: personalfinance",
  "title: Where to park £25k for 12–18 months for a house deposit? Premium Bonds vs easy-access vs fixed?\n self_text: Partner (27) and I (28) are aiming to buy late 2024/early 2025 (so roughly 12–18 months). We’ve got ~£25k earmarked for a deposit currently sitting in a current account earning peanuts. Looking for the best low-risk place to park it without risking the timeline.\n\nQuick facts:\n- Basic rate taxpayers, combined income ~£80k\n- No debt, emergency fund ~6 months (kept separate)\n- Both first-time buyers\n- No LISAs yet (but can open Cash LISAs now)\n\nOptions we’re considering:\n1) Cash LISA(s): If we open now, my understanding is the 12-month clock starts from the account opening date (or first contribution?). Plan would be to put £4k each in before 5 April, then £4k each again next tax year to get the 25% bonus. If completion ends up <12 months away, the 25% penalty is nasty—so is the safest approach to only put in what we’re sure we won’t need before the 12-month mark?\n\n2) Easy-access savings: Plenty around ~5% gross. Offers flexibility if timelines shift. Any standout providers or pitfalls for short-term house deposit money?\n\n3) 1-year fixed: Seeing ~5.6–6% for 12 months. Concern is early withdrawal penalties if the purchase happens a bit earlier/later than expected. Sensible to split (e.g., a chunk fixed for 12 months + rest easy-access)?\n\n4) Premium Bonds: Current prize rate roughly comparable to decent easy access (varies). Worth it for capital security + instant access, or statistically worse than the best easy-access rates?\n\nTax angle:\n- With ~£25k at ~5%, interest is ~£1,250/yr. We could split across joint/individual accounts to use both Personal Savings Allowances (£1k each) and keep it tax-free. Does that sound right?\n- LISA bonus/interest are tax-free anyway.\n\nQuestions:\n- Does the LISA 12-month clock start on account opening or first contribution?\n- For a 12–18 month horizon, is a mix (some 1-year fixed + some easy-access) the most sensible?\n- Any reason Premium Bonds would be preferable to a top easy-access for this timeframe?\n- Any other gotchas when storing deposit funds (provider limits, FSCS, joint vs individual accounts, etc.)?\n\nThanks!\n subreddit: UKPersonalFinance",
  "title: 4070 Super with Ryzen 5 5600 @1440p — upgrade GPU now or go 5800X3D first?\nself_text: Hey all, trying to plan my next step without wasting money. Current rig:\n\n- CPU: Ryzen 5 5600 (stock, Arctic Freezer 34)\n- Mobo: MSI B550 Tomahawk\n- RAM: 16GB (2x8) 3200 CL16 — can add another 16GB if needed\n- GPU: GTX 1070\n- PSU: Corsair RM650x (2019) 650W Gold\n- Case: Phanteks P400A (2x140mm front intake, 1x120mm rear exhaust)\n- Storage: 1TB NVMe + 1TB SATA SSD\n- Monitor: 1440p 165Hz\n\nUse case/games: Apex, Elden Ring, Cyberpunk 2077, Starfield, BG3. I’d like high/ultra-ish at 1440p, DLSS/FSR is fine, not chasing max RT but would like some RT in Cyberpunk if possible.\n\nI’m eyeing an RTX 4070 Super, but also seeing decent deals on used 6800 XT/6900 XT. Budget is ~$600–700 for GPU. I could also snag a 5800X3D for ~$250 later if that’s the smarter order.\n\nQuestions:\n- Will my 5600 meaningfully bottleneck a 4070 Super at 1440p in those games, or is it “good enough” until I move to a 5800X3D?\n- Is the RM650x sufficient for a 4070 Super (no crazy OC, maybe a mild undervolt)?\n- If I skip RT/DLSS, is a 6800 XT/6900 XT the better value at 1440p right now? Any VRAM longevity advantage worth considering?\n- Would you prioritize the 5800X3D first for smoother 1% lows in CPU-heavy titles (Starfield/BG3), or go GPU first?\n- Any airflow/adapter gotchas with the 4070 Super (12VHPWR orientation, clearance) in a P400A?\n\nBonus: I occasionally see micro-stutter in newer titles — is that more likely to be the 16GB RAM ceiling at 1440p, or just the old 1070? Should I jump to 32GB regardless?\n\nThanks!\nsubreddit: buildapc",
  "title: Used RTX 3070 vs new RX 7700 XT for 1440p 144Hz — which makes more sense right now?\n self_text: Trying to pick a GPU upgrade for 1440p 165Hz and could use a sanity check.\n\nCurrent build:\n- CPU: Ryzen 5 5600 (stock)\n- Mobo: B550\n- RAM: 16GB (2x8) 3200 CL16 (can add another 16 or replace with 32 later)\n- GPU: RTX 2060 6GB\n- PSU: Corsair RM650x (650W Gold)\n- Case: Mesh airflow with 5 fans\n- Monitor: 27\" 1440p 165Hz IPS (FreeSync Premium)\n\nUse case:\n- Games: Apex, BG3, Cyberpunk 2077 (no heavy RT), Starfield, modded Skyrim, Elden Ring, indie stuff\n- Light Blender learning, video encode here and there\n- Prefer high settings over Ultra, OK dropping RT or using minimal RT\n\nOptions/prices I can get:\n- Used RTX 3070 8GB for ~$270 (local with box, no receipt)\n- New RX 7700 XT 12GB for ~$430–450 (retail, full warranty)\n- Wild card: used RX 6800 XT 16GB for ~$350 (some with partial warranty)\n\nQuestions:\n1) For 1440p high settings, is the 7700 XT’s extra VRAM (12GB) and newer media engine worth ~$150–180 over a 3070 8GB? I’m worried about 8GB aging out in newer titles/mods at 1440p.\n2) How big is the real-world gap 3070 vs 7700 XT in raster (no RT) at 1440p? Benchmarks look like 7700 XT wins by ~15–25% on average, but curious about Starfield/BG3 specifically.\n3) RT isn’t a priority, but DLSS vs FSR matters: does DLSS Quality on a 3070 outweigh the raw raster and VRAM of a 7700 XT for my use case?\n4) Any bottleneck concerns with a 5600? (I might upgrade to a 5800X3D down the road if it helps 1% lows.)\n5) PSU/cables: I’m fine power-wise for all three, right?\n6) If I go used: best ways to avoid ex-mining lemons? Plan is to stress test (Unigine/3DMark), watch for artifacting, check hotspot/mem junction temps, and verify clocks under load. Anything else?\n7) Would you hold for Black Friday-style dips, or are these already solid prices?\n\nLeaning 7700 XT for longevity (12GB), but the 6800 XT 16GB used is tempting for the VRAM and raster perf if I can find a clean unit.

Is my PSU enough and should I wait for BF?\nself_text: My trusty GTX 1060 6GB is finally artifacting and crashing after 6+ years. I play at 1080p on a 144Hz panel and want high/ultra settings with stable 120+ FPS in most titles.\n\nCurrent build:\n- CPU: i5-9600K (stock, might OC lightly)\n- Cooler: Hyper 212 Black\n- Mobo: Z390 (PCIe 3.0 only)\n- RAM: 16GB (2x8) DDR4-3200\n- PSU: EVGA SuperNOVA G3 550W (80+ Gold, ~5 years old)\n- Case: Meshify C with good airflow\n\nGames I play: Apex, OW2, Valorant, Warzone 2, Cyberpunk, Elden Ring, Baldur’s Gate 3, and some light VR. I also stream to friends occasionally (OBS).\n\nGPU options I’m considering (local prices):\n- RX 6700 XT 12GB for ~$280–$320 used, ~$340–$370 new\n- RTX 3060 Ti 8GB for ~$300–$360 used, ~$380–$420 new\n- Stretch? RTX 3070 8GB around ~$380–$430 used\n\nQuestions:\n1) For 1080p/144Hz, which card is the better value right now? I’m leaning 6700 XT for the extra VRAM and raster performance, but 3060 Ti has DLSS and NVENC for streaming.\n2) Will my 550W G3 be enough for either the 6700 XT or 3060 Ti, especially if I undervolt the AMD card? Or should I budget for a PSU upgrade?\n3) Any concern running these on PCIe 3.0? I’ve read some 8x/4x bandwidth quirks on certain AMD cards—will that matter on a Z390 x16 slot?\n4) Driver/stability reality for current AMD vs NVIDIA at 1080p esports + AAA? I don’t mind tweaking settings, just want fewer headaches.\n5) Worth waiting for Black Friday/Cyber Monday or are the savings usually minimal on these tiers?\n\nBudget is ~$400 max, would prefer to stay closer to $300 if possible.

  "title: Is a 5800X3D drop-in upgrade worth it on my B450 for 1440p?\nself_text: Thinking about a final upgrade on AM4 and would love some advice.\n\nCurrent build:\n- CPU: Ryzen 5 3600\n- Mobo: MSI B450 Tomahawk MAX (original, not MAX II)\n- RAM: 32GB (2x16) DDR4-3200 CL16\n- GPU: RTX 3070\n- PSU: Seasonic Focus 650W Gold\n- Cooler: Thermalright PA120 SE\n- Monitor: 1440p 165Hz\n\nUse case: Mostly gaming (Apex, Warzone, Cyberpunk 2077, Baldur’s Gate 3, Starfield), some light streaming/Discord/Chrome in the background. I’m targeting higher 1% lows and smoother frametimes more than raw average FPS.\n\nQuestions:\n1) 5800X3D vs 5600/5700X: At 1440p with a 3070, will I notice a meaningful uplift in 1% lows/smoothness going straight to 5800X3D, or is a 5600/5700X the better value? I’m okay buying used if it matters.\n2) B450 support: Is my Tomahawk MAX safe for 5800X3D (VRMs/temps), and which BIOS/AGESA should I flash to? Any gotchas with updating BIOS while still on my 3600 first?\n3) Tuning: On B450, can I still use PBO/Curve Optimizer with the 5800X3D, or is it basically leave-it-stock/undervolt-only? Any RAM tweaks (3200→3600) worth it for this chip?\n4) Thermals: Is my PA120 SE enough for 5800X3D, or should I expect higher temps vs my 3600?\n5) Alternative: Would I be better off saving for a GPU bump (e.g., 4070/4070 Super) instead, given I’m on 1440p?\n\nBudget: ~$250–$350 for CPU.

  "title: Coil whine on RX 6800 XT at high FPS — normal or time to RMA?\n self_text: Built a new rig ~2 weeks ago and I’m getting loud coil whine from the GPU area whenever framerates spike (game menus, loading screens, lightweight scenes hitting 400–900 FPS). Capping the frame rate helps a lot, but it’s still noticeable under load in some titles.\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n- Capped global FPS to 165 (monitor refresh), V-Sync on, Enhanced/SmartSync tested\n- Undervolted/underclocked in Adrenalin (stable, temps great)\n- Different PCIe power cables (separate runs), reseated GPU\n- PSU eco mode on/off, tried a different outlet/UPS\n- Case open vs closed, GPU vertical mount test\n- Noise correlates directly with FPS; Cyberpunk at 70–100 FPS = faint, 3DMark/menu = loud\n\nQuestions:\n- Is this just the coil-whine lottery and “within spec,” or worth an RMA while I’m in the return window?\n- Does coil whine tend to “settle” after a burn-in period?\n- Would changing PSUs meaningfully help (current one is reputedly good)? Any point in switching to a different brand/topology?\n- Any other mitigation besides FPS caps/RTSS? Frame limiting is fine, but I’d rather not clamp every single app if there’s a better fix.\n\nBuild:\n- CPU: i7-12700K\n- GPU: Sapphire Nitro+ RX 6800 XT\n- PSU: Corsair RM850x (2021)\n- Mobo: MSI Z690 Tomahawk WiFi\n- Monitor: MSI MAG274QRF-QD (1440p/165Hz)\n- Case: Fractal Meshify C\n\nWould appreciate real-world experiences—did an RMA actually get you a quieter card, or did you end up in the same boat?\n subreddit: pcmasterrace",

Not super picky about RGB, just want quiet and good temps.\n\nParts I’m considering:\n- CPU: Ryzen 7 5800X3D\n- Cooler: Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE or AK620 (whichever is in stock)\n- Motherboard: MSI MAG B550 Tomahawk (or the WiFi version)\n- RAM: 32GB (2x16) DDR4-3600 CL16 (e.g., G.Skill Ripjaws V)\n- GPU: RTX 4070 12GB or RX 6800 XT 16GB (whichever ends up better value this week)\n- Storage: 1TB NVMe (WD SN850X or 980 Pro), maybe add a 2TB SN770 later\n- PSU: Corsair RM750e (2023) 750W Gold\n- Case: Fractal Pop Air or Lian Li Lancool 215/216\n- Case fans: Use included, add 1–2 Arctic P12/P14 if needed\n\nQuestions:\n1) Any compatibility issues or bad pairings here? Will the Peerless Assassin/AK620 be enough for 5800X3D in these cases?\n2) If the B550 Tomahawk ships with an older BIOS, can I use MSI Flash BIOS Button to update without a supported CPU? Anyone done this with a 5800X3D recently?\n3) PSU sizing: Is 750W fine for 5800X3D + 6800 XT, or should I step up to 850W for extra headroom/longevity? (If I go 4070, I assume 750W is plenty.)\n4) For mostly competitive shooters + some AAA (CP2077, Starfield, Elden Ring), would you prioritize the 4070 (DLSS3/Frame Gen/RT efficiency) over 6800 XT (raw raster + VRAM)?\n5) Any better value swaps you’d make this week?

  "title: Salary sacrifice EV vs pension vs ISA for a 40% taxpayer — what’s the smarter move?\nself_text: Looking for some guidance on where my next £250–£300/month should go.\n\nProfile:\n- 34, London, c.£85k salary (40% band), Plan 2 student loan\n- Emergency fund ~6 months\n- Mortgage: 2.1% fix until 2026, LTV ~70%\n- Pension: 6% employee, 6% employer (via salary sacrifice already), pot ~£120k\n- Car: 2014 Honda Civic owned outright; TCO roughly £150/month (insurance, VED, fuel, routine maintenance)\n\nMy employer has just launched an EV salary sacrifice scheme. Example quote: Tesla Model 3 RWD works out around £480/month gross, but post tax/NI/SL savings the hit to take-home is ~£280–£300/month. Includes insurance, servicing, tyres, breakdown. BIK is low but rising (I know it goes 2% → 3% → 4% etc.).\n\nAlternatives for that £280–£300/month:\n- Increase pension via salary sacrifice (avoid 40% tax + 2% NI + reduce SL repayments)\n- Stick it in a S&S ISA\n- Do nothing and keep running the Civic\n\nQuestions:\n1) EV salary sacrifice gotchas: early termination fees (if I leave/redundancy), insurance excesses, fair wear & tear, mileage caps, repair standards, accident downtime, who bears risk if I change jobs mid-lease?\n2) Mortgage/affordability: will lowering gross pay via sacrifice hurt future mortgage multiples (even if I’m saving tax)? Any lender caveats?\n3) Student loan: salary sacrifice reduces Plan 2 repayments — sensible optimisation or penny wise/pound foolish?\n4) Pension vs ISA trade-off: given my rate, is the pension tax relief + NI saving so strong that it beats the ISA’s flexibility, even with the LTA gone and AA at £60k? Any rules of thumb?\n5) EV vs keep-the-banger TCO: anyone have a clean framework to compare all-in EV lease (inc. rising BIK) vs owning an older ICE car when you do ~7–8k miles/year mostly city?\n6) Adjusted Net Income: salary sacrifice can bring ANI down. Worth considering for future HICBC or personal allowance taper avoidance if I approach £100k?\n7) Employer pension: is employer % calculated on pre- or post-sacrifice reference salary? Don’t want to accidentally reduce the match.\n\nPointers to good calculators or checklists appreciated.

I play ~80% Valorant/CS2/Apex, 20% single-player (RDR2, Cyberpunk, BG3). I’m in the US, budget $300–$350 (stretchable a bit if there’s a clear winner).  Questions:  • Can a 6700 XT realistically drive 1080p at a mostly locked 240 FPS in Valorant/CS2/Apex (competitive settings)? Or is it more like 180–200 FPS most of the time?  • For overall experience, is a 27\" 1440p 170Hz IPS the better balance? How big is the “feel” difference between 170Hz vs 240Hz for shooters?  • Desk depth is ~24\". Will a 27\" 1440p be too big at that distance?  • Any model recommendations with good response times/overdrive (minimal overshoot), decent HDR (nice-to-have), and solid build/QC?  Shortlist I’m eyeing:  • 1440p: Gigabyte M27Q/M27Q-P, LG 27GP850/27GR75Q, Dell S2721DGF (if found on sale)  • 1080p: BenQ XL2546K (pricey), Alienware AW2523HF, MSI G251F  Appreciate any first-hand experiences, fps numbers with similar hardware, and which route you’d take given my split of competitive vs casual games.\n subreddit: buildapc",

Specs: - CPU: Ryzen 5 3600 - Motherboard: MSI B450 Tomahawk MAX (latest BIOS) - RAM: 16GB DDR4-3200 - GPU: RTX 3060 - OS: Windows 11 Pro - Storage: SN770 in the M2_1 slot, plus two 2.5\" SATA SSDs on SATA ports 1 and 2  What I’ve tried so far: - Updated BIOS to the latest version - Installed latest AMD chipset drivers - WD Dashboard shows normal temps (around 38–40C idle, ~60C under load) and no throttling - Windows is using the Microsoft NVMe driver (WD doesn’t seem to have a custom one) - BIOS settings for PCIe are on Auto/Gen3 where applicable - Reseated the drive and checked the standoff and screw  A couple questions: - Could the M.2 slot be negotiating at x2 instead of x4 for some reason? Does this board have any lane-sharing weirdness that would drop M.2 to x2 even with NVMe? The manual mentions SATA 5/6 disable with M.2, but I thought that only affects M.2 SATA, not NVMe. - Is there a specific BIOS toggle on this board to force M.2 to x4 mode? I’m not seeing anything obvious. - Is there any reason Windows power plan or write-caching policy would cause a hard cap around 1,800 MB/s? - Anyone with this exact board and a PCIe 3.0 NVMe able to share what speeds you get and any settings you had to change?  Before I start moving SATA cables around or buying an adapter to test in a PCIe slot, I want to make sure I’m not missing a simple BIOS setting or known quirk of the B450 Tomahawk.

Right now:  - Unraid NAS (Ryzen 3600, 32GB RAM, 1x 10TB parity + 3x 10TB data, 1TB NVMe cache) on 1GbE  - Gaming PC (B550 board with 1GbE Realtek)  - ISP router + unmanaged 8-port gigabit switch  - House is pre-wired with Cat5e (longest run ~30m)  - Internet is ~600/20 Mbps  My main use cases: large file transfers to/from NAS, Steam downloads using LAN cache, Plex direct play to a couple TVs, Time Machine backups, and occasional VM/iSCSI testing. I don’t care about faster internet—this would be strictly for LAN speed.  Considering: a 2.5GbE unmanaged switch (5–8 port), a 2.5G NIC for the NAS, and a 2.5G NIC or motherboard upgrade for the PC.  Questions:  - Will Cat5e at ~30m be fine for 2.5GbE?  - Real-world gains: will I actually see ~2–2.3 Gbps for big file copies, or do spinning disks/parity kill that? (I do have an NVMe cache on the NAS.)  - Any gotchas with mixing 1G and 2.5G devices on the same unmanaged switch?  - Jumbo frames worth the hassle here or just leave MTU at 1500?  - Any reason to consider LACP on the NAS vs just one 2.5G link?  - Budget recommendations for reliable 2.5G switches/NICs that don’t run super hot?

I’m trying to decide whether to wipe out my auto loan or keep the cash given a likely home purchase in the next 12–18 months.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- Salary: $95k base, ~5–10% bonus (not guaranteed)\n- Emergency fund: $25k in HYSA at 4.5%\n- Debts:\n  - Auto: $18,400 at 6.9% APR, $395/mo, 48 months left\n  - Federal student loans: $9,800 at 4.75% (standard plan)\n- Retirement: 401k at 8% + 4% employer match; Roth IRA balance ~$10k (no new 2025 contributions yet)\n- Credit cards: $0 carried (PIF monthly)\n- Car value: ~ $23k (CarMax estimate)\n- Monthly surplus (after bills, minimums, and 401k): ~$1,400\n\nGoals:\n- Buy a condo/townhome in 12–18 months, target down payment ~$50k\n- Maintain adequate emergency fund (ideally 6 months)\n- Improve mortgage approval odds (DTI, credit, etc.)\n\nOptions I’m weighing:\n1) Pay off the auto loan now from HYSA. Pros: “Guaranteed” 6.9% saved, lowers DTI and monthly obligations before applying for a mortgage. Cons: HYSA drops from $25k to about $6.6k, which is only ~3 months’ expenses and slows down down-payment savings.\n\n2) Split the difference: put, say, $10k toward the auto loan now, keep ~$15k in HYSA, and continue paying it down faster. Pros: preserve more liquidity while lowering interest. Cons: still paying 6.9% on the remainder.\n\n3) Keep the cash, accelerate payments (e.g., extra $400–$600/mo), and reassess in 6 months. Pros: maintain liquidity for DP and emergencies. Cons: pay more interest overall; DTI stays higher longer.\n\n4) Refinance the auto loan if feasible (my credit ~770), though I’m not sure current auto refi rates will beat 6.9% by much.\n\nQuestions:\n- Given home purchase timing, is the liquidity worth more than the “guaranteed” 6.9% payoff?\n- How much does eliminating a $395/mo car payment realistically help mortgage approval/DTI vs. having a larger cash reserve?\n- Any rule-of-thumb here (e.g., keep 6 months’ expenses liquid, then attack >5% debt)?\n- Would you partially pay down to a comfort EF floor (e.g., keep $15k–$18k liquid) and then snowball the rest?\n\nAppreciate any thoughts on the math and the underwriting angle. subreddit: personalfinance",

  "title: New NVMe SSD not showing up in BIOS or Windows on B550 — what am I missing?\n self_text: Hey all, hoping someone can point out what I’m overlooking.\n\nParts:\n- MSI B550 Tomahawk (non-WiFi)\n- Ryzen 5 5600X\n- RTX 3070\n- 16GB DDR4-3600\n- Boot drive: 500GB SATA SSD (Windows 11)\n- Storage: 2TB SATA HDD\n- New drive: WD Black SN770 1TB (NVMe)\n\nProblem:\n- The SN770 isn’t detected in BIOS or Windows (Disk Management) when installed in either M.2 slot.\n- BIOS shows no NVMe devices, and Windows only sees my SATA SSD/HDD.\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n- Updated BIOS to latest (flashed today).\n- Cleared CMOS.\n- Reseated the NVMe multiple times, tried both M.2_1 (CPU PCIe 4.0) and M.2_2 (chipset PCIe 3.0) with and without heatsinks.\n- Verified standoff/thermal pad aren’t preventing proper contact.\n- Disabled CSM, set PCIe to Auto/Gen3/Gen4 (tried all).\n- Removed all SATA drives (I know M.2_2 shares lanes with SATA 5/6 on this board; I unplugged every SATA port just to be sure).\n- Tried different RAM slots, single stick, etc.\n- Booted a Linux live USB to see if it detects the NVMe—no luck.\n- Put the SN770 in a USB NVMe enclosure—Windows immediately detects it and I can initialize/format it there, so the drive itself seems fine.\n\nQuestions:\n- Is there any MSI BIOS toggle I’m missing to enable M.2/NVMe (RAID mode is off; I don’t need RAID)?\n- Could this be a motherboard M.2 slot power/trace issue even if both slots fail?\n- Anyone with a B550 Tomahawk seen similar behavior with the SN770 specifically?\n- Before I RMA the board, any last-ditch ideas?\n\nThanks in advance—I feel like I’ve ticked all the usual boxes and I’m stumped.\n subreddit: buildapc",
  "title: Cash vs financing a used car when I want to buy a home next year — what’s the smarter move?\nself_text: I need a car soon and I’m torn between paying cash vs financing because I also want to keep my mortgage options open in 12–18 months.\n\nDetails:\n- Age 30, income ~$115k, FICO ~770\n- Emergency fund: 6 months in HYSA (~$20k) at ~4.5%\n- Taxable investments: ~$45k in index funds\n- Retirement: maxing Roth IRA, 8% to 401k\n- No current debt, renting\n- Target car: 2019–2020 Mazda3/Toyota Corolla in the $17k–$20k range (out the door ~ $19k–$22k)\n- Dealer financing offer: 5.9% for 48 months, no prepayment penalty\n\nI can pay cash without touching my full emergency fund, but it would take a big chunk out of what I’m saving for a down payment. Financing keeps more cash on hand, but I’m worried about how an auto loan affects DTI and mortgage approval next year.\n\nQuestions:\n- For someone aiming to buy a home in ~12 months, is it better to pay cash to keep DTI clean, or finance and pay down aggressively?\n- How much does a new auto loan typically hurt mortgage approval/interest rate if I keep the payment modest?\n- Would lenders view it more favorably if I finance now and pay most of it off before applying for a mortgage?\n- Is it smarter to buy a cheaper car (e.g., $8k–$10k) for a year and upgrade after closing?\n\nAny rules of thumb or lender insights appreciated. Trying to balance keeping liquidity for a down payment vs not kneecapping my mortgage options with a new monthly payment.\nsubreddit: personalfinance",
  "title: RX 6800 vs RTX 4070 for 1440p 144Hz on a 5600X—will my 650W PSU be enough?\n self_text: Looking to upgrade from a GTX 1070 for 1440p high refresh. Torn between an RX 6800 (16GB) and an RTX 4070 (12GB). I care about smooth 1440p performance, some light creator stuff, and future-proofing VRAM.\n\nCurrent build:\n- CPU: Ryzen 5 5600X\n- RAM: 16GB (2x8) DDR4-3600 (might go 32GB soon)\n- Mobo: MSI B550 Tomahawk\n- PSU: Corsair RM650x (80+ Gold, 650W)\n- Case: Meshify C with 2x140mm front + 1x120mm rear\n- Monitor: 27\" 1440p 165Hz (FreeSync/G-Sync compatible)\n\nGames: Apex, Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, Baldur’s Gate 3, Starfield (maybe), plus some light Blender renders and Stable Diffusion tinkering. I like high settings and would love 100+ fps where possible.\n\nBudget: $450–$550. I’m seeing 6800s around $430–$480 (used/new) and 4070s around $500–$550 (new).\n\nQuestions:\n1) Will my 5600X bottleneck either card at 1440p high refresh in modern titles?\n2) Is my RM650x enough for both cards (no OC), or should I plan on a PSU upgrade?\n3) Any known fit/thermal issues in a Meshify C with these GPUs?\n4) How are AMD drivers these days for the 6800 in the games I listed?\n5) For long-term usability, is 16GB VRAM (6800) more valuable than DLSS 3/Frame Gen + NVENC/AV1 + CUDA (4070)?\n6) Would waiting for holiday deals meaningfully change the value proposition?\n\nAppreciate any real-world experiences and gotchas before I pull the trigger!\n subreddit: buildapc",
  "title: Is my 650W PSU enough for a 4070 Ti + Ryzen 5600, or should I upgrade?\n self_text: Looking for some sanity checks before I pull the trigger on a GPU upgrade.\n\nCurrent build:\n- CPU: Ryzen 5 5600 (stock, PA120 air cooler)\n- Mobo: MSI B550 Tomahawk\n- RAM: 32GB (2x16) DDR4-3200\n- Storage: 1x NVMe + 2x SATA SSD\n- Case: Meshify C with 2 front/1 rear/1 top fans\n- PSU: EVGA 650W GQ (semi-modular, about 5–6 years old)\n- Current GPU: GTX 1070\n- Monitor: 1440p 165Hz\n\nI’m eyeing an RTX 4070 Ti (or possibly an RX 7800 XT) for 1440p high refresh. From what I’ve read, the 4070 Ti pulls ~285W under gaming loads with modest transients, and the 5600 is ~65W stock, so I should be in the ~400–450W gaming range overall. On paper, a quality 650W should be fine.\n\nQuestions:\n- Is my older EVGA GQ 650W likely to handle transient spikes from a 4070 Ti, or am I asking for random shutdowns under load?\n- The 4070 Ti adapter is usually 2x 8-pin—my PSU has the PCIe connectors for it, but would you still recommend moving to an ATX 3.0/PCIe 5.0 unit (e.g., Corsair RMx (2023), be quiet! Pure Power 12 M, Seasonic Focus GX, Super Flower Leadex) for better transient handling and a native 12VHPWR?\n- If I go 7800 XT instead, is the PSU situation any different in practice?\n- I don’t plan on OC’ing, but I want some headroom and a quiet system—would 750W be the sweet spot or just jump to 850W and forget about it for future upgrades?\n\nAlso: worth waiting for any BF/Cyber Monday deals on PSUs/GPUs, or just buy now?\n\nThanks!\n subreddit: buildapc",

Or does 7800 XT’s raw raster perf + 16GB age better?\n3) For streaming/encoding, is NVENC a big enough advantage to sway me to Nvidia?\n4) Will my 5600X bottleneck either card badly at 1440p? Worth upgrading CPU first/soon?\n5) Is my RM650x sufficient for either GPU? Any specific AIB models to avoid/recommend for noise/temps?\n6) Pricing in my area puts them close: 7800 XT ~$470-500, 4070 Super ~$580-620.

  "title: RTX 4060 vs RX 6700 XT for 1080p144/1440p60 — keep for 3–4 years, which makes more sense?\n self_text: I’m looking to upgrade my GPU and keep it for at least 3–4 years. I mostly play at 1080p 144Hz now, but I might grab a 1440p 75–100Hz monitor in the next year. Trying to decide between an RTX 4060 and an RX 6700 XT (or maybe a 6750 XT if the price is right).  Current build: - CPU: i5-12400F - Mobo: Gigabyte B660M (Resizable BAR supported) - RAM: 16GB DDR4-3200 (can add another 16GB) - PSU: Corsair CX650M (650W, 80+ Bronze) - Case: airflow is decent (2x front intake, 1x rear exhaust) - Monitor: 1080p 144Hz  Use cases: - Single-player and esports (Apex, Valorant, Elden Ring, BG3, Cyberpunk without heavy RT) - Light streaming/recording with OBS - Don’t care much about RT; do care about stable fps and low frametime spikes  Options/prices I’m seeing: - RX 6700 XT new: $280–$320 - RX 6750 XT new: $320–$360 - RTX 4060 new: $300–$330 - (Used) RTX 3060 Ti around $230–$270  Questions: 1) Longevity/VRAM: Is 12GB on the 6700 XT a better long-term bet than the 4060’s 8GB for newer titles at high settings? 2) Encoding: If I stream/record sometimes, is NVENC on the 4060 a big enough win over AMD to sway the decision? 3) Frame gen: Is DLSS 3 (FG) on the 4060 worth it if I don’t play many RT-heavy games? Does it actually help at 1080p/1440p to justify the 8GB tradeoff? 4) Power/thermals: Any issues running a 6700 XT/6750 XT on my CX650M? (I’m fine replacing the PSU later, but would prefer not to.) 5) Driver stability: Any recent driver headaches with the 6700 XT for popular games? 6) “Best value” right now: Is the 6750 XT worth the extra $30–$40 over the 6700 XT? Or is the 4060 still the smarter pick if I care about OBS/NVENC and occasional AI/creator stuff?  Bonus: Any AIBs to avoid for coil whine/thermals? And should I wait for holiday deals or just pull the trigger now?  Thanks!\n subreddit: buildapc"
