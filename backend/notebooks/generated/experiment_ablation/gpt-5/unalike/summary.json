  "title: Can we crowdsource a definitive Love Is Blind timeline per season? Pods length, Mexico dates, move-in windows, weddings, reunions\n self_text: I keep seeing conflicting info from cast interviews and press about how long each phase actually is, and it makes it hard to compare seasons or understand why dynamics feel rushed in some cases.\n\nCould we build a community-sourced timeline template and fill it out season by season with citations? Stuff like:\n- Pods: total days; how many days until proposals start; do they keep some couples in pods after the first engagement; when do they get phones back?\n- Mexico trip: exact travel/filming window; how many days together vs group events; any known reshoots or off-days.\n- Move-in/cohabitation: how many days from Mexico return to move-in; length of cohabitation; when do families/friends film; when do they get ring fittings, tux/dress days, bachelor/ette nights.\n- Weddings: date ranges; number of days from move-in to altar; how long producers give for “final conversations” before vows.\n- Reunion/AFTER THE ALTAR: filming dates relative to weddings; gaps between filming and Netflix release; time couples had to keep outcomes secret.\n\nIf you have receipts (interviews, IG posts with dates, court records for marriage licenses, etc.), drop them with season/episode context. Happy to summarize into a clean post once we have enough data. If someone already did this, please link and we can help keep it updated.\n\nBonus: if you were on the show or know production norms, can you clarify whether timelines have changed across seasons or cities (Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Seattle, Charlotte, Houston)? It might explain why some couples felt way more time-crunched than others.\n subreddit: LoveIsBlindOnNetflix",
  "title: Help me sanity-check a quiet 1440p/240Hz build (7800X3D + 4070 Super vs 7900 XT) and AIO vs air cooling\n self_text: Use case:\n- 1440p/240Hz mix of esports (Valorant/Apex/Overwatch) and cinematic AAA (RDR2, Cyberpunk) + some Unreal Engine 5 tinkering.\n- Priorities: low-noise, reliable, minimal maintenance, good temps. US-based. Budget around $1.8k before monitor.\n\nParts draft:\n- CPU: Ryzen 7 7800X3D\n- Cooler: Either Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE / DeepCool AK620, or Arctic Liquid Freezer II 280 AIO\n- Motherboard: MSI B650 Tomahawk WiFi or ASUS TUF B650-Plus WiFi\n- RAM: 32GB (2x16) DDR5-6000 CL30 (Hynix A-die if possible)\n- GPU: Torn between RTX 4070 Super 12GB and RX 7900 XT 20GB\n- Storage: 2TB NVMe Gen4 (SN850X or 990 Pro) + optional 2TB SATA SSD I already own\n- PSU: 850W Gold (Corsair RM850e Shift or Seasonic Focus GX-850)\n- Case: Fractal North, Lancool 216, or 4000D Airflow\n- Fans: Prefer 2x140mm front + 1x120mm rear, add one top exhaust if needed\n\nQuestions:\n1) GPU pick for 1440p/240Hz: Is the 4070 Super the more “balanced” option thanks to DLSS 3.5/Frame Gen and better RT, or is the 7900 XT’s 20GB VRAM a smarter long-term bet (UE5/Lumen/Nanite, high-res textures, mods)? I care more about smoothness and consistency than max RT.\n2) VRAM: For UE5 poking around and AAA at 1440p with high textures, will 12GB bite me in the next 2–3 years, or is it overblown for non-4K use?\n3) Cooling: For a 7800X3D, is a good dual-tower air cooler the better low-noise/low-maintenance choice vs a 280 AIO? I’ve seen AM5 transient temp spikes cause fan/pump hunting—any tips for smoothing curves (higher hysteresis, longer ramp, tying fans to coolant temp if AIO, etc.)? Anyone running fixed pump RPM + gentle fan curve successfully?\n4) Power: 850W seems plenty for either GPU + headroom for undervolts/boosts, right?\n5) Case choice: Between North / 216 / 4000D, which tends to be the quietest with a sane fan curve while keeping a 7900 XT or 4070S happy at 1440p?\n6) Any gotchas on these specific boards/RAM combos for DDR5-6000 EXPO stability? I’d like set-and-forget with a mild CO -10 to -20 if temps allow.\n\nOpen to tweaks if there’s a clearly better value part at this tier. Goal is a quiet, balanced 1440p rig that won’t feel VRAM-limited too soon and won’t drive me nuts with fan/pump ramping. Thanks!\n subreddit: buildapc",
  "title: [Build Help] 1440p/165Hz upgrade path: used 3080 Ti vs 6800 XT now, or wait for 50‑series? Pair with 5800X3D or jump to 7800X3D?\n self_text: Current rig and goals:\n- Monitor: 27\" 1440p/165Hz (mostly competitive FPS + some single‑player like RDR2/CP2077)\n- CPU/Board/RAM: Ryzen 5 5600 + X570 + 32GB DDR4‑3600 CL16\n- GPU: GTX 1080 Ti\n- Storage: 2TB NVMe\n- PSU/Case/Cooling: 650W Gold (Seasonic Focus), Fractal Meshify C, dual front intake + rear exhaust, Noctua air cooler on CPU\n- Priorities: high, stable frametimes at 1440p; low noise (fan ramping drives me nuts); decent RT when it’s worth it; good VRAM headroom; bonus if I get AV1 encode for occasional captures\n\nI’m debating three paths:\n1) Used 3080 Ti (12GB) for ~$400–$450\n2) Used 6800 XT (16GB) for ~$350–$400\n3) Sit tight for a potential 5070/5080 and pay new‑gen tax later\n\nAlso considering a CPU upgrade:\n- Drop‑in 5800X3D (keep AM4), or\n- Full jump to AM5 (7800X3D + B650 + 32GB DDR5)\n\nQuestions:\n- For 1440p high/ultra, is 12GB on the 3080 Ti starting to pinch with heavier RT/textures, or still fine if I’m smart with settings? The 6800 XT’s 16GB is appealing for longevity, but I care about frame pacing and RT too. How’s current driver/frame pacing parity between them in 2025?\n- If I go 5800X3D on AM4 now, will it be “good enough” for the life of either GPU at 1440p, or is it worth biting the bullet for 7800X3D + DDR5 today? I’m trying to avoid a money pit unless AM5 is a clear frametime win.\n- Noise: I prefer staying on air. Is a top‑tier air cooler still the best bet for quiet, or would a 240/280 AIO meaningfully reduce transient ramping on modern CPUs/GPUs? My current annoyance is quick fan rpm spikes with short boosts.\n- PSU: Is 650W Gold adequate for 3080 Ti or 6800 XT with mild undervolts, or should I budget for a 750–850W to avoid transient spike issues?\n- Any gotchas with used 3080 Ti (coil whine, memory temps) vs 6800 XT (hotspot behavior)? Safe, practical undervolt targets you’ve had luck with for noise/efficiency?\n\nBudget:\n- GPU: $350–$450 used\n- If AM5: ~$650–$800 for CPU/board/RAM\n- Would rather do one big move that feels balanced than chase small gains\n\nUse cases include Apex/Valorant/Fortnite (competitive settings, want 165Hz+), plus single‑player eye candy where I’ll accept 90–120 fps with strong frametimes. I’m comfortable tuning curves/undervolt; just want the smartest value path. What would you do in my shoes?\n subreddit: buildapc",
  "title: AIO fans keep ramping at idle on my 7800X3D — switch to air or fix with curves?\n self_text: Running a 7800X3D + RTX 3080 Ti on an ASUS B650E-Plus with a 240 mm AIO (Arctic LF II 240) in a Lancool 216. At desktop, the radiator fans and sometimes the pump surge for 2–3 seconds every minute or two, even when just browsing. CPU temps spike from ~38 C to ~55 C and back, which lines up with brief EDC bursts. I’ve tried: Windows Balanced with min processor state 5%, pump fixed at ~70%, custom fan curve tied to CPU temp with long step-up/step-down, disabling background updaters/telemetry, and light CO undervolt. Still spiky. I know the real fix is to base radiator fans on coolant temp or at least a slower-moving sensor, but this AIO doesn’t expose coolant temp to the motherboard. On ASUS, is there a sane way to tie the rad fans to CPU Socket/VRM/T_Sensor instead of Tctl/Tdie, and set hysteresis so ramps smooth out? Any recommended values for step-up/step-down or hysteresis that have worked for you on X3D chips? Alternatively, if I ditch the AIO, would a dual-tower air cooler like the Fuma 3, Peerless Assassin 120 SE, or AK620 give me a noticeably smoother, near-silent idle without the micro-ramps on these spiky Zen 4 temps? Looking for BIOS-level tips or first-hand experiences from folks who tamed this without sacrificing boost behavior.\n subreddit: buildapc",
  "title: Are the reunion timelines letting people off the hook? Proposal for a true 6‑month accountability check‑in\n self_text: Hot take: the current reunion/After the Altar cadence almost guarantees we never get meaningful accountability or growth arcs on screen.\n\n- The reunion is usually filmed very close to weddings and before the cast has even seen the edit or the full public reaction. So we get lots of “that’s not how it happened,” defensiveness, and half‑processed feelings.\n- After the Altar shows up months later, but it’s more vibes than substance: staged events, little context, and very selective follow‑ups on the season’s biggest issues.\n\nWhat if Netflix added a transparent, timestamped “6‑Month Check‑In” (and maybe a 12‑Month mini) with a clear format?\n\n- On-screen disclosure of filming dates so timelines aren’t ambiguous.\n- Confirm the cast has watched the full season plus the reunion before filming the check‑in.\n- Neutral facilitator (licensed therapist/mediator) doing one‑on‑ones and small group sessions, not just a host lobbing questions.\n- Standardized questions for each couple/situation so it’s not just who’s trending: “What did you learn?”, “What would you own/apologize for now?”, “What changed after watching the edit and hearing feedback?”\n- Limited, curated receipts allowed (texts/DMs) with privacy safeguards, verified by production ahead of time so we avoid “he said, she said” spirals while protecting non‑participants.\n- Brief status updates on all major storylines, not only the pairings that said “I do.”\n\nBenefits:\n- Gives space for genuine reflection after the initial adrenaline dump.\n- Reduces Reddit/IG detective work because the show itself contextualizes off‑camera developments.\n- Encourages healthier discourse: viewers can see growth or persistent patterns with time, not just reunion defensiveness.\n\nQuestions for y’all:\n- Would NDAs/production realities make this impossible, or is it a matter of priorities?\n- Do you think this would actually reduce online pile‑ons, or just shift them?\n- Which couples from S6 do you think would look meaningfully different at a 6‑month check‑in?\n\nCurious if others are craving this kind of structure, or if I’m overestimating how much accountability a reality show can (or should) aim for.\n subreddit: LoveIsBlindOnNetflix",
  "title: S6 timeline detective work: When exactly did pods/cohab/weddings happen—and how long before the reunion?\n self_text: I keep seeing people say S6 felt “off,” and I’m wondering how much of that is just the calendar. If we could pin down when pods, Mexico, cohab, and weddings actually happened—and how long the cast had off‑camera to reframe things before the reunion—it might explain a lot of the whiplash and “revisionism.”\n\nWhat we (think we) know from past seasons:\n- The core experiment (pods → Mexico → cohab → weddings) usually spans ~6–8 weeks.\n- The reunion can be months later, sometimes after the internet has already picked sides.\n\nQuestions for S6 specifically (Charlotte):\n- Do we have any hard anchors for pod/cohab/wedding dates? (e.g., haircuts/tattoos visible in episodes vs. later posts, background sports schedules in bars, weather, holiday decor, apartment lease hints, work schedules mentioned on‑camera, etc.)\n- Was the reunion taped close to the premiere or after the season had already been airing? How much time was there for breakups/makeups/PR coaching?\n- For couples like AD/Clay, Chelsea/Jimmy, and Jeramey/Laura/Sarah Ann, are there reliable receipts (public posts, interviews with timestamps) that nail down when major off‑screen shifts happened?\n\nI’d love to crowdsource a living timeline with verifiable sources (screenshots with timestamps, archived stories, press dates). No doxxing—just public, on‑the‑record clues. Also curious: would adding simple date chyrons (“Week 3,” “July 2023”) help the audience follow cause/effect better, or would it make the edit feel too clinical?\n\nDrop your receipts and let’s see if the timeline alone explains some of the reunion backpedals.\n subreddit: LoveIsBlindOnNetflix",
  "title: Can we crowdsource the typical Love Is Blind production timeline (pods → weddings → reunion → After the Altar)?\n self_text: I see a lot of conflicting guesses about when everything is filmed, so I’m trying to map a “typical” LIB schedule across seasons (knowing each season can vary). Here’s my rough sketch—please correct/expand:\n\nProposed filming timeline (very rough):\n- Pods: ~10 days?\n- Mexico/getaway: ~1 week?\n- Back-home apartments + wedding planning: ~3–4 weeks?\n- Weddings: end of week 5–6?\n\nPost-filming:\n- Reunion: filmed how long after weddings? Is it usually taped after the initial drop, or before?\n- After the Altar: roughly 6–12 months after weddings?\n\nSpecific questions:\n1) When are most confessionals shot—during each phase, or is there a big batch of pickups after weddings?\n2) When do cast get phones/socials back (pods vs Mexico vs back home)?\n3) Do families ever get filmed before Mexico, or only after couples return home?\n4) How strict are NDAs about being seen together in public before release?\n5) For “live” reunions, were they truly live or live-to-tape?\n6) Any producer/cast interviews or podcasts that lay this out clearly? Links appreciated.\n\nIf folks can help refine this, I’ll compile a clean season-agnostic timeline summary in the comments for future reference. Thanks!\n subreddit: r/LoveIsBlindOnNetflix",
  "title: AIO fans/pump ramp every 2–3 minutes at idle on 7800X3D even when using water temp as source — what am I missing?\n self_text: I’m chasing down an annoying idle ramp on my radiator fans (and occasional pump blip) every couple minutes, even though I’ve tried to base the curve on liquid temp and added long step-up/down delays. Hoping someone with a similar AM5 setup can sanity-check my approach.\n\nSpecs:\n- CPU: Ryzen 7 7800X3D (stock; also tested Eco 65W, PBO off)\n- Cooler: Arctic Liquid Freezer II 360 (pump on AIO_PUMP, rad fans on CPU_FAN via PWM hub)\n- Mobo: ASUS ROG Strix B650E-F (latest BIOS)\n- Case: Fractal Meshify 2 (2x140 front in, 1x140 rear out)\n- GPU: RX 6800 XT\n- OS: Windows 11\n\nWhat I see:\n- CPU Package idles ~35–40C but does those classic 1–2s spikes to ~55–65C from background tasks.\n- Coolant/water temp sits steady around 28–30C; it barely moves during these spikes.\n- Despite setting the radiator fans to follow water temp with 10–15s step-up/down (and disabling Zero RPM), I still get audible ramp-ups every 2–3 minutes. Pump is set to a mostly fixed curve (tried 60% constant and 100% constant); still hear subtle pitch changes.\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n- BIOS Q-Fan: set fan headers to use T_Sensor/Water In where available, long delays, and gentle curves. Still ramps.\n- Armoury Crate FanXpert: same story. It “saves,” but behavior looks like it’s responding to CPU temp spikes, not water temp.\n- FanControl app + HWiNFO: built a curve off water temp with 10s averaging + hysteresis; better, but I still get periodic blips like something is overriding intermittently.\n- Moved from Balanced to Power Saver, disabled background indexing and Xbox services, tested with OW/Discord/Steam closed. Spikes persist (expected), but coolant remains flat.\n- Updated BIOS/chipset, disabled Fast Startup, ensured no “fan test” features are enabled in vendor software.\n- Tested pump on DC vs PWM; set to constant; still occasional micro-ramp.\n\nHypothesis:\n- Some boards force CPU_FAN to track CPU sensor for safety, ignoring alternate sensor selection or intermittently polling CPU temp at a higher priority. Since my rad fans are on CPU_FAN (via hub), they may be spiking regardless of the water-temp curve. CHA_FAN headers often allow true alternate sensor binding + delays without override.\n\nQuestions:\n1) Has anyone with an ASUS B650E-F actually gotten CPU_FAN to obey water/T_Sensor only, with no CPU-temp override? Or is CPU_FAN always tied to CPU spikes on this board?\n2) If the fix is header routing: is the recommended best practice to move radiator fans to a CHA_FAN header (via hub) and leave CPU_FAN populated by either the pump tach or a dummy fan, then set the CHA_FAN curve to water temp with long delays?\n3) Any specific FanControl setups that mix sensors (e.g., max of water temp and a smoothed CPU package) that avoid audible ramping while still protecting against sustained CPU load?\n4) What step-up/down and hysteresis values have worked for you on 7800X3D to eliminate audible idle ramp while keeping temps in check under bursty loads?\n\nGoal: fans respond to actual heat soak (water temp) with slow, smooth changes, not transient CPU spikes. I’m fine running the pump constant if that’s the quietest route, but I’d like to stop the periodic blips without losing thermal safety.\n\nAppreciate any B650/AM5/AIO-specific tips, especially from folks who tamed this on ASUS boards!\n subreddit: buildapc",
  "title: Help picking a truly lightweight claw mouse with stable wireless (19x9.5 cm hand)\n self_text: I’m chasing a wireless mouse that nails claw/fingertip without going past ~55g and won’t freak out in a crowded 2.4 GHz environment.\n\nHand/Grip:\n- 19 x 9.5 cm\n- Relaxed claw / fingertip hybrid\n- Prefer a slightly taller mid-back hump and narrower waist to “lock” my fingers\n- Medium click force, crisp side buttons placed a bit higher, scroll with defined steps\n\nWhat I’ve used:\n- Zowie S2-C (wired): Shape is fantastic for me, but cable + weight are fatiguing.\n- GPX Superlight 2: Great sensor/weight, but the symmetrical, flatter sides don’t anchor my claw and I mis-press side buttons.\n- Vaxee NP-01 (wired): Comfortable but heavier than I want and cable bothers me.\n- Razer Viper Mini (wired): Shape is close to perfect but it’s just a hair too small and, again, the cable.\n\nRequirements:\n- 2.4 GHz wireless with strong stability (Wi-Fi 6 router ~1 m away, BT headphones, USB 3 hub nearby). I’ll use a short USB 2.0 extension for the dongle if needed.\n- Battery life 50+ hrs at 1k Hz preferred; I don’t need 4k polling.\n- Weight ≤55g ideal (will consider up to ~60g if shape is absolutely perfect).\n- PTFE feet, no creak, decent coating. No holes preferred but I can live with them if everything else is right.\n- Budget: $120–$160.\n\nShortlist (please sanity-check):\n- Razer Viper Mini SE: 49g, shape I like from the wired VM. Concerned about coating wear and long-term switch reliability; are side buttons still a reach for larger thumbs?\n- Pulsar X2H Mini or X2V2 Mini: Higher hump sounds great for claw. How’s QC lately (wobble, clicks, wheel)? Side buttons placement?\n- Lamzu Atlantis Mini: 55g, good hump. I’ve seen reports of wobbly scroll wheels—still an issue? Coating any good for sweaty hands?\n- Ninjutso Sora: 45g and praised for comfort, but is it too flat for a dedicated claw anchor? Side buttons feel/height?\n- G-Wolves Hati S Ace: 49g with holes—still competitive in 2025 for wireless stability/QC? Or dated now?\n- Zowie S2-CW: Dream shape for me… but 72g. For folks who switched from S2 wired, did the weight matter less than expected in real play?\n- Endgame XM2we: Love their clicks/QC, but 63g might be a dealbreaker unless it truly disappears in hand.\n\nQuestions:\n1) For a 19x9.5 relaxed claw/fingertip, which of the above actually “locks in” without forcing excessive curl?\n2) Real-world wireless stability: Pulsar/Lamzu/Ninjutso vs Razer/Logi when using a 1–2 ft USB 2.0 dongle extension? Any interference horror stories next to a Wi-Fi 6 router/USB 3 hub?\n3) Is the Viper Mini SE still the best “small claw” pick, or do X2H Mini / Atlantis Mini outperform it for anchoring and side-button placement?\n4) Any sleeper options sub-55g with a slightly taller mid-back I’m missing?\n5) If I bite the bullet on weight for shape, is the S2-CW worth it, or is a lighter S2-ish wireless likely soon enough to wait?\n\nContext:\n- Games: Valorant (400–800 DPI, 1000 Hz) + Soulslikes\n- Pad: Artisan Zero XSoft XL\n- I prioritize consistency and comfort over spec-sheet extremes.\n\nWould love first-hand comparisons from folks who moved from S2/NP-01 to these wireless picks.

  "title: Looking for durable, comfy closed-backs for e‑drums + digital piano (apartment use) — DT 770 vs K371 vs MDR‑7506?\n self_text: I’m after a practical, long-term pair of headphones mainly for instruments — about 70% electronic drums and 30% digital piano — in an apartment. I’ve used open-backs before and love the natural sound for piano, but I need isolation for sticking/impact and not bugging neighbors.\n\nPriorities\n- Comfort for 2–3 hour sessions (I wear glasses; big head)\n- Durability and easy-to-replace pads/cables (multi‑year use)\n- Closed-back isolation without sweaty ears if possible\n- Fairly neutral/clear for practicing dynamics and timing (not bass-boosted)\n- Wired preferred to avoid latency; wireless only if there’s truly low-latency with a wired fallback\n- Budget: ideally under $200, can stretch to $300 if it’s “buy once, cry once”\n\nSources\n- Roland TD‑17 drum module and Yamaha P‑125 digital piano headphone out (no separate amp right now)\n- Might add an audio interface (Scarlett 2i2) later\n\nWhat I’ve tried\n- Sennheiser HD 558 (open): super comfy and natural for piano, but zero isolation for drums\n- ATH‑M50x: too clampy/peaky for me, fatiguing over time\n- HyperX Cloud: comfy enough, but a bit muddy; build was fine but pads wore quickly\n\nShortlist (tell me if I’m off base)\n- Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro (leaning 80Ω): Comfortable velour, solid isolation/build. Concerned about treble peaks and whether 80Ω is the right impedance for my modules (I assume 250Ω might be too quiet; 32Ω maybe too hot/less controlled?). Replaceable parts are a plus.\n- AKG K371: More neutral/Harman-ish, detachable cable, good extension. I’ve read mixed things about headband/hinge durability on older runs—have recent batches improved? Pads look like they might get warm with glasses.\n- Sony MDR‑7506: Classic studio choice, bright/clear for hearing stick definition. Non‑detachable coiled cable is a downside; comfort/pads might need swapping.\n\nAlso considering: ATH‑M40x (more neutral than M50x but clamp?), Shure SRH840A, Status CB‑1 (cheap/comfortable but durability?), or any “sleeper” closed-back with replaceable velour pads.\n\nQuestions\n1) For DT 770s, is 80Ω the sweet spot straight out of a TD‑17/P‑125? Anyone running 250Ω happily off these sources, or is it too quiet?\n2) Is the K371 durability issue (headband/hinge) still a concern in current production, or mostly solved?\n3) If I keep a cheap open-back around just for piano at quiet hours (e.g., HD 560S), is there a better single closed-back pick specifically for e‑drums, comfort, and durability under $300?\n4) Any closed-back that pairs especially well with e‑drums for impact/attack while staying relatively neutral and not skull-clampy with glasses?\n\nWireless note: I’m fine staying wired to avoid latency, but if there’s a legit low-latency 2.4 GHz option with a wired fallback and good tonality for instruments, I’m open to hearing it (battery life matters, but latency/consistency matters more).\n\nThanks!

  "title: 6800 XT at 1440p/240 Hz: stick with AM4 + 5800X3D or jump to 7800X3D/AM5?\n self_text: Current rig:\n- CPU: Ryzen 5 5600 (stock)\n- GPU: RX 6800 XT\n- RAM: 32 GB DDR4-3600 CL16\n- Mobo: B550\n- PSU: 750W Gold\n- Cooler: Thermalright Peerless Assassin\n- Display: 1440p 240 Hz\n\nUse case:\n- High refresh competitive (Apex, Valorant, Fortnite, Overwatch 2)\n- Heavier single-player (RDR2, Cyberpunk, Starfield)\n- Light Unreal Engine 5 tinkering (editor, shader compiles, packaging small projects)\n- I care a lot about 1% lows and consistent frametimes. Also prefer quiet acoustics (air > AIO; not a fan of pump ramping).\n\nWhat I'm seeing now:\n- In eSports at 1440p competitive settings, I’m often CPU-limited; GPU sits 60–80% with dips, and 1% lows can crater during big fights.\n- In AAA at 1440p High/Ultra, it’s mostly GPU-bound and feels fine, but I’d still like stronger 1% lows.\n\nUpgrade options I’m weighing:\nA) Drop-in 5800X3D on AM4\n- Pros: Simple, cheaper, big uplift in CPU-bound games/1% lows, keeps my current board/RAM/cooler, minimal downtime.\n- Cons: Dead-end platform; not ideal for productivity (lower clocks). Next big CPU upgrade would mean a full platform swap anyway.\n\nB) Full move to AM5 with 7800X3D + B650 + DDR5-6000\n- Pros: Best gaming 1% lows, upgrade path for future Zen, modern I/O, better single-thread than 5800X3D. Likely “set and forget” for years.\n- Cons: Much higher cost, new motherboard/RAM quirks, more setup time. For UE builds, a non-X3D (7700/7900) might actually be better—so is 7800X3D still the right call for my mixed use?\n\nC) Do nothing for now\n- Pros: Save money; maybe undervolt/tune the 6800 XT, tweak game settings, and wait for next GPU/CPU cycle.\n- Cons: Leaves 1440p/240 Hz potential on the table in eSports.\n\nQuestions for folks who’ve been here (especially 6800 XT owners):\n1) Real-world delta at 1440p between 5600 -> 5800X3D vs 5600 -> 7800X3D for eSports. How much did your 1% lows and frametime consistency improve? Worth the extra cost/time of AM5?\n2) If you went 5800X3D first and later jumped to AM5, did you regret the interim step or was it the perfect “bridge” upgrade?\n3) UE5 angle: Did anyone compare 5800X3D vs 7800X3D (or 7700/7900) for editor responsiveness/shader compiles/packaging? Is the cache king here, or do higher clocks/cores help more?\n4) RAM considerations: On AM4 I’m at 32 GB 3600 CL16. On AM5 I’d target 32 GB DDR5-6000 (CL30-ish). In your experience, how much does that memory move the needle for 1% lows at 1440p?\n5) Thermals/acoustics: Is a Peerless Assassin plenty for 5800X3D/7800X3D at sane voltages? I’d like to avoid an AIO if possible.\n6) Any gotchas pairing a 6800 XT with AM5 (SAM/Resizable BAR quirks, board picks, BIOS maturity), or solid B650 recommendations that won’t break the bank?\n\nBudget-wise I can afford AM5, but if 5800X3D gets me 80–90% of the gaming uplift with far less hassle, I’m tempted.

Is that enough for 7900 XTX spikes, or should I step up to 1000W?\n- Case: Lian Li Lancool 216 or Fractal North; airflow plan is front 2x140, top 2x140, rear 120\n- OS: Windows 11\n\nKey questions:\n1) VRAM headroom at 1440p: Anyone hit limits with 16GB on 4070 Ti Super in Cyberpunk/Starfield/RDR2 with high-res textures and some RT? Is the 7900 XTX’s 24GB noticeably safer for the next 2–3 years?\n2) Frame gen and input feel: DLSS 3 FG vs FSR 3/AFMF in practice — any stutter/latency quirks I should know about, especially for shooters (I can disable FG in ranked, just curious).\n3) UE5 editor: For Lumen/HWRT/Nanite play, does NVIDIA behave better in-editor? I know RT perf is weaker on AMD — does that matter for light tinkering (not shipping anything)?\n4) Cooling/noise: Is a Peerless Assassin enough for a 7800X3D in a ~27°C room for quiet gaming, or is a 240 AIO meaningfully better? Any fan curve tips to avoid sudden ramping/pump whine?\n5) Motherboard/BIOS: Tomahawk vs Strix stability for EXPO and sleep/resume?

  "title: AIO radiator fans keep pulsing every ~60s despite a gentle curve — what sensor/curve are you using for stable noise?\n self_text: Short version: my radiator fans ramp up/down every minute or so at idle/low load even though the PWM curve is shallow. It’s driving me nuts. What sensor and smoothing/hysteresis settings are you using to keep AIO noise stable without letting temps spike?\n\nSpecs/setup:\n- CPU: i7-13700K (stock)\n- Mobo: ASUS Z690-A (latest BIOS)\n- Cooler: Arctic Liquid Freezer II 360 (pump fixed 100% on AIO_PUMP)\n- Case: Lian Li Lancool 216\n- Rad fans: 3x PWM on CPU_FAN via PWM hub\n- Case fans: CHA_FAN headers\n- Software: FanControl + HWiNFO; Armoury Crate is installed but can remove\n\nSymptoms:\n- Idle/desktop: CPU package sits ~35–45°C but spikes to 60–70°C for 2–5 seconds periodically (Windows tasks, Discord, telemetry, etc.).\n- Those brief spikes cause the radiator fans to surge, then spin back down, repeating every ~45–90s.\n- In BIOS (Q-Fan), source = CPU, mild curve, tried step-up/step-down time (e.g., 10s/15s). Still pulses.\n- In FanControl, tried moving average and hysteresis. Better, but still audible oscillation.\n\nTried/considering:\n- Tying rad fans to a slower-changing sensor (coolant or radiator exhaust) instead of CPU package.\n- Arctic LF II doesn’t expose coolant temp, so I’m thinking a 10k thermistor on the rad and using T_SENSOR, then a slow curve + 20–30s step-down.\n- Alternatively, basing rad fans on “VRM MOS” or “Motherboard” temp with a ceiling so they still ramp under sustained load.\n- For gaming, mixing sources (max of CPU/GPU) in FanControl so GPU load ramps the rad if needed.\n- Reducing CPU burstiness: Windows “Minimum processor state” to 5%, disabling extra telemetry (Armoury Crate services, iCUE/CAM), slight undervolt, lower PL2. Helps a bit but doesn’t fix the pulse entirely.\n\nQuestions:\n1) If you run an AIO on 12th/13th gen Intel (or similarly spiky Ryzen), what sensor do you base the radiator fans on for stable acoustics?\n2) If you don’t have a coolant sensor, is a T_SENSOR thermistor on the rad/tube + long step-down the best compromise?\n3) Any ASUS-specific Q-Fan settings I’m missing (e.g., advanced hysteresis, “keep fan duty for X seconds,” different “CPU” sensor type) that tame this?\n4) Any downsides to fully decoupling rad fans from CPU package (basing on radiator/coolant) as long as the pump is 100% and overall temps remain safe?\n\nLooking for a setup that keeps idle/desktop whisper quiet, doesn’t chase 2-second spikes, but still responds sensibly under sustained loads.

I know 4070S has DLSS3, better RT, NVENC; 7800 XT has 16GB VRAM, strong raster value. For my mix of games and minimal RT, which yields better 1% lows and fewer frametime spikes?\n2) CPU pairing: Is 7600 + 4070S more sensible than 7800X3D + 7800 XT for overall smoothness? At 1440p does the X3D premium still show up in Fortnite/CPU-heavy scenes, or am I mostly GPU-bound?\n3) Cooler: Will a good dual-tower air cooler keep noise/temps in check vs a 240 AIO at ~150–170W loads? I’ve had AIO ramping quirks before; prefer set-and-forget if thermals are similar.\n4) RAM: Is DDR5-6000 CL30 still the AM5 sweet spot? For 64GB, is 6000 CL32 fine? Any stability gotchas with EXPO on current B650 BIOS (SoC voltage guidance still <1.3V)?\n5) PSU: Is 850W overkill for either GPU today but smart for a future upgrade? Any reason to prefer ATX 3.1 specifically and a native 12V-2x6 for longevity?\n6) AIB models: Any 7800 XT or 4070S variants to avoid for coil whine or weak coolers? I prioritize low noise and minimal sag.\n7) Case: Between North/4000D/CH560, which is the quietest while keeping GPU temps in check? I’m fine adding 2–3 quality 140mm PWM fans.\n\nAlso open to “you could save $X here and not notice” suggestions. Thanks for helping me keep this build sane and balanced.\nsubreddit: buildapc",

  "title: Can we build a book-only chain of custody for the catspaw dagger?\n self_text: Trying to nail down a clean, source-backed timeline for the Valyrian steel dagger with the dragonbone hilt used in the attempt on Bran—book canon only, no show.\n\nMy current understanding (please correct/add exact chapter refs):\n\n- The attempt: The assassin’s blade is described as Valyrian steel with a dragonbone hilt (AGOT, Catelyn/Bran arcs).\n- Littlefinger’s claim: In King’s Landing, LF tells Catelyn it was his dagger, and that Tyrion won it off him on a bet at the Hand’s Tourney (AGOT, Catelyn/Ned in KL). This steers Cat toward seizing Tyrion.\n- Tyrion’s denial: Tyrion later states he never won such a blade from Littlefinger and didn’t place that bet (AGOT, Tyrion at the Eyrie/after, and later conversations).\n- The prevailing theory: The blade actually belonged to Robert, and Joffrey overheard Robert say it would be a mercy to kill the boy—so Joffrey, seeking to please his father, procured the assassin (and possibly the king’s own dagger). Cersei has an internal monologue in AFFC that strongly implies this (AFFC, Cersei POV).\n- Aftermath/location: Cat brings the dagger to KL. Ned has it at some point. After Ned’s fall, I don’t recall a clear, on-page handoff or inventory that traces where the dagger ends up.\n\nQuestions I’d love help with:\n- What are the best exact citations for: (1) Littlefinger’s original claim; (2) Tyrion’s denial; (3) Cersei’s internal monologue about Joffrey; (4) any mention that Robert owned or wore a dragonbone-hilted Valyrian dagger?\n- Do we ever explicitly see the dagger on Robert’s person in AGOT (even a description that matches)?\n- Is there any text that places the dagger after Ned’s arrest—does it reappear in KL, among Lannisters, with Petyr, or is it simply never mentioned again?\n- Are there credible alternative readings (still within book canon) that don’t rely on Joffrey, and how do they deal with Cersei’s POV?\n\nGoal: a concise, chapter-cited chain of custody ending wherever the text last leaves the dagger.

I’m okay loosening timings if it means lower/stabler voltages and less heat.\n\nSymptoms:\n- EXPO I boots fine, passes MemTest86 and TM5 anta777 basic, but I’ll get occasional WHEA-18 events and rare game crashes after long sessions or wake-from-sleep.\n- EXPO II (tighter subs) is less reliable for me with 64GB.\n- At JEDEC (4800), everything is rock solid.\n\nCurrent manual tweaks I’ve tested (trying to stay conservative):\n- DRAM VDD/VDDQ: 1.35–1.38V (kit is rated 1.35V)\n- SoC: board auto wants ~1.25V; I’ve tried locking 1.15–1.20V\n- VDDIO_MEM (MC): 1.10–1.20V\n- VDDP: ~0.95–1.00V\n- FCLK: 2000 (Auto), UCLK=MCLK\n\nQuestions for folks who’ve dialed this in:\n1) What would you consider safe daily ranges for SoC, VDDIO_MEM, and VDDP on AM5, especially with 2x32GB at 6000?\n2) Has locking SoC lower (e.g., ~1.15–1.20V) improved stability for you versus leaving board “Auto” around 1.25V, or did you need a touch more for 64GB?\n3) Are you finding 6000 MT/s realistic for 2x32GB without pushing voltages, or is 5600–5800 the sweet spot for rock-solid stability on 64GB?\n4) Any specific sub-timing tweaks that helped you eliminate wake-from-sleep WHEA errors with high-capacity kits?\n5) For EXPO kits rated 1.35V, is bumping DRAM to ~1.38–1.40V considered fine long-term on AM5, or do you prefer to keep it strictly at spec and adjust controller-side voltages instead?\n\nI’ve read AMD’s guidance about keeping SoC reasonable after the early AM5 voltage issues, but I’d love real-world numbers from people actually dailying 64GB at 6000.

No holes, 2.4 GHz, sub-65g ideal, but I’ll take a better shape over a spec sheet.\n\nWhat I’ve used:\n- Zowie S2 (wired): liked the stability in claw but got some top-hand tension on long sessions.\n- GPW OG: comfy for office, felt a bit too flat on the sides and floaty in micro-adjusts.\n\nShortlist and concerns:\n- Zowie EC2-CW: everyone says the ergo hump supports claw well. Concerned about weight vs modern compacts, and whether the coating/sidewalls feel too slippery when hands get dry.\n- Vaxee XE Wireless: shape sounds promising for relaxed claw with good rear support and neutral sides. I’ve read mixed takes on click weight—any updates from recent batches?\n- Lamzu Atlantis Mini: love the weight/price/perf package. Worried about coating wear and occasional QC chatter (wobble/creak)—are those still a thing in recent runs?\n- Wildcard: Razer Viper V3 Hyperspeed — longer, low shape might fit me, but I don’t want overly flat sides again. How’s the main click consistency and side button feel over time?\n\nPreferences:\n- Main clicks: crisp/tactile, low pre/over-travel. Not super heavy.\n- Scroll: defined but not “brick ratchet.”\n- Sidewalls: minimal inward flare, stable grip for lift-offs.\n- Battery life: 40h+ real-world at 1k. Not chasing 8k.\n\nQuestions:\n1) For 18x9 relaxed claw, which of the three (EC2-CW, XE Wireless, Atlantis Mini) tends to reduce top-hand tension the most over long sessions?\n2) Any first-hand 2024/2025 QC/coating reports on Atlantis Mini vs XE Wireless? Did Lamzu fix early issues?\n3) Is EC2-CW’s weight noticeable in micro-corrections compared to the other two, or does the shape offset it for claw?\n4) If I didn’t love GPW’s flatter sides, is Viper V3 a bad idea, or does it “lock in” better than GPW?\n\nOpen to other no-hole suggestions in this lane (Pulsar X2V2 M?

I’d like high settings and consistent 120–165 fps where possible, willing to tweak.\n\nQuestions:\n- At 1440p, how limiting is 12 GB in 2025 for modern AAA with high-res texture packs and heavier RT? Is it mostly fine with smart settings, or does it bite often?\n- For UE5 editor use, does the extra VRAM on 6800 XT noticeably help with large texture-heavy scenes, or is CPU/SSD more of the bottleneck for shader compiles and iteration?\n- Anyone gone 6800 XT → 4070S or vice versa and can speak to real-world RT/DLSS vs VRAM tradeoffs at 1440p?\n- If I undervolt, which of these ends up quieter under a 300W-ish thermal budget in a mid-tower with decent airflow?\n- Is a clean used 3080 Ti still a solid value play today, or is the 4070S the smarter long-term bet due to features/efficiency?\n\nBudget ballpark is $450–$600 (US).

S2 shape just “disappears” in hand; NP-01 clicks/side buttons feel great. I just want wireless without losing that feel.\n\nWhat I’ve tried (wireless) and why it didn’t stick\n- GPX/GPX2: great weight and reliability, but the hump feels a bit too centered/flat for my claw; side buttons are fine but not as defined as Zowie/Vaxee\n- Razer Viper V2 Pro: clicks are fast but too flat and wide for my finger posture; shape feels a bit too low/flat for me, side buttons a touch squishy\n- Pulsar X2 (medium): narrower sides are good, but the hump position + taper gave me inconsistent ring/pinky anchor\n- Lamzu Atlantis Mini: back flare pushes into my palm; hump height/location throws off my curl\n- HSK Pro 4K: fun, but too small for control in TAC shooters over long sessions\n\nWhat I’m considering\n- Endgame Gear XM2we/XM2w: people say it’s a great “S2-but-wireless” lane. How’s the side-button tactility and main-button stiffness vs Zowie/Vaxee? Any shell or wheel wobble?\n- Zowie EC2-CW: I know it’s ergo (not S/ZA), but some claim it still works for relaxed claw. Worth it for consistency and dock reliability, even if slightly heavier?\n- Razer Cobra Pro: smaller ambi with a bit more hump than V2P. Are the side buttons crisp enough and positioned well for claw?\n- Ninjutso Sora: how’s the side-button placement and click feel for claw? Does the shape give better pinky anchor than GPX?\n- Cooler Master MM712: tempting on paper; how’s long-term QC and click feel for claw users?\n- Any other “S2/ZA-adjacent” wireless I’m missing?\n\nNice-to-haves\n- Sub-75 g\n- Good battery, 2.4 GHz stability; 4K dongle optional but I’m curious if it meaningfully helps in Valorant/OW2\n- Coating that stays grippy when hands get a bit dry\n- Minimal pre/post travel on M1/M2, crisp side buttons with clean separation\n- Wheel with defined steps (not loud)\n\nIf you moved from S2/NP-01 wired to a wireless with a similar claw feel, what worked and why?

Primary use is 1440p/165Hz gaming plus light Unreal Engine 5 tinkering (learning, small prototypes), with occasional OBS recording. I care about smooth frametimes, decent RT when it’s “worth it,” and keeping noise/power sane via undervolting.\n\nCurrent rig:\n- CPU: 5800X3D\n- RAM: 32GB DDR4-3600 CL16\n- PSU: 750W Gold (Corsair)\n- Case: airflow-focused ATX with 3x140mm intake, 2x140mm exhaust\n- Monitor: 27\" 1440p/165Hz FreeSync Premium (G-Sync compatible)\n\nGames: RDR2, BG3, Apex/Overwatch, Cyberpunk 2077 (RT Medium if feasible), Elden Ring, a few UE5 titles (Fortnite, Remnant II). I also want good encoder quality for quick clips.\n\nWhat I’m weighing:\n- VRAM: 12GB (3080 Ti) vs 16GB (6800 XT). Is 12GB starting to pinch at 1440p with high textures in newer titles?\n- Features: DLSS (incl. better upscaling) + NVENC vs FSR 3 + AMD AV1. How’s FSR 3/frame-gen adoption and quality at 1440p today?\n- UE5 dev: Any driver/viewport stutter quirks on either side? Does NVIDIA still have smoother editor experience, or is that outdated info?\n- RT: I know 3080 Ti > 6800 XT for RT. Is that meaningful at 1440p if I keep RT modest?\n- Power/noise: Undervolting results you’ve seen (typical stable mV/clocks for each)? Coil whine experiences on common AIBs?\n- Resale/driver longevity in 2025–2027.\n\nIf you’ve run both at 1440p, I’d love real-world impressions and AIB recs to target/avoid.

I’m torn between three options based on what’s available near me:\n\n- Used RX 6800 XT (16 GB) for ~$350–$400\n- Used RTX 3080 Ti (12 GB) for ~$400–$450\n- New RTX 4070 Super (12 GB) for ~$550–$600\n\nRig: i7-12700K (stock), Z690, 32 GB DDR5-6000, 750W Gold PSU, good airflow. Current GPU is a 1080 Ti. Games: Apex/Valorant (high FPS priority), plus Cyberpunk 2077, RDR2, Baldur’s Gate 3, and some single-player RT curiosity. I don’t stream, but I do occasional captures and might dabble more there.\n\nWhat I’m weighing:\n- VRAM/longevity: 16 GB on 6800 XT is appealing for 1440p textures/mods. Is 12 GB on 3080 Ti/4070S already a limiter in newer titles at 1440p, or still fine with sane settings?\n- Frame generation/RT: 4070S gets DLSS 3/FG and better RT efficiency. Worth the premium if I’d only use FG in single-player (I know it’s a no-go for competitive)?\n- Raster perf vs power: 6800 XT seems strong in raster and cheaper, but RT/feature trade-offs. 3080 Ti feels like “in-between”: good RT for its gen but high power and only 12 GB. Is it the worst of both worlds now?\n- Thermals/noise: I value efficiency. Is the 4070S’s lower power meaningfully quieter/cooler vs a used 3080 Ti/6800 XT in real cases?\n\nBonus questions:\n- Any microstutter/driver quirks at 240 Hz on either vendor I should know about?\n- If you’ve run these at 1440p/240, what did you land on and why?\n- Undervolt success stories: 6800 XT or 3080 Ti undervolted to near-4070S efficiency?\n\nAppreciate any firsthand experiences or “if I were you” takes.

  "title: How do you tame AIO/fan ramping from 1–2s CPU spikes? Using coolant temp helps, but is there a better sensor/curve strategy?\n self_text: System/details:\n- CPU: 7800X3D\n- Board: ASUS B650 (latest BIOS/AGESA)\n- Cooler: 360 AIO (tested Corsair H150i + Arctic LF III)\n- Case: 4000D Airflow (rad top-exhaust), 3× front intake\n- GPU: 6800 XT\n- Fans controlled via motherboard headers (also tried USB controllers)\n\nBehavior: Normal Windows use (opening apps, Discord un/muting, tab switches) causes 1–2s +15–20°C CPU package spikes. If I bind case/rad fans to CPU temp in BIOS (Q-Fan), I get audible whooshing every 10–20 seconds. If I bind to “Motherboard” or “VRM” temps, ramps are smoother but CPU sits hotter under sustained load. I’d like to keep acoustics flat in light use but still ramp reasonably under gaming/render.\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n- BIOS Q-Fan:\n  - CPU fan source = CPU, with long step-up/down times (up 3–5s, down 8–12s). Still chases spikes.\n  - Chassis fans on “T_Sensor” (external probe near rad) helps, but probe lags a lot after load changes.\n- FanControl (app) + HWiNFO:\n  - Pump: fixed 60–70% (quiet, avoids resonance).\n  - AIO fans: curve on “water in” (Corsair sensor) or average of CPU Package with 7–10s smoothing + 3–5°C hysteresis. This is the best so far.\n  - Case fans: front intakes follow max(GPU Hotspot, Coolant) with slow ramps; top/rear follow Coolant.\n- Tuning CPU:\n  - PBO Eco 65W, Curve Optimizer -20 all core. Spikes still happen (just slightly smaller).\n  - Windows Balanced vs High Perf: Balanced reduces constant ramping, spikes still present.\n\nQuestions:\n1) Best practice for sensor sources on AM5 + AIO? Is “Coolant temp for radiator fans + constant pump speed” considered the gold standard, with only minor CPU brief spikes tolerated?\n2) Any ASUS-specific sensor that’s less spiky than CPU Package (e.g., Tdie vs Tctl vs “CPU Socket”) that still reacts fast enough under gaming?\n3) Ideal curve design:\n   - What coolant temp targets do you like for 7800X3D? I’m thinking 28–32°C low, 38–40°C medium, >42°C high.\n   - What step-up/down times keep things smooth without letting heat soak too far?\n4) Mounting:\n   - Top exhaust vs front intake for the rad: front intake lowers CPU temps but increases GPU temps and dust; top exhaust is quieter but warmer coolant. Which gives the smoothest acoustics in your experience?\n5) Is there any long-term downside to letting the CPU briefly touch 80–85°C during spikes if average/coolant stays reasonable? I know X3D chips are sensitive to voltage, but temps themselves should be fine in short bursts, right?\n6) Any hidden ASUS Q-Fan options I should flip (e.g., DC vs PWM misdetection, “Ignore CPU Fan low speed warning,” “Keep Current Duty on boot,” etc.), or is it just better to stay in FanControl and never look back?\n\nBonus: If you’ve solved this with an air cooler instead (e.g., dual-tower + case fans on GPU/coolant logic), did you notice fewer audible ramps in day-to-day?\n\nWould love to hear your curves, sensors, smoothing/hysteresis values, and whether you prioritize CPU temps, coolant temps, or a hybrid. My goal: dead-silent desktop use, smooth ramp in games, no fan yo-yoing.\n subreddit: buildapc",

  "title: 5600X + 6800 XT at 1440p: drop-in 5800X3D now, or jump to AM5 (7800X3D/7700) for mixed gaming + UE5?\n self_text: Looking for a sanity check on upgrade path for a balanced 1440p rig that also does light Unreal Engine 5 dev.\n\nCurrent build:\n- CPU: Ryzen 5 5600X\n- GPU: RX 6800 XT\n- RAM: 32 GB (2x16) DDR4-3600 CL16\n- Mobo: B550 (latest BIOS)\n- Cooler: 240mm AIO\n- Storage: 1 TB NVMe + SATA SSD\n- PSU: 850W Gold\n- Display: 27\" 1440p 165Hz\n\nWhat I do:\n- Gaming at 1440p (FPS and open-world; care about lows/frametimes more than max FPS)\n- Light UE5 learning (Lyra-style projects, lots of PIE, shader comp, occasional packaging)\n- Occasional video encoding\n\nGoals:\n- Smoother frametimes in CPU-bound spots\n- Snappier UE5 editor/builds\n- Keep spend reasonable without painting myself into a corner\n\nPaths I’m weighing:\n1) Drop-in 5800X3D on B550\n- Easiest/cheapest path. I know the 5800X3D shines in gaming, but how “bad” is it for UE5 compile/packaging relative to a 5600X or a 7700/7800X3D? If I mostly care about editor responsiveness and shader comp (not massive builds), is the hit noticeable day to day?\n\n2) Full platform move to AM5 now\n- 7800X3D (or 7700 non-X if I want better non-gaming productivity) + DDR5 6000 CL30 + B650.\n- Worth the cost over 5800X3D for my mix, or is it smarter to ride AM4 one more cycle and move later when I also swap GPU?\n- For UE5: would a 7700/7900 non-3D feel better than 5800X3D in compile times while still being “good enough” in games at 1440p with a 6800 XT?\n\n3) Do nothing on CPU and upgrade GPU first\n- My gut says at 1440p with a 6800 XT, the CPU is the limiter in some titles already. Anyone run 5600X vs 5800X3D vs 7800X3D with a 6800 XT or similar and can speak to frametime improvements?\n\nOther notes:\n- My AIO is fine but I’d be happy to go air (Peerless Assassin, Fuma 3) if I move CPUs; noise matters to me more than RGB.\n- Budget isn’t tiny, but I don’t want to throw money at diminishing returns.\n\nIf you’ve made this exact jump (5600X -> 5800X3D vs AM5) and also touch UE5, I’d love real-world impressions: editor snappiness, shader compile, packaging times, and frametime stability in games.

  "title: AIO fans spike to 100% for 1s every few minutes at idle despite flat temps — what am I missing?\n self_text: Build is rock solid under load, but at idle/light use my 360mm AIO’s radiator fans briefly blast to 100% for about a second every 3–7 minutes, then immediately settle. Temps look normal the whole time.\n\nSpecs:\n- CPU: Ryzen 7 7800X3D (stock)\n- Cooler: DeepCool LT720 360 (pump to AIO_PUMP, 3x rad fans to CPU_FAN via PWM splitter)\n- Mobo: MSI B650 Tomahawk WiFi (latest BIOS)\n- RAM: 32GB DDR5-6000 EXPO\n- GPU: RTX 4070 Ti Super\n- Case: Fractal North (2x 140 front, 1x 120 rear on SYS_FAN headers)\n- OS: Windows 11, HWiNFO64 for monitoring\n\nWhat I see:\n- HWiNFO logs show CPU Tctl/Tdie hovering 33–39°C at idle. No obvious temp spike when the blast happens.\n- CPU Package Power and EDC can blip a bit (typical Ryzen behavior), but not huge.\n- Sometimes the CPU_FAN tach in HWiNFO dips or glitches for one polling interval around the same moment.\n- It happens whether MSI Center is installed or not. I prefer BIOS-only fan control.\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n- Ensured PWM mode (not Auto/DC) for CPU_FAN/SYS_FAN.\n- Set pump to 100% on AIO_PUMP, no curve.\n- Disabled “Fan Stop” on all headers; set a 30–35% minimum duty so fans don’t stall.\n- Added hysteresis/step-up (2–3s) and longer step-down (5–10s) on CPU_FAN.\n- Switched control source between CPU, CPU Socket, and Motherboard/System temp. CPU is most responsive, but the spikes still occur on any source.\n- Uninstalled MSI Center/Armoury Crate/iCUE conflicts; only HWiNFO is running.\n- Moved the rad fans from CPU_FAN splitter to a powered PWM hub on SYS_FAN and mirrored curve: blast still happens.\n- Updated BIOS (AGESA 1.1.7.x), chipset drivers, and ME/AM4 PSP etc.\n\nHypotheses:\n- Tach dropout on the splitter/hub causing a fail-safe full-speed pulse when the board thinks the fan stopped?\n- Polling collision between HWiNFO and the Super I/O that momentarily glitches tach?\n- Using CPU Tctl (which is spiky) as the source without enough smoothing—even with hysteresis?\n- USB selective suspend briefly resetting a USB fan controller (if I use one), defaulting to full speed?\n\nQuestions:\n- On MSI B650, is there a way to choose “CPU Average”/filtered sensor for fan control, or increase tach filtering so brief drops don’t trigger a panic?\n- Anyone fixed this by setting a larger “smoothing” window or using water temp (if available) as the source?\n- Is a single-interval tach drop enough to trigger a 100% pulse on MSI boards? If so, any BIOS setting to ignore 0 RPM for X ms?\n- Would routing one rad fan’s tach alone to CPU_FAN (no splitter tach mix) and powering all fans from a SATA PWM hub help?\n- Any known conflicts with HWiNFO sensor polling on MSI that I should change (e.g., disable EC sensor, increase polling interval)?\n\nGoal:\nKeep the rad fans steady at idle without losing responsive ramp under load. If you’ve solved this on AM5/MSI (or with the LT720), I’d love your exact BIOS fan settings (mode, source, hysteresis/step timings) or wiring topology that stopped the brief full-speed bursts.\n subreddit: r/buildapc",
  "title: AIO fans keep surging at idle on 13700K — how are you all taming Intel temp spikes?\n self_text: Looking for sanity checks/best practices to stop the idle fan “whoosh… quiet… whoosh” cycle on a modern Intel chip.\n\nSpecs:\n- CPU: i7-13700K (stock), Windows 11 23H2 (Balanced plan)\n- Cooler: Arctic Liquid Freezer II 280 (pump on AIO_PUMP at 100%)\n- Mobo: ASUS TUF Z790-Plus WiFi (latest BIOS)\n- RAM: 32GB DDR5-6000 (XMP I)\n- Case: Meshify 2 Compact, 2x front intake, 1x rear exhaust\n- GPU: 3080 Ti\n\nWhat I see:\n- Idle CPU usage ~1–3%, but CPU Package temp spikes from ~38–42C to ~65–75C for 1–2 seconds every ~30–90 seconds.\n- Those spikes cause the radiator fans to surge even with a gentle curve in Q-Fan. I added spin-up/down delays (1.5s/3s) and it helped a bit, but the whoosh is still noticeable and frequent.\n- HWiNFO shows brief Package Power jumps (e.g., 5W to 50–70W) during Windows background tasks (Explorer, WUDFHost, etc.). Normal for these chips, I know, but the acoustics are annoying.\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n- ASUS MCE: Disabled\n- Power limits: PL1 125W / PL2 181W, Tau default\n- Light undervolt: -0.05V IA offset (stable), LLC at default\n- Fan curve: currently tied to CPU temp in BIOS; very shallow between 40–70C, with step-up/down delay\n- Windows tweaks: Background apps minimized, Game Bar/Xbox services off, scheduled tasks trimmed\n- Considered locking E-cores lower or tweaking TVB, but haven’t yet\n\nQuestions:\n1) Best practice: should I tie radiator fans to coolant temp instead of CPU Package temp to avoid reacting to 1–2s spikes? The Arctic doesn’t expose coolant temp on this board. Any good workarounds?\n2) If you’re in the same boat, are you using FanControl (Rem0o) with HWiNFO sensors + a 5–10s moving average to smooth the input? Any recommended sensor source if I don’t have a water temp probe?\n3) Any smarter BIOS-side fixes on ASUS Z790? Fan source = “CPU” vs “CPU Diode” vs “Motherboard” behaves differently; unsure which is best for spike-smoothing. Hysteresis in Q-Fan seems limited.\n4) For 13th-gen specifically, is a modest undervolt + tighter PL2 usually enough to stop the acoustic yo-yo, or do I need to go further (e.g., IA CEP off, tune AC/DC loadline, or cap TVB)?\n5) If you’ve solved this with case airflow changes alone (e.g., more intake, radiator position), did that materially reduce the spike audibility?\n\nGoal is a stable, near-silent idle/desktop without kneecapping performance in games or compiles.

  "title: AIO fans/pump constantly surging on 7800X3D at idle — which sensor should I base the curve on?\n self_text: Specs:\n- CPU: Ryzen 7 7800X3D (stock, PBO off)\n- Cooler: Arctic Liquid Freezer II 240 (pump on AIO_PUMP, rad fans on CPU_FAN via splitter)\n- Mobo: MSI B650 Tomahawk WiFi\n- Case: Lancool 216 (2x140 front, 1x120 rear)\n- GPU: RX 6800 XT\n- OS: Win 11, HWiNFO + FanControl available\n\nIssue:\nAt idle/light tasks (browser, Spotify), CPU temp (Tctl/Tdie) spikes from ~40C to 70C for a second, then drops. Every spike makes the AIO fans and sometimes the pump audibly ramp up and down. It’s not loud, just constantly “whooshing,” which is more annoying than fan speed at load.\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n- BIOS fan curve tied to “CPU” sensor: too twitchy.\n- Tried “CPU Socket”/“Motherboard” sensors: smoother but too slow to react in gaming.\n- FanControl with 5–10 s averaging and hysteresis on Tdie: helps, but still surges on bursty spikes.\n- Fixed pump at 70%: reduces pitch changes but still get fan surges.\n- Using “CPU Package Power” as source: very smooth, but I’m not sure it’s safe for spikes.\n- Can’t easily use coolant temp — this AIO doesn’t expose liquid temp to the motherboard.\n\nQuestions:\n1) For Ryzen 7000, what’s the best practice sensor for AIO radiator fans? Tdie with heavy smoothing, CCD average, or CPU Package Power?\n2) Should I just run the pump at 100% (AIO_PUMP) and control only the rad fans, or keep the pump fixed ~60–70%?\n3) If I stick with Tdie, how much averaging/hysteresis is “safe” without risking rapid heat soak in games?\n4) Any downside to using Package Power as the curve source for fans on this platform?\n5) If I rely on FanControl, is there a failsafe so fans don’t get stuck low if the service crashes, or should I keep a conservative BIOS curve as fallback?\n\nGoal is to stop the constant idle surging while still having fast enough response under load.

Should I expect 5600–5800 as the “practical” target?\n2) On ASUS Z790, which rails matter most for this scenario and what are safe 24/7 ranges? (VDD/VDDQ/TX VDDQ, VCCSA, MC voltage). I want to avoid “more SA” if it’s counterproductive.\n3) Any recommended starting profile for 2x32 (e.g., 5800 CL30 at ~1.40 VDD/VDDQ, TX VDDQ 1.35, SA ~1.00) that tends to be IMC-friendly?\n4) Best stability regimen for memory-heavy workflows: TM5 anta777 extreme + Karhu to X%, HCI, OCCT memory… what would you run and for how long to call it truly stable for UE?\n5) If the IMC just won’t do 6000 with 64GB, would swapping to a single-rank 2x48GB kit actually be easier on the IMC, or is that a lateral move on Intel?\n\nGoal: a quiet, stable 64GB setup without cooking the IMC.

  "title: Looking for a lightweight claw mouse with a taller rear hump (18x9.5 cm hands) — GPX felt too flat; what should I try next?\n self_text: After a month of swapping mice, I'm still hunting for \"the one\" for claw. Details:\n\n- Hand: 18 x 9.5 cm, relaxed claw (curled index/middle), light palm contact on rear hump helps me stabilize micro-corrections.\n- Games: Valorant/CS, Apex, some Overwatch. 800–1200 DPI, 0.35–0.5 m/360.\n- Pad: LGG Saturn Pro (soft), arm aim with wrist micro.\n\nWhat I've tried and how it went:\n- Zowie S2-C (wired): Shape is close, clicks feel great, but weight and cable hold it back for me. Hump feels right, though.\n- Vaxee NP-01S (wired): Liked the flatter sides for control, but hump sits a bit low and clicks are stiffer than I like.\n- G Pro X Superlight: Too flat on top/sides; I end up pinching and losing rear support. Side buttons feel too far forward for my thumb.\n- Razer Viper Mini (wired): Decent control, but front is too low and clicks feel hollow.\n\nWhat I think I want:\n- Weight ≤ 60 g, wireless 2.4 GHz (BT optional).\n- Taller, more rear-biased hump than GPX; closer to S2 but a hair slimmer at the pinch.\n- Neutral/egg shape preferred over super-wide flares; no aggressive grooves.\n- Good primary click tension (not mushy, not stiff), low pre/post travel.\n- Coating with some grip (my hands get a bit dry).\n\nShortlist (tell me if I'm on the right track, and how their humps compare to S2/NP-01S):\n- Pulsar X2 Mini vs X2H Mini\n- Lamzu Atlantis Mini (or OG?)\n- Razer Viper V3 Pro (is the hump tall enough for claw without forcing a flatter grip?)\n- Zaunkoenig M2K/other ultralights if the hump supports claw?\n- Zowie/VAXEE wireless equivalents to S2/NP-01S if you've tried them — curious about weight, coating, and side button placement.\n\nBonus questions:\n- Any claw-friendly shapes with a slightly taller rear that are still under 60 g?\n- Side-by-side shape comparisons or top-down overlays vs S2/NP-01S would be clutch.\n- Are 4 kHz dongles worth it for tac shooters, or is 1 kHz perfectly fine if the shape is right?\n\nBudget: up to ~$150.

  "title: The catspaw dagger in the books: who actually owned it, and how did it get to the assassin?\n self_text: Quick lore question that’s been nagging me as I re‑read AGOT/ASOS. The Valyrian steel/dragonbone dagger used in the attempt on Bran has multiple conflicting origin stories in-text. I’m trying to pin down the most book-plausible ownership chain and where it ends up.\n\nWhat the text gives us:\n- The catspaw claims “the Imp” promised him the reward, pointing toward Tyrion.\n- Littlefinger tells Catelyn the dagger was his, but that he lost it to Tyrion on a wager about a tourney bout (which Tyrion later calls out as impossible/implausible).\n- Tyrion eventually concludes in ASOS that Joffrey likely acted on his own after overhearing Robert say he wished the boy would die, and that Joff supplied the blade—often interpreted as having taken it from Robert/the royal armory.\n\nQuestions for the hive mind:\n1) Is there any explicit line in AGOT/ASOS that directly ties that specific dagger to Robert or the royal armory, beyond Tyrion’s later deduction? Or is the “Robert’s dagger” piece entirely inference?\n2) If Joffrey did take it, what’s the cleanest in-world path? Royal armory -> Joffrey -> catspaw seems straightforward, but could Littlefinger or Varys have been the intermediary (intentionally or not)?\n3) After Catelyn brings the dagger south and Littlefinger “IDs” it, do we ever get a firm location for it again in the books? Does it reappear or is it effectively lost to the narrative?\n4) Are there any solid alternative chains that fit all the textual constraints (timeline, who was where, Littlefinger’s lie, the catspaw’s statement) without requiring show-retcons?\n\nWould love citations if you’ve got them; I know this is well-trod ground, but I’m curious if I’ve missed a line that nails down ownership more firmly than the common Joff/Robert theory.\n subreddit: r/asoiaf",
  "title: A small rubric for reading Mushroom in Fire & Blood (and 3 quick test cases) — does this hold up?\n self_text: I love Mushroom as a character, but “Mushroom lies” vs “Mushroom tells it like it is” isn’t very helpful when trying to sort claims in Fire & Blood. I tried building a quick-and-dirty rubric to weigh his stories. Curious what the sub thinks — poke holes, add criteria, or rerun the tests.\n\nWorking rubric for any specific claim:\n- Cross-source alignment: Do Eustace/Munkun/archmaesters/crown records agree on any core facts, even if motives differ?\n- Incentive to scandalize: Mushroom thrives on bawdy scandal. Does the claim dramatically increase lurid value compared to the minimum facts needed?\n- Access and vantage: Was Mushroom plausibly present, or close to someone who was? Or is he speculating on bedroom or council-chamber privacy he likely didn’t have?\n- Cost of the lie: If false, would contemporaries easily disprove it? High social risk can discipline exaggeration.\n- Physical/logistical plausibility: Does the claim fit timelines, locations, travel speed, ages, and known behavior of the people involved?\n- Narrative economy: Does the claim explain otherwise puzzling reactions/edicts/alliances better than competing accounts?\n\nThree quick test cases\n\n1) Rhaenyra and Criston’s alleged consummation\n- Cross-source: Multiple tellings admit unusual intimacy/tension; details diverge (first night with Criston vs lessons from Daemon, etc.).\n- Incentive: Extremely high; salacious payoff for Mushroom.\n- Access: Mushroom has court proximity but not guaranteed bedroom access.\n- Cost: If blatantly false, plenty at court could contradict, but shame/culture might suppress open denial.\n- Plausibility: Humanly plausible; explains the ferocity of Criston’s later break and his zeal on the Green side.\n- Narrative economy: Helps the “why this bitter” question, but not the only explanation.\nTentative weight: Possible but far from certain; readers’ priors probably drive conclusions more than the evidence.\n\n2) Details around Aemond losing his eye (the pig, “Strong” slur, escalation)\n- Cross-source: Core event is solid across accounts; the insult and chain of provocations vary in color.\n- Incentive: Medium; it’s already sensational without extra spice.\n- Access: Court proximity, lots of witnesses; hard to fabricate from whole cloth.\n- Cost: High; too many people present to invent major beats.\n- Plausibility: Strong; fits kids’ dynamics and existing rivalries.\n- Narrative economy: Explains the intensity of the afterward feuds neatly.\nTentative weight: High confidence that Mushroom’s color here tracks reality more than usual, even if the dialogue is embellished.\n\n3) Daemon and Nettles as lovers vs surrogate father/protégé\n- Cross-source: Conflicting; the relationship is intimate but ambiguous.\n- Incentive: High; turning it into an affair maximizes scandal.\n- Access: Mushroom is distant from the front; hearsay risk rises.\n- Cost: Moderate; wartime secrecy lets rumor flourish with fewer checks.\n- Plausibility: Both readings fit. Lover-reading aligns with Rhaenyra’s later order and Daemon’s letter; paternal-reading fits Nettles’ youth and Daemon’s pragmatism.\n- Narrative economy: Either version can explain Rhaenyra’s paranoia and Daemon’s choices; the “lover” version doesn’t uniquely solve a mystery the “protégé” version can’t.\nTentative weight: Ambiguous; I lean slightly toward “close but not necessarily lovers,” with Mushroom exaggerating the private into the prurient.\n\nQuestions for the sub:\n- What criteria am I missing? (E.g., linguistic markers of hearsay, known later corrections by archmaesters, or regional rumor pipelines.)\n- Which case flips under a stricter read?\n- If you had to pick one claim where Mushroom is most likely dead-right and one where he’s almost certainly spinning, what are they, and why?\n subreddit: asoiaf",

  "title: AIO fans spike to 100% during GPU‑only load — how do I make the curve follow coolant/GPU temp instead?\n self_text: TL;DR: During GPU‑heavy, CPU‑light workloads (RDR2, UE5 editor), my radiator fans randomly blast to 100% for a few seconds even though CPU isn’t hot. I think my curve is tied to “CPU” spikes. I’d like the rad fans to follow liquid or GPU temp with proper hysteresis. What’s the cleanest way to set this up (BIOS vs FanControl vs iCUE), and should my pump be locked at 100%?\n\nSpecs/Setup\n- CPU: Ryzen 5 5600X (PBO on)\n- Cooler: Corsair H100i 240mm (top exhaust)\n- GPU: RX 6800 XT\n- Mobo: MSI B550 Tomahawk (latest BIOS)\n- Case: Lian Li Lancool 215 (2x 200mm front intake, 1x rear 120mm exhaust; 2x 120mm on the rad)\n- Pump on AIO_PUMP; rad fans on CPU_FAN\n\nSymptoms/Observations\n- In GPU‑bound games and in UE5 viewport, radiator fans jump to 100% for 2–3 seconds intermittently.\n- HWiNFO: CPU Tctl/Tdie hovers ~55–60C with brief spikes to ~75–80C; GPU ~70–78C; coolant (when visible in iCUE) ~33–38C and steady.\n- Looks like the CPU sensor spikes are tripping the CPU_FAN curve even though coolant and sustained CPU temps are fine.\n\nWhat I’ve tried\n- BIOS Q‑Fan: smoothed the CPU_FAN curve and added step‑up/step‑down times; still get bursts (CPU Tctl spikes are fast).\n- iCUE: I can see “H100i Temp” but my mobo headers can’t target that directly from BIOS.\n- Moving fan header: If I move rad fans to SYS_FAN, BIOS still can’t reference GPU or coolant, and MSI’s “source” options are limited.\n\nWhat I want\n- Radiator fans to follow either coolant temp or GPU temp with a slow, smooth curve (hysteresis), so brief CPU spikes don’t cause jet mode.\n- Case fans that can ramp a bit with GPU temp.\n- Pump strategy: lock 100% vs gentle curve based on coolant?\n\nQuestions\n1) Best practice: Is it fine to leave the pump at 100% on AIO_PUMP and only curve the radiator fans? Any downside to a mild pump curve based on coolant (e.g., 60–80%)?\n2) FanControl route: Can someone share a step‑by‑step?\n   - Install FanControl, enable HWiNFO shared memory, select “GPU Diode” and/or “Corsair H100i Temp” as sensors.\n   - Create a curve for radiator fans based on coolant temp (or Max(GPU, CPU Tctl)) with 2–3s ramp‑up and 8–12s ramp‑down. Reasonable target breakpoints?\n   - Map front/rear case fans to GPU temp with a gentle curve to avoid whooshing.\n3) iCUE route (if keeping Corsair USB plugged in): Is it better to let iCUE directly control radiator fans off “Liquid Temp” and leave case fans to FanControl/BIOS?\n4) BIOS‑only fallback: If I must use BIOS, which sensor is least spiky on MSI? “CPU Socket” or “Motherboard” instead of Tctl? Recommended step‑up/down times?\n5) Mounting/airflow: With a top‑exhaust 240mm, is it normal for GPU heat to warm the rad and cause higher fan speeds during long GPU loads? Would moving the rad to front intake reduce spikes (while possibly raising GPU temps), or should I just tame the curve instead?\n6) Bonus: Any MSI Tomahawk quirks I should toggle (e.g., DC vs PWM mode, Smart Fan settings, hysteresis values) to reduce spikes?\n\nGoal settings I’m considering\n- Pump: fixed 100% (or 70–100% based on coolant 30–45C).\n- Rad fans: 30% until 33C coolant, 50% at 38C, 70% at 42C, 100% only above 46C; ramp‑up 3s, ramp‑down 12s.\n- Case fans: curve off GPU diode; 30% idle, 50% at 60C, 70% at 75C, 100% at 85C.\n\nIf you’ve solved this exact “GPU load but CPU spikes trigger the AIO” behavior, I’d love your wiring and software stack details.

  "title: 7800X3D temp spikes causing AIO/fans to rev at idle—best practices to calm it down?\n self_text: Build basics:\n- 7800X3D\n- B650 board\n- 240mm AIO (pump on AIO_PUMP header)\n- 32 GB DDR5-6000 EXPO\n- Mesh case with 2x front in, 1x rear out\n\nIssue: At desktop, tiny loads (opening a tab, starting a download) cause CPU temp to jump from mid-40s to 65–75C for a second, then drop. With radiator fans tied to CPU temp, I get constant “whoosh-rev-whoosh.” It’s not loud, just frequent enough to be annoying.\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n- Pump fixed at 100% and at ~70%: didn’t affect the ramping behavior (expected).\n- Fan curve based on CPU temp with generous slope and minimum 30% duty: still chases spikes.\n- Added step-up/step-down/hysteresis (10–12s): helps but occasional revs remain.\n- Windows: AMD Ryzen Balanced plan, min processor state 5%.\n- PBO: CO negative all-core -15 stable (OCCT small/AVX), PPT/TDC/EDC left stock. Eco Mode 65W didn’t change spikes much (as expected on X3D).\n\nQuestions for the hive mind:\n1) Best sensor to key radiator fans to on AM5? If I don’t have a coolant temp readout, is “CPU Socket” or “Motherboard” a better proxy than “CPU (Tctl/Tdie)” for smoothing the spikes?\n2) Ideal step-up/step-down times for AIO radiator fans in BIOS (ASUS/MSI/Gigabyte users)? I’m currently at ~10s up, ~15s down. Go longer?\n3) Any downside to letting rad fans idle at a higher floor (e.g., 800–900 RPM) to prevent frequent jumps from near-zero?\n4) PBO/CO tuning: Any go-to per-core negative CO targets you’ve found that reduce spike magnitude without risking stability on 7800X3D? Or better to cap EDC slightly?\n5) Any AM5-specific BIOS toggles (e.g., Typical Current Idle, CPPC) that actually reduce the micro-spikes without hurting responsiveness?\n6) Is leaving the pump at 100% truly the “set-and-forget” best practice for longevity on modern AIOs, or is a fixed ~70–80% wiser?\n\nGoal isn’t lower absolute temps (I know spikes are normal and safe), just quieter behavior at the desktop.
