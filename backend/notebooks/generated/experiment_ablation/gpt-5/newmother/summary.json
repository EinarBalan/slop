  "title: AITA for uninviting my in‑laws from Christmas after they refused our “no kissing the newborn” rule?\n self_text: I (32F) and my husband (34M) just had our first baby 6 weeks ago. We were planning to host his parents and siblings for 4–5 days over Christmas since they live 4 hours away and haven’t met the baby yet.\n\nBecause it’s peak RSV/flu season and our baby is still so young, we set some simple boundaries we shared with everyone a couple weeks ago: wash hands when you arrive, please don’t visit if you’re sick (even “just a little sniffly”), and no kissing the baby’s face/hands for now. We also asked that anyone who wants prolonged holding be up to date on Tdap/flu if possible. These are the same guidelines our pediatrician gave us.\n\nMy MIL immediately pushed back. She said we’re being “paranoid first-time parents,” that “we all kissed babies back in the day and they were fine,” and that as a grandmother she “has the right to kiss her grandbaby.” She also said her niece (3) has “a lingering cough” but it’s “definitely allergies” and they still planned to bring her.\n\nI tried to compromise: shorter daytime visit instead of overnights, we’d host meals so they don’t feel like they’re missing the holiday, and we could do lots of photos/FaceTime and plan a longer stay later this winter once baby is older and flu/RSV wave dies down. MIL doubled down and said I was “controlling” and “using rules to keep family away.” SIL chimed in that I’m “weaponizing the baby.”\n\nAt that point I told them we’re not comfortable hosting overnight if the rules won’t be respected and if anyone is actively coughing. We uninvited them for Christmas and invited them to come for a day visit in January/February if they can agree to the boundaries, or we can travel to them in spring when our pediatrician says it’s less risky.\n\nNow there’s a family group chat blow-up calling me the Grinch and saying I’m depriving them of “first Christmas memories.” My husband is on my side and told them it’s our call, but he hates conflict and asked if we should cave for “peace.” I genuinely don’t want to keep anyone away; I just don’t want a preventable illness for our newborn.\n\nAITA for drawing a hard line and uninviting them after they refused the no-kissing/handwashing/no-sick-visits rules?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: 6-week-old only naps on me—how do I gently start bassinet naps without hours of crying?\n self_text: Hi all—looking for gentle, actionable tips.\n\nBaby basics:\n- 6 weeks, gaining well, combo-fed (mostly breast, 1–2 bottles), lots of wet diapers. No reflux dx, some spit-up.\n- Nights: 2–3 hr stretches in bassinet with swaddle + white noise.\n- Days: will only nap on me. If I transfer, we get a 10–20 min nap max. Drowsy-but-awake = immediate protest that escalates.\n\nWhat I’m doing now:\n- Dark room, loud constant white noise, snug swaddle (arms in), pacifier as needed.\n- Trying transfers after 15–20 min of contact sleep but she pops awake on the put-down.\n- Wake windows around 60–70 min, but I may be missing sleepy cues.\n\nQuestions:\n1) Are 60–75 min wake windows about right at 6 weeks? Best cues for overtired vs undertired at this age?\n2) Daytime structure: okay to cap naps at 2 hours and wake to feed every ~3 hours to protect nights?\n3) Strategy: aim for just ONE bassinet nap a day to “practice” and keep the rest as contact to protect overall sleep, or go all-in and expect a rough few days?\n4) Gentle methods that actually work at this age: pick-up/put-down, shush–pat, gradual retreat? Would love step-by-step if you’ve got it.\n5) Transfer tips: warm the sheet, bum-down-first, keep hands on chest/hips for 2–3 min, sit next to bassinet for the first 10 min—what’s your winning sequence? Do you wait for deep sleep (12–20 min) or transfer earlier?\n6) When should I consider reflux/CMPI or other issues that make bassinet naps a losing battle (arching, chronic congestion, sandpapery cough, painful cries, back sleep refusal)?\n\nNotes:\n- Following safe sleep (flat, empty bassinet, back sleeping, no weighted wearables).\n- Not interested in CIO at this age—just looking for gentle scaffolding so by ~8–10 weeks we can get at least one bassinet nap and a bit more night consolidation.\n\nIf you have sample day rhythms (e.g., feed/wake/nap blocks) that worked for your 6–8 weekers, I’d appreciate seeing them.

  "title: AITA for refusing to let my family pass our 6‑week‑old around on Christmas and leaving early?\n self_text: I (31F) and my husband (33M) have a 6‑week‑old, our first baby and the first grandchild on his side. With RSV/flu/COVID going around and baby still so little, we told everyone ahead of time: please don’t visit if you’re sick, wash hands, no kissing, and we’ll likely keep her in the wrap so she can sleep. We also said we’d rather not have her passed around like a party favor; if anyone got a quick cuddle, it would be seated, one at a time, and only if she was awake and calm. My MIL said we were being “paranoid” and that “we all survived the 90s,” but we figured setting expectations early was better than drama on the day. Christmas at MIL’s had about 14 people. As soon as we arrived, SIL went to lift the baby out of the carrier while she was sleeping. I said, “Please don’t, she just fell asleep.” SIL rolled her eyes and said, “She needs to get used to her family.” Within 10 minutes, three different relatives asked to “just hold her for a sec,” and MIL announced, “It’s Grandma’s turn,” reaching for her. I said we were keeping her in the wrap until her next feed and then we could reassess. MIL got teary and said I was “ruining Christmas” and “punishing” her. FIL chimed in that I’m “weaponizing breastfeeding” because I said I’d nurse in another room to settle the baby. It got tense. After the third round of pressure and a comment about “building her immune system,” my husband said, “We’re going to head out—this isn’t respecting our boundary.” We left after about 40 minutes. Now the group chat is blowing up that we’re controlling, didn’t let anyone bond, and made them “walk on eggshells.” My husband supported leaving, but later asked if we could have compromised with a quick, seated hold for MIL. I feel like we communicated clearly, and it’s our job to prioritize baby’s health and sleep. AITA for sticking to our boundary and leaving when it wasn’t respected?\n subreddit: r/AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for setting a “no passing the baby” rule at Christmas and taking my 3‑month‑old back when relatives kept trying to wake him?\n self_text: Me (32F) and my husband (34M) have a 3-month-old son. He’s healthy but gets overstimulated easily, contact naps a lot, and has reflux. Our pediatrician suggested we limit how many people handle him during RSV/flu season and prioritize his sleep.\n\nA week before Christmas at my MIL’s (about 18 relatives), we sent a polite message with our ground rules: wash/sanitize hands before touching, no kissing, please don’t wake him, and we would not be “passing him around.” We said if he was calm and awake, we’d offer short, seated one-on-one holds. Everyone replied “of course!”\n\nDay-of, MIL kept saying “let everyone get a turn first,” and my aunt tried to lift him out of his bassinet while he was asleep. I said, “Please don’t wake him,” picked him up, and put him in a wrap. BIL joked “first-time mom vibes,” there were eye rolls, and a cousin pushed for a big group photo “with the baby in front,” insisting we wake him. We said we’d do photos when he woke. About 40 minutes later he woke hungry and gassy; we fed, burped, and did a quick photo with us holding him. People were visibly annoyed. MIL later told me I was “gatekeeping the baby” and “ruining the fun.” I said our priority is his sleep and health.\n\nNow the family group chat is blowing up—accusing me of being controlling and saying “in our family babies get passed; it’s how we bond.” My husband backs me, but asked if maybe a strict “no pass” rule was too much and we should’ve allowed brief holds. For context, every time he gets handled by multiple people he becomes overtired for hours and screams; we’re barely sleeping as it is. We also told anyone with sniffles (a couple claimed “just allergies”) to please keep distance.\n\nI don’t want to be a joy-stealer. I offered alternatives—talk to him while I hold him, take pics next to us, wait until he’s awake—but I drew the line at waking him and multiple passes. AITA for setting and enforcing a no-passing rule at Christmas?\n\nOpen to verdicts and also concrete scripts for next time. If consensus is NAH and we should set structured holding windows (e.g., two short holds with seated adults after a feed), I’ll consider it, but I need a way that won’t wreck his sleep or end in drama.\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: Twin parents: Wake to sync naps or let them sleep? 7‑week‑olds, overtired spiral by 6 pm\n self_text: We’ve got 7‑week‑old fraternal twins and I’m stuck on whether to wake one to keep them in sync or let the better sleeper keep sleeping.\n\nContext:\n- Feeding: combo breast + bottle, every ~2.5–3 hours in the day; on‑demand at night. Gaining well.\n- Sleep setup: dark room, white noise, swaddled, separate safe sleep spaces. Not trying to “sleep train,” just trying to avoid overtired chaos.\n- Wake windows we’re targeting: ~45–60 minutes.\n\nThe pattern:\n- Twin A does short naps (30–45 min) and by late afternoon is a wreck.\n- Twin B will happily nap 2–3 hours if we let him and seems fine… until bedtime, when everything unravels because A is overtired and B isn’t tired enough. We get false starts for A and party mode for B around 8–10 pm, then everyone’s fried.\n\nWhat we’ve tried:\n- Capping B’s naps sometimes at 2 hours, but we’re inconsistent because I hate waking a sleeping baby.\n- Occasionally waking B to feed when A wakes so feeds line up, but then I worry I’m short‑changing his sleep.\n- Contact napping for A to extend one nap; it helps, but I can’t do that all day with two.\n- Earlier bedtime for A = more false starts.\n\nQuestions for twin parents (or anyone who’s been here):\n- Did you wake the sleeping twin during the day to keep naps/feeds synced? If so, what cap worked (90 min? 2 hours?) without wrecking night sleep?\n- Is “wake to feed both” during the day the lesser of two evils at this age to prevent one kid spiraling into overtiredness?\n- Any rules of thumb for total daytime sleep per twin at 6–10 weeks that helped you avoid the 6 pm meltdown zone?\n- If one twin is a chronic catnapper, did you build in one protected longer nap (e.g., contact or stroller) just for that twin to break the cycle?\n- Sample schedules welcome—especially how you handled the late afternoon stretch and bedtime so they both land in roughly the same window.\n\nI know every baby is different; I’m just looking for practical frameworks from folks who’ve done twins at this stage.

  "title: Holiday visit with 3‑week‑old twins: how to enforce “no kissing/hand washing” without causing a family meltdown?\n self_text: We’re bringing our 3‑week‑old twins to a small family holiday get‑together (8 adults, 2 kids). We’ve set basic boundaries: please wash/sanitize hands before holding; no kissing faces/hands; don’t come if you’re sick/recently sick; we may say no to holding if babies are sleeping/overstimulated; we’ll babywear most of the time; we’ll stay ~90 minutes to protect feeds/bedtime. Most folks said “of course,” but MIL and my sister are pushing back: “You’re being paranoid, babies need germs,” “Tradition is passing the baby around,” and one joked they’d “sneak a kiss” because “grandma’s rights.” I’m trying to keep the peace while keeping the babies safe (RSV/flu season) and preventing overtired chaos. I plan to send a friendly group text a few days before as a reminder, but I’m nervous about tone and consequences if someone pushes it in the moment. Looking for: 1) Script ideas for the reminder text that are warm but firm. 2) In‑person phrases for redirecting (“We’re doing no kisses for now—thanks for helping us keep them healthy!”). 3) Practical enforcement tips: babywearing etiquette, offering alternatives (feet tickles, photos, air high‑fives), how to handle the “but I washed my hands earlier” line. 4) Consequences that aren’t nuclear—e.g., if someone kisses anyway, do we take a break and leave, or is there a middle step? 5) Any pitfalls I’m missing (timing the visit around naps/feeds, setting an arrival/departure window). Would love tried‑and‑true approaches that keep boundaries intact without turning the day into a standoff.\n subreddit: Parenting",
  "title: Holiday visit with 6‑week‑old twins: how do we enforce “no passing the babies” without blowing up the family?\n self_text: We’ve got 6‑week‑old twins (one has reflux, both get overstimulated fast). We’re driving to a big family holiday gathering where everyone traditionally takes turns holding any new baby. We’d like to do the visit, but we don’t want the babies being passed around. It’s RSV/flu season, their sleep is fragile, and frankly they melt down when handled a lot.\n\nOur plan/comfort level:\n- Keep them mostly in carriers with us.\n- No kissing/face touching, handwashing first, no one who’s sick/recently sick.\n- Short window (about 90 minutes), we leave at first overtired cues.\n- Maybe seated brief holds for grandparents only if babies are calm and we offer.\n\nThe issue: MIL says I’m being “rude/paranoid” and that “babies need to be passed around to get used to germs.” My spouse is on my side but is conflict‑avoidant and keeps saying “let’s play it by ear,” which usually results in boundary pushing in the moment.\n\nQuestions for r/Parenting:\n1) Are these boundaries reasonable for newborn twins?\n2) Script help for a group text ahead of time and in‑person one‑liners. I’m thinking:\n- “We’re excited to see everyone! To keep the twins healthy and sleeping, we’re keeping them in carriers and not passing them around this year. Please wash hands, no kissing, and if you’re under the weather we’ll catch you next time. Thanks for helping us stick to this.”\n- In the moment: “We’re keeping them in the carriers today,” “We’re not doing passes yet,” “Happy to let you peek and chat while they snooze.”\n3) Consequences: Is it reasonable to say “If the boundaries aren’t respected, we’ll head out—no hard feelings”? How do we do that gracefully?\n4) Vaccine etiquette: Is it okay to ask close family about Tdap/flu, or just stick to the no‑holding rule and let that cover it?\n5) Twin‑specific tips for managing a short holiday visit (two carriers? rotate? white noise? timing visits around a feed so they’ll sleep?).\n\nI’m trying to prioritize health and sleep without making a holiday scene.

  "title: AITA for asking holiday guests not to kiss our 6-week-old and to wash hands or we’d leave, then actually leaving when they didn’t?\n self_text: Me 31F, husband 33M, MIL 60F, FIL 62M, SIL 28F. We have a 6-week-old baby. Our pediatrician’s guidance was pretty straightforward: avoid crowded indoor gatherings, keep anyone sick away, wash hands before holding, and no kissing baby’s face/hands during peak RSV/flu.\n\nWe didn’t want to skip the holiday entirely, so we tried to set expectations. A week before, I texted the family group chat: we’ll visit for about an hour, please wash hands before holding, no kissing baby, and if anyone is sick or has been around sick people, no hard feelings—please sit this one out. We said we’d baby-wear part of the time and might step into a quiet room for feeding/diaper changes. Everybody “thumbs-upped” the message.\n\nWe arrived with food and gifts, and right away MIL reached for the baby. I asked her to please wash her hands first. She rolled her eyes but did it. Two minutes later, she kissed the baby’s cheek and said, “My house, my rules. I raised three kids; he’ll be fine.” I said, “We’re not saying you’re a bad mom—this is just our boundary for now.” She huffed and said we were being dramatic and “scared of germs.” SIL chimed in that social media has everyone paranoid and that “babies need exposure.”\n\nI took the baby back and said we’d hang out while baby-wearing, and folks could say hi without touching. MIL called me rude, took a swipe at my “Pinterest parenting,” and a few minutes later kissed her fingers and tapped the baby’s hand “for good luck.” At that point, my husband and I looked at each other and decided to go. We’d been there maybe 35 minutes of the planned hour. We said, “We’re heading out—this isn’t working for us today,” and left.\n\nCue the group chat: we “ruined Christmas,” “used the baby as leverage,” and “disrespected the matriarch in her own home.” Husband is backing me but feels torn; he hates conflict with his mom. For what it’s worth, we didn’t demand masks or tests, didn’t prevent anyone from seeing the baby, and brought dinner sides and gifts. We were just trying to follow basic hygiene and our doctor’s advice. I also would have applied the same boundary to my own parents.\n\nAITA for setting those rules and then leaving when they weren’t respected?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: Newborn twins + split nights: do you wake the sleeper to feed and how tight should wake windows be?\n self_text: We have 3-week-old di/di twins, both back above birth weight and cleared by the pediatrician to do up to 3–4 hour stretches at night if they want. Bottle-feeding expressed milk with a small top-off of formula as needed. Both in swaddles in separate bassinets, white noise, room ~68–70F, blackout curtains.\n\nWhat’s happening:\n- Evenings devolve into cluster feeding for Twin A while Twin B will zonk out… which desyncs them. Then we get a “split night” around 2–4 a.m. with one wide awake/grunty partygoer while the other finally wants to sleep.\n- Day naps are mostly 20–40 minutes unless we do contact naps (then we can get 60–90). Transitions from arms to bassinet are hit-or-miss.\n- We’re aiming for feeds every ~2.5–3 hours during the day, 3–4 hours overnight if they let us. Bedtime routine around 8:30, optional dream feed at ~10:30.\n\nQuestions for twin parents/sleep pros:\n1) Do you wake the sleeping twin to feed when the other wakes at night (i.e., “feed both” to keep them synced)? Did it actually reduce split nights, or did it create more overtiredness?\n2) Daytime nap caps: would you wake both twins at the 2-hour mark during the day to preserve night sleep and sync, or let one take a unicorn nap if it happens?\n3) Wake windows for 3–4 weeks: 45–60 minutes total from eyes open to eyes closed, including the feed, burp, and diaper? Any tips to avoid tipping into overtiredness when the bottle + burp already eats most of that time?\n4) If one twin is consistently more reflux-y and needs 20 minutes upright post-feed, how do you keep windows equivalent without wrecking the other twin’s schedule?\n5) Any sample 24-hour rhythm that worked for you (especially if you did bassinet naps vs. contact naps)? We’re ok with contact naps for sanity, but want to avoid teaching them that only arms = sleep.\n\nGoal: fewer 2–4 a.m. parties, more predictable night stretches, and a sustainable routine for both babies. Would love your real-world twin strategies and what you’d tweak at this age versus waiting a few more weeks.\n subreddit: Parenting",
  "title: Twin parents: Do you wake the sleeping twin to keep them on the same schedule? 5-week-olds, overtired/undertired cycle is killing us\n self_text: We have 5-week-old twins (born at 38w, both gaining well). Twin A will happily take a 3–4 hour nap in the afternoon, then wants to party from ~10pm–2am. Twin B catnaps all day, gets super fussy by evening, and is clearly overtired. They’ve drifted completely out of sync, and we’re stuck in an overtired/undertired loop.\n\nCurrent routine: feeding roughly every 2.5–3 hours during the day, on demand overnight. We try to keep wake windows ~45–60 minutes. We do swaddles, white noise, and a dark room at night; daytime naps are in brighter light. No CIO, just soothing, rocking, and shushing. Both will do contact naps; independent naps are hit or miss. One has mild reflux so we hold upright after feeds.\n\nWhat we’re unsure about:\n- During the day, do you wake the sleeping twin to feed when the other eats to keep them aligned, even if the sleeper would go another hour?\n- Should we cap any single daytime nap at 2 hours at this age to protect bedtime?\n- Overnight, if one does a longer stretch, do you wake the other to match it or let them diverge and resync in the morning?\n- Any tricks to avoid “split nights” for Twin A who takes that long late nap?\n- How do you keep them awake enough for a full feed so they don’t snack-and-doze?\n- Realistic wake windows for 5 weeks? Is 45–60 minutes right, or should we go shorter for Twin B?\n\nWe’re following safe sleep and have pediatrician clearance on weight gain, so we’re comfortable waking if that’s the consensus. Would love sample schedules or what actually worked for you to nudge two very different babies into a workable rhythm without CIO. Thanks!\n subreddit: Parenting",
  "title: 8-week-old twins: wake the sleeper to feed, or let them ride? Trying to prevent overtired meltdowns and keep them in sync\n self_text: Di/di twins, 8 weeks. Combo feeding (mostly formula, some pumped milk). Gaining well; pediatrician okayed 4–5 hour stretches at night if they want it.\n\nWhat’s tripping us up is keeping them aligned without creating over‑tiredness:\n- Twin A is a catnapper (30–40 min) and gets wired/cranky fast.\n- Twin B will happily do 75–90 min wake windows and take longer naps.\n- If I wake both for every daytime feed, A spirals into overtired meltdowns. If I let one sleep, they desync and evenings are chaos.\n\nCurrent approach:\n- Start day ~7:00 a.m.\n- Offering 2.5–3 oz every ~2.5–3 hours in the day.\n- Wake windows: aiming 60–75 min, watching sleepy cues.\n- White noise, dark room, swaddle, contact naps as needed.\n- Dr. Brown’s bottles, paced feeds, burping mid‑feed and at end.\n\nQuestions for twin parents:\n- Do you treat them as a unit and always wake the sleeper to feed, or keep them within a certain “window” (e.g., 15–30 min) and let one finish the nap?\n- Daytime max nap length and max time between feeds that worked for you at this age?\n- Realistic wake window range for 8 weeks for twins specifically?\n- Any gentle ways to move from contact naps to bassinet without full CIO? (Pick‑up/put‑down tips, transfer timing, etc.)\n- Dream feed for twins: helpful to reduce the witching hour/early split nights, or just causes more wakefulness?\n- If one twin seems a little reflux‑y (arching, frequent hiccups), did smaller/more frequent feeds help or just make naps shorter? How long upright after a feed worked for you?\n- Solo‑parenting logistics: do you tandem feed every time or stagger? Twin Z pillow tips welcome.\n- If you have a sample day (feed/nap) that kept your twins roughly in sync, I’d love to see it.\n\nGoal: avoid the 5–8 p.m. meltdown window and get both down within ~15–30 minutes of each other without ping‑ponging all night.\n\nI know all babies are different—just looking for frameworks that worked for your twins around this age.

  "title: AITA for taking our newborn back from my MIL after she kissed him at Christmas and leaving early?\n self_text: Me: 32F, Husband: 34M, Baby: 6 weeks.\n\nWe did Christmas at my in‑laws this weekend. Because it’s flu/RSV season and our baby is still tiny, we sent a group text a few days beforehand with very clear boundaries: please don’t come if you’re sick, wash/sanitize hands before holding, and no kissing the baby—faces, hands, head, anything. Everyone hearted the message, including MIL.\n\nWe arrive, things are fine for about 20 minutes. I hand the baby to MIL after she sanitizes. Within a minute she leans in and kisses his forehead and then his hands. I said, “Please don’t kiss him—we just sent that out and it’s really important to us.” She brushed it off with, “Oh, I’m his grandma, it’s fine,” and did it again, saying, “I raised three kids, don’t be dramatic.”\n\nI walked over, took the baby back and said we’re serious about this, and if it’s too hard to remember, we’ll do no holding for today. MIL got teary and said I embarrassed her in front of family. BIL chimed in that we’re “first‑time parent paranoid” and that babies “need germs.” I said we’re not debating this and asked my husband if we could just eat quickly and head out. When MIL made another comment about “my baby” and reached toward him again, we decided to leave before dinner.\n\nNow we’re getting texts that we ruined Christmas, that I “snatched” the baby, and that I owe MIL an apology for “accusing her of being dirty.” For the record, I never said she was dirty—I asked for a boundary everyone agreed to in writing, for a newborn during peak illness season. My own parents have followed it without issue.\n\nHusband is on my side but hates the fallout with his family. He wants to give it a couple days, then invite MIL over with the same rules, supervised.

Baby A is a super sleepy potato, Baby B is a spicy catnapper and gets overtired fast. I’m trying to figure out whether to wake the sleepy one to keep them on the same schedule or let him sleep and deal with them being off-cycle.\n\nDetails:\n- Bottle-fed expressed milk, ~3–3.5 oz per feed\n- Daytime: A would go 3–4 hours if I let him; B does 20–40 min naps and is cranky\n- Nights: “bedtime” ~9 pm, up every 2–3 hours but never together\n\nQuestions:\n1) During the day, would you wake the sleepy twin at 2–3 hours to feed with the other so they stay aligned, or let the sleeper go and hope the catnapper catches up?\n2) Reasonable wake windows at 5 weeks to avoid overtired? I’m aiming 45–60 min including feed/diaper.\n3) Would you cap daytime naps at ~2 hours to protect nights, or is that too early to matter?\n4) Any twin tricks that helped you “anchor” them—dream feed, cluster feed, stagger by 15 min, etc.?\n\nWhat we’re doing:\n- Swaddle, white noise, dark room for naps/nights\n- Daytime lights up/interaction; change/burp between sides of the bottle\n- Trying eat–play–sleep, but B often needs sleep immediately after eating\n\nThey’re gaining well per the last check; we’ll confirm overnight stretches with our ped.

  "title: Fish keeps sticking to my stainless and I scorch the fond before I can make a pan sauce—what should I change?\n self_text: I’m trying to nail a simple weeknight fish + pan sauce in a stainless skillet and keep striking out.\n\nGear/ingredients:\n- 12\" tri-ply stainless skillet (All-Clad style), gas stove\n- Neutral oil (canola/avocado), fish spatula, instant-read thermometer\n- Fish: mostly skin-on salmon or skinless cod/halibut portions, about 1” thick\n\nWhat I do:\n- Pat fish dry, salt right before cooking (no marinade).\n- Preheat pan ~2–3 minutes on medium-high. A drop of water skitters. Add 1–2 tbsp oil until shimmering.\n- Lay fish in (skin-side down for salmon), press gently for ~10 seconds to prevent curling.\n- Try not to move it; aim to flip when it “releases.” Target 120–125F for salmon, 130F for cod/halibut.\n- After sear, I want to pour off excess fat, add shallot/garlic, deglaze with white wine + a splash of stock, finish with lemon, capers, and a knob of butter.\n\nMy problems:\n- Fish often sticks and tears when I try to flip, even when I wait 3–4 minutes.\n- If it doesn’t stick, the fond goes from promising to scorched quickly, so my sauce tastes bitter.\n- Lowering heat seems to reduce sticking but I don’t get good browning or much fond.\n- Light dredge in flour helped with cod but felt heavy; I’d prefer a clean sear if possible.\n\nQuestions:\n- How hot should the pan really be for fish in stainless? Is the “mercury ball” water test too hot?\n- Is pre-salting 30–60 minutes (then patting dry) better for surface dryness and release?\n- How much oil should I be using—just a thin film or a shallow fry?\n- For delicate fish (cod/halibut), is stainless simply the wrong tool vs. nonstick/cast iron?\n- Best way to build a quick sauce without burning fond—do I need to pull the pan off heat before deglazing?\n- Any tips on using a splash of Better Than Bouillon as a fast stock base without overpowering the sauce?\n\nHoping for step-by-step heat cues and timing signs (visual/audio) to prevent sticking and rescue that fond.

  "title: AITA for telling my MIL we won’t attend her Christmas Eve if she insists on passing our 6‑week‑old around?\n self_text: Throwaway because family lurks. I (31F) and my husband (33M) had our first baby six weeks ago. He’s healthy but tiny, and our pediatrician strongly recommended we limit close contact during RSV/flu season, stick to hand washing, no kissing, and ideally baby-wear in crowds for the first couple months.\n\nMIL (59F) is hosting Christmas Eve—about 20–25 people in a medium townhouse, lots of kids. We told her we’d love to stop by for 60–90 minutes so we can see grandparents and drop off gifts, but we plan to baby-wear and not pass the baby around. Anyone who wants to peek can do so while we’re seated, clean hands, no kissing, and if anyone is sick they should skip holding entirely. We also offered a quiet one-on-one visit later in the week so she could get proper snuggle time without the crowd.\n\nShe got upset and said, “It’s a family holiday, everyone will want to meet him. In my house, family holds the baby.” She also said our “rules” are embarrassing and make her look like she doesn’t know how to be a grandmother. For context, last month at a smaller gathering she tried to take the baby out of my wrap without asking and kissed his head after I said no kissing. I corrected her and she said I was being dramatic.\n\nI told her calmly that our boundaries aren’t negotiable, and if the expectation is that he’ll be passed around, then we’ll skip the party this year and FaceTime. We can visit her separately in a quiet setting. She accused me of “keeping her grandson from the family,” said I’m controlling, and texted the group chat that we’re “cancelling Christmas.” SIL says we’re “stealing his first Christmas memory” from the cousins. My husband is 100% on the same page as me and told his mom that if she can’t respect our rules, we aren’t coming. Now MIL is saying we’re punishing her for hosting.\n\nI get that people are excited. I also understand that babies are resilient. But he’s six weeks old, it’s peak sick season, and I don’t think it’s wild to keep him in the wrap and do hand hygiene/no kissing. I feel like we offered a reasonable compromise.\n\nAITA for saying we won’t attend if she insists on passing our newborn around?\n\nHappy to take judgment (NTA/YTA/NAH/ESH).

  "title: Wake the baby to save bedtime? 12-week-old twins, last nap chaos\n self_text: We’ve got 12-week-old twins and the last nap keeps torpedoing bedtime. Looking for practical, experience-based advice on whether to wake/cap naps to protect bedtime, and how you handled it with two babies on slightly different rhythms.\n\nWhat’s happening:\n- Target wake: 7:00–7:30 am. Bedtime goal: 7:30–8:00 pm.\n- Wake windows: ~60–90 min, depending on sleep pressure.\n- Twin A takes short naps (30–45 min). Twin B can do 90–120 min if we let him.\n- If Twin B’s last nap starts around 5:30 and runs long, bedtime becomes 9:00+ with overtired meltdowns.\n- Room is dark, loud white noise, swaddles, consistent wind-down. We do eat–play–sleep.\n\nQuestions:\n- Would you cap any single nap at 2 hours at this age? If so, how do you wake gently without causing full-on crankiness?\n- Do you cap the last nap at 30–45 min and/or set a hard “wake by” time (e.g., 5:30–6:00 pm) to protect bedtime?\n- On days of crummy naps, how early is “too early” for bedtime? Is a 6:00–6:30 pm bedtime reasonable for 12-week-olds?\n- For twins specifically: did you wake the better sleeper to keep them roughly aligned, or let them drift and just stagger bedtime routines?\n- If you cap a nap, do you offer a small feed upon wake to reset the cycle, or wait for normal hunger cues so you don’t feed too frequently?\n\nAny sample schedules from twin parents around 10–14 weeks would be amazing, plus tips for capping without creating two overtired babies. Also open to “bridge” strategies (e.g., a brief contact nap or stroller loop) to get to bedtime without wrecking the night. Thanks!\n subreddit: Parenting",
  "title: Do I wake my 10‑week‑old from the last nap to protect bedtime, or risk an overtired meltdown?\n self_text: Looking for sanity checks from folks who’ve been here. My 10‑week‑old is generally a happy baby, but our evenings are a mess and I can’t tell if I should be capping the last nap or letting it ride.\n\nDetails:\n- Daytime naps are mostly 30–45 mins in the bassinet, but the last nap often turns into a long contact nap (up to 2 hours) if I let it.\n- Wake windows are ~60–75 mins. I watch sleepy cues but they escalate fast in the late afternoon.\n- We feed roughly every 2.5–3 hours in the day, aim for a bedtime around 7:30–8:00, white noise + swaddle + paci, E.A.S.Y-ish flow.\n\nWhat’s happening:\n- If I cap the last nap to keep bedtime on track, baby wakes cranky and we get a full-on overtired meltdown by bedtime, then a rough first stretch of the night.\n- If I let the last nap run, bedtime pushes way later (sometimes 9:00+), which seems to cause split nights or more frequent wakes.\n- Early bedtime helps sometimes, but not if the last wake window ends up being super short (then bedtime is a party).\n\nQuestions:\n1) For this age, would you cap the last nap to 30–45 mins and go for an early bedtime, even if they seem grumpy on wake?\n2) Is a 10–15 minute “bridge nap” (stroller/hold) late in the day a good idea, or does that just sabotage bedtime?\n3) Do you cap any single nap at 2 hours in the day to protect calories/bedtime, or let baby sleep as long as they want once down?\n4) Any favorite evening routines for this age that reduce the witching hour (bath before last nap, top-off feed, earlier PJs, etc.)?\n\nI’m trying to avoid a cycle where we either blow bedtime or end up with an overtired mess. Would love sample rhythms that worked for your babies around 10–12 weeks and how you handled that tricky last nap. Thanks!\n subreddit: Parenting",
  "title: Twins (7 weeks): Wake the good sleeper to keep them in sync, or let him go? How to avoid the 5–8 pm overtired spiral?\n self_text: Twins are 7 weeks (born 37+3). Baby A: 8 lb 12 oz, catnaps 20–40 min and melts down by evening. Baby B: 9 lb 6 oz, naps 1.5–2 hrs and does a 4–5 hr stretch at night.\n\nContext:\n- Feeding: combo (mostly bottle of pumped + some formula), 90–120 ml every ~2.5–3 hrs in daytime. Overnight is on demand.\n- Sleep setup: dark room, white noise, Love To Dream swaddles, bassinets, room ~20°C.\n- Wake windows: aiming for 60–75 min. Bedtime routine around 7:30 pm, dream feed at ~10:30.\n\nQuestions:\n1) Daytime: should I cap B’s naps at 2 hrs and wake/feed both every ~3 hrs to keep them aligned, or let B sleep and run A on demand (even if they’re out of sync all day)?\n2) Night: if B does a 4–5 hr stretch, should I wake A for a dream feed to preserve that stretch and get everyone back down, or let A’s 2–3 hr wakes happen and keep B asleep?\n3) Are 60–75 min wake windows right for 7 weeks, or should I keep A closer to 45–60 to avoid the overtired spiral?\n4) Twin-friendly ways to extend A’s naps without full contact every time (crib hour, contact for first 20 min then transfer, babywear one while managing the other, pick-up/put-down)?\n5) 5–8 pm witching hour: any sample schedules that work with a 3:30 preschool pickup and solo-parenting 4–6 pm? Car nap vs. stroller walk? Split feeds?\n6) Pacifiers to bridge the 30–45 min nap transition—is that helpful now or a future sleep crutch?\n7) We have a Twin Z pillow and a wrap.

  "title: Twin 8-week-olds stuck in the overtired-at-bedtime loop — how do you cap naps, sync feeds, and set wake windows?\n self_text: We’ve got di/di twins, 8 weeks old, formula-fed. Both gaining well and generally happy… until evening, when we hit the overtired wall and bedtime explodes.\n\nWhat we’re doing now:\n- Wake-up: ~7:00 a.m.\n- Feeds: every 3 hours during the day (3–4 oz), responsive at night\n- Wake windows: ~60–75 min earlier in the day, ~75–90 min later\n- Naps: mostly 30–45 minutes; occasionally one twin will do a 1.5–2 hour stretch if held\n- Sleep setup: bassinet, swaddle, dark room, white noise, room around 70–72°F, pacifier if needed\n- Bedtime attempt: 7:30–8:30 p.m., but evenings are fussy and they fight the last nap hard\n\nComplications:\n- One twin loves contact naps and will only do 20–30 minutes in the bassinet; the other will do decent crib naps but then evenings go off the rails if the day naps run long.\n- If I let a long nap happen late afternoon, bedtime is a mess. If I cap it, we risk a cranky, overtired stretch.\n- Nights vary: sometimes one does a 5–6 hour stretch while the other wants to feed at 3–4 hours. I’m unsure about waking the sleeper to keep them “in sync.”\n\nQuestions for seasoned twin parents (or anyone who’s survived this phase):\n1) Do you cap individual naps at 90 min–2 hours at this age, and do you cap total day sleep to protect bedtime?\n2) How tightly do you stick to wake windows for 8-week-olds vs just following tired cues?\n3) Is it worth trying a dream feed to smooth the evening and avoid the 9–11 p.m. chaos?\n4) Best way to keep twins synced: wake both for daytime feeds, or let one sleep and hope they converge?\n5) Tips for transitioning the contact-napper to bassinet naps without full-on CIO (I know true sleep training is later)?\n6) If last nap is a bust, do you move bedtime super early (like 6:30) or push them gently to a “normal” time?\n\nI’m not looking for perfection—just a predictable-ish rhythm and fewer overtired meltdowns.

  "title: Twin newborns: Do you wake the sleeper to keep them on the same schedule? One baby keeps getting overtired.\n self_text: Twin parents, I need your playbook. We’ve got 5-week-old fraternal twins, full-term, gaining well. We’re combo-feeding (pumped milk + formula). Daytime goal is feeds about every 3 hours; nights are more on-demand since our pediatrician okayed longer stretches now that they’re back above birth weight.\n\nThe problem: if I “wake the other twin” to feed together, Baby A ends up overtired and fights the next nap (and then our nights are rough). If I let Baby A sleep, the schedules drift and I’m basically feeding someone every hour and a half and can’t get anything else done. Baby B is a catnapper and gets cranky faster; Baby A is a deep sleeper but pays for it later if I wake them.\n\nWhat we’re doing:\n- Eat-wake-sleep pattern with wake windows around 45–60 minutes.\n- Swaddle, dark room, white noise.\n- Most naps in bassinets when we can; some contact naps to save our sanity.\n- Night sleep in separate bassinets in our room, following safe sleep.\n\nWhat I’m unsure about:\n- Did you always wake the other twin for daytime feeds? If so, when did you stop?\n- If you don’t fully wake both, do you stagger feeds by 15–20 minutes to keep them roughly aligned?\n- Do you ever cap a long nap to prevent total schedule drift? If yes, how long is “too long” for a daytime nap at this age?\n- Any tricks to prevent that overtired spiral when waking the better sleeper (e.g., top-off feeds, shorter wake window after a forced wake)?\n- How did you handle cluster feeding with two so it didn’t wreck the overnight?\n- If you have sample daytime rhythms that worked (even loosely), I’d love to see them.\n\nI’m solo with them most of the day and trying to find that sweet spot between “protect sleep” and “protect the schedule.” I’m not looking for one right answer—just what actually worked for your twins in the first two months.

  "title: AITA for asking family not to pass my 6‑week‑old around at Christmas and setting “holding windows” instead?\n self_text: Me 33F, husband 34M, first baby 6 weeks old. We’re supposed to do Christmas at my MIL’s with about 18 people. Our pediatrician recommended limiting how many people handle the baby (RSV/flu season), no kissing, hand‑washing, and keeping wake windows short because our kiddo gets overstimulated and then we get a rough night. So I sent a group text saying: we’re excited to see everyone, but please wash hands before holding, no kissing, and if you’re sick or just getting over something please sit this one out. I also said we won’t be passing the baby around all day—there will be two short “holding windows” when baby is awake/happy (basically after a feed), otherwise baby will be with me, my husband, or in a bassinet/carrier so we can protect sleep. MIL and SIL flipped, saying I’m controlling and “treating family like strangers,” and that “babies need to be passed around to bond.” BIL said if they can’t hold the baby as long as they want they might not bother coming. Husband is 100% on my side. To compromise, I suggested we just stop by for 60–90 minutes between nap/feeds, stick to the hygiene rules, and anyone who really wants a longer snuggle can schedule a short one‑on‑one visit another day. MIL says I’m ruining Christmas and has been vague‑booking about “selfish new moms.” I feel like I’m just following medical advice and managing an overtired newborn, but I admit the “holding windows” probably sounded rigid.

My son is 8 weeks (born 39w, healthy, gaining well). We’re stuck in what feels like an overtired loop and I can’t tell if I should be capping naps, waking to feed, or just letting him catch up.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- Day-night is established (first stretch at night is 3–3.5 hrs, then 2–3 hrs).\n- Day naps are inconsistent: some 25–40 min catnaps unless he’s on me, then he’ll do 1.5–2.5 hrs.\n- Wake windows: aiming 60–75 min, watching sleepy cues (yawns, glazed stare, red brows). If we miss the window by even 10 minutes, he’s fussy and hard to settle.\n- Bedtime routine around 7:30/8:00, but we’re getting a witching-hour meltdown and not really “down” until 9:30–10:00.\n- Feeding: mostly breastfed on demand with 1 bottle in the evening. He’ll cluster feed late afternoon/early evening.\n- Environment: dark room, white noise, swaddle, cool temp, safe sleep in bassinet. He’ll nap independently sometimes, but most “good” naps are contact naps.\n\nMy questions:\n1) If he finally takes a long nap (say 2.5 hrs) after a rough morning, do I wake him at 2 hrs to protect bedtime/schedule, or let him sleep to pay off the debt?\n2) Is waking to feed during the day (e.g., every 2.5–3 hrs) worth it at this age to keep nights from going off the rails, or is that just disrupting needed recovery sleep?\n3) On short-nap days, should I push for an earlier bedtime (like 6:30/7:00) or keep the usual time and add a late catnap?\n4) Is it reasonable to plan 1–2 days of “rescue” contact naps to reset overtiredness, or does that just make independent sleep harder later?\n5) Sample schedules welcome! What wake-window lengths worked for your 8-week-olds? Did you adjust per nap (shorter windows after a short nap)?\n6) Any practical tricks to lengthen naps without formal “training” at this age? (We do a 5–10 min crib hour attempt, shush/rock mid-nap, and try a pacifier re-plug.)\n\nI’m not trying to sleep train a newborn—just want to break the overtired cycle and protect night sleep where we can.

  "title: Fish keeps sticking to stainless even with “hot pan, cold oil”—what am I missing?\n self_text: I’m trying to get confident searing fish on stainless and keep tearing it up. Nonstick works, but I’d like to master stainless for better browning and pan sauces.\n\nSetup:\n- Pan: 12\" All-Clad D3 stainless\n- Oil: canola or avocado\n- Fish: skinless cod loins and skin-on salmon fillets, ~1\" thick\n- Tools: thin fish spatula, paper towels, IR thermometer\n\nWhat I’m doing:\n- Pat fish dry thoroughly. Lightly salt right before cooking (sometimes 10–15 min ahead).\n- Preheat pan dry 3–4 min on medium-high until the water-drop test beads/skitters.\n- IR reads ~400–425°F pan surface pre-oil. Add 1–2 tbsp oil; it shimmers (pan drops to ~360–380°F).\n- Lay fish in, press gently 5–10 seconds for contact, then hands off for 2–4 min.\n- I wait for “release,” but when I try to flip, it still sticks and tears. If I go longer, the edges overbrown.\n- Tried slightly lower heat (pan ~320–340°F after oil) and slightly higher heat (~390°F after oil). Tried a bit more oil. Similar sticking.\n\nQuestions:\n- Ideal surface temp targets for stainless with cod/salmon? Is my pan too hot/cool after adding oil?\n- Does salting 10–15 min ahead create surface moisture that promotes sticking? Better to salt after the flip?\n- Should I let the fish take the fridge chill off first (15–20 min), or does that risk mush?\n- Are there visual cues beyond “it releases when ready”? For example: color creeps 1/4 way up the side, faint sizzle volume drop, edges turning opaque, etc.?\n- Any benefit to a super-light flour/starch dusting, or does that just mask technique?\n- Should I add a small pat of butter after the initial sear to help release, or will milk solids make sticking worse?\n- Is there any merit to “seasoning” stainless (polymerized oil layer), or is that snake oil for this use case?\n\nBonus: simple weeknight pan sauce ideas that are gentle on a sensitive gut (Crohn’s). I’m thinking:\n- Quick deglaze with low-sodium chicken stock or dry vermouth (small splash), reduce, finish with ghee or lactose-free butter, dill/chives.\n- Lemon zest instead of juice for brightness without too much acid.\n- For salmon: deglaze with a little stock + white miso whisked in off-heat, then dilute as needed.\n\nWould love any temperature/time guardrails and release cues you rely on, plus sauce tweaks that won’t wreck a sensitive stomach.

  "title: AITA for asking family to wash hands and not kiss our newborn during holiday gatherings?\n self_text: Our son is 3 weeks old. We planned to do brief stops at two family holiday gatherings so grandparents/aunts/uncles could meet him, but we set clear rules ahead of time: quick visits, baby stays in the wrap with me, please wash hands before touching, no kissing, and if you’re sick (or just getting over something), please sit this one out.\n\nI sent the rules a week in advance in a group text. Most people said “totally understand.” My MIL called my husband and said we were “being dramatic” because “we all survived without this germ stuff,” and that she “waited long enough to be a grandma again” so she’d be “taking her turn.”\n\nAt stop #1 (his sister’s house, ~20 people), there were two visibly snotty/coughy little cousins. SIL said they just had “lingering colds.” I wore the baby and greeted everyone. I had hand sanitizer by the door and asked people to use it if they wanted to touch his foot/blanket. Most were respectful, but MIL kept pushing to “take him out of the contraption.” I said I’m keeping him in the wrap because he sleeps better there and it limits passes. She rolled her eyes and said I’m making him “too attached.”\n\nAbout 30 minutes in, I turned to grab water and saw an aunt lean in and kiss his head. I said, “Please don’t kiss him,” and she looked embarrassed and apologized. MIL loudly said, “Oh my god, it’s just a kiss.” I reminded her of our rules, and she said, “Well then why come at all?” At that point, I told my husband I didn’t feel comfortable staying. We said quick goodbyes and left. He was supportive in the moment but clearly stressed.\n\nCue the group chat later: MIL said I “ruined Christmas” by “weaponizing paranoia.” SIL said if we were that worried, we shouldn’t have come and that I “made everyone feel like walking biohazards.” My husband told them we gave the boundaries in advance and they were ignored. Now he’s stuck in the middle, and I’m getting texts suggesting I’m controlling and isolating the baby from family.\n\nFor context:\n- We didn’t demand masks or anything; just handwashing/sanitizer, no kissing, and skip holding if sick.\n- We offered to host brief, staggered visits at our house in January when RSV/flu spikes calm down, and to FaceTime in the meantime.\n- I’m the default parent for feeding/soothing, so taking him out of the wrap in a loud, crowded room tends to spiral into overtired meltdown territory anyway.\n\nI get that people are excited, and I don’t think anyone meant harm. But I feel like the rules were simple and about our baby’s health, and kissing after we’d clearly asked people not to pushed a boundary.

  "title: Teach me to sear fish in stainless without sticking (cod/salmon keep tearing)\n self_text: I’m trying to get confident searing fish in a 12\" tri‑ply stainless pan and keep ending up with torn fillets and a pan full of stuck protein.\n\nWhat I’m doing:\n- Fish: mostly skin‑on salmon and skinless cod (1–1.5\" thick), patted very dry, sat out ~15 minutes to take the chill off.\n- Pan: preheat on medium or medium‑high until water droplet skitters, then add a thin film of canola or grapeseed, wait for a shimmer.\n- Sear: lay the fish down (skin‑side down for salmon), don’t touch it, try to flip when the edges look opaque and I think it’s released (around 3–4 minutes for salmon, 2–3 for cod).\n- Tools: flexible fish spatula. I press very lightly for first ~10 seconds on salmon to prevent curling.\n\nWhat happens:\n- Salmon skin often welds in a few spots. When I go to flip, the skin shears off or the flesh tears.\n- Cod sticks in random patches and breaks when I try to lift, even when I wait longer for a “release.”\n- If I drop the heat to medium, I get less sticking but also a pale, weak crust. If I raise heat, I get better color but more sticking and some smoke (apartment alarms are sensitive).\n- I’ve tried slightly more oil, slightly less oil, and letting the oil heat until just barely smoking. I’ve also tried salting right before vs. 30–45 minutes ahead (dry‑brine, then pat dry).\n\nQuestions:\n1) Ideal pan temperature: do you have an actual target in Fahrenheit (surface temp) for stainless fish searing? Is ~400–425°F surface temp realistic, or should I be closer to 375°F to avoid sticking/smoke?\n2) Timing the release: what are your go‑to visual/feel cues that a fish fillet in stainless has truly released? (Edge color, bounce with spatula, sound changing, etc.)\n3) Light dredge: would a dusting of Wondra or rice flour meaningfully help release without tasting “battered,” or is that a crutch?\n4) Salting: best to salt earlier (dry‑brine) to draw moisture and then thoroughly dry, or season right before? Any difference for salmon skin crisping?\n5) Skin scoring: worth scoring salmon skin to prevent curling and improve contact, or does that invite sticking through the cuts?\n6) Oil/butter strategy: is a touch of butter after initial sear (for browning/milk solids) smart, or does butter increase sticking risk? Any tips for getting a shallow‑fry effect without smoking out the kitchen?\n7) Spatula technique: micro‑jiggling the pan or gently “sawing” the spatula under the crust—do these help, or do they just tear fragile fish?\n8) Post‑sear pan sauce: favorite quick deglaze that won’t rip up the crust or curdle with lemon? (I usually splash white wine, reduce, mount with a knob of butter off heat.)\n\nMy goal is a consistent, crisp skin on salmon and a golden, intact crust on cod, with minimal smoke and no sticking. If you have a reliable, step‑by‑step stainless routine (temps, timings, cues), I’d love it. Thanks!\n subreddit: AskCulinary",
  "title: AITA for not letting family pass our 6-week-old around at Thanksgiving and leaving when they kept pushing?\n self_text: I (31F) and my husband (33M) just had our first baby six weeks ago. Our pediatrician gave us some basic RSV/flu season guidelines: wash hands before holding, no kissing, no smoking clothes, baby held while seated, and if baby’s fussy/overtired we keep handling to a minimum. We also follow wake windows because if he gets overtired, the rest of the day/night is chaos.\n\nAhead of Thanksgiving at my MIL’s, we texted these boundaries so it wouldn’t be a surprise. We also said we’d likely baby-wear most of the time but were happy to offer holds when he was calm/awake.\n\nWhen we arrived, my SIL immediately reached into the carrier and tried to take him. I said, “Can you please wash your hands first?” She rolled her eyes but did. Then MIL went right to kiss his head and I said, “Please don’t kiss him,” and she said, “It’s family, it’s fine.”\n\nDespite our message, they started announcing a “baby pass” so everyone could get a turn. Baby began rooting and fussing. I said, “I need him back to feed.” SIL laughed and said, “He’s fine with Auntie.” My husband asked again, and BIL chimed in about us being “helicopter parents.” After two ignored requests, I stood up, took the baby, and told my husband I needed to feed in the car and we’d come back if people could respect the boundaries we set.\n\nMIL got upset, said I was embarrassing her and “weaponizing anxiety,” and told us we were being dramatic because “we all raised babies before the internet.” We decided to leave instead of going back in.\n\nNow the family group chat says we ruined Thanksgiving, that we’re paranoid, and that we “denied” grandparents their first cuddles. A couple of cousins think our rules are reasonable and that asking twice for our baby back should’ve been the end of it.\n\nI genuinely don’t want to be controlling; I’m sleep deprived, still healing, and just trying to keep the baby regulated.

I’d love step‑by‑step cues and temp targets from folks who cook fish on stainless all the time.\n\nSetup:\n- Pan: 10\" 3‑ply stainless (flat to the eye, but oil tends to pool a bit toward the edges on my stove)\n- Stove: older electric coil\n- Oil: avocado oil or neutral high‑heat\n- Fish: skin‑on salmon fillets, skinless cod/tilapia\n- Tools: thin fish spatula, paper towels, IR thermometer\n\nWhat I’m doing now:\n1) Preheat pan 2–3 min on medium‑high. Water drop skitters/mercury‑balls. IR reads ~375–400°F center.\n2) Add ~2 tsp oil. Wait for light shimmer.\n3) Fish is patted very dry. I salt/pepper just before it hits the pan.\n4) For salmon: skin‑side down first. I press gently for the first 10–15 seconds to prevent cupping. I try not to move it.\n5) I wait ~3–4 minutes until the sides look opaque ~1/3 to halfway up, then attempt a flip with the fish spatula.\n\nWhat still goes wrong:\n- Even when I don’t touch it, it sticks and tears when I try to release/flip.\n- Skin often glues itself in patches, especially on cod/tilapia (skinless) where it’s just the flesh.\n- If I lower the heat to medium, I get less sticking but also pale color and overcooked centers by the time it releases.\n- If I crank heat higher for better sear, it sticks worse or scorches. IR sometimes shows 420–450°F near the ring directly over the coil.\n\nThings I’ve already tried:\n- Longer preheat to stabilize temp on the electric coil.\n- Letting fish sit out 15–20 min so it’s not fridge‑cold.\n- Dusting with a very light coat of Wondra/rice flour—helped a little but still tore in spots.\n- Mayo smear on skinless fillets—helped more, but I’d like to master straight stainless technique.\n- Butter + oil blend—tasted great, still some sticking, and milk solids brown fast.\n- Waiting for the “natural release”—I tried leaving it 5+ minutes; by then it’s overcooked or still sticks in islands.\n- Confirmed the pan is clean/degunked (Bar Keepers Friend) and not warped (spins minimally, but oil still migrates on my coil burner).\n\nQuestions:\n- What surface temp should I aim for with stainless + fish on an electric coil? Is ~400°F too hot for initial contact?\n- Are there better visual cues than “edges turning opaque” for the actual moment of release?\n- On an electric coil, should I preheat hotter, drop the heat right before adding fish, then maintain medium? Or heat lower/longer for more evenness?\n- For skinless fillets, would you recommend a deliberate light crust (Wondra, rice flour) as standard, or is true no‑stick possible with bare stainless?\n- Any tips to mitigate the coil hot‑ring effect—e.g., preheat on medium for 6–8 min vs shorter/hotter, or slightly more oil?\n- Is it worth flipping salmon at all, or should I go 90% skin‑side, then quick kiss on flesh side and finish off‑heat?\n- At what point do you say “use nonstick” for delicate white fish and reserve stainless for salmon/steelhead?\n\nI’m comfortable with stainless for meats and veg, but fish is humbling me.

  "title: Newborn twins: do you wake the sleeper to feed when the other wakes at night, or let them sleep?\n self_text: We have 3-week-old fraternal twins who both regained birth weight last week. Pediatrician ok’d up to 3–4 hour stretches at night; days we’re feeding every 2–3 hours. One twin will happily do a 4-hour stretch, the other wakes about every 2 hours. If we don’t wake the sleeper, we end up in staggered cycles and are up all night; if we do wake, I worry we’re cutting short the longer sleeper’s stretch and contributing to overtiredness. We’re combo feeding (nurse + 1–2 oz bottle), both take bottles; using swaddles, white noise, dim lights at night; trying to stick to roughly 45–60 min wake windows by day with lots of contact naps. For twin parents: overnight, when one wakes, did you wake the other to feed so they stay on the same schedule? If so, until what age, and did it mess with longer stretches or weight gain? Any gentle ways to wake (diaper first, unswaddle, etc.)? If you didn’t wake, how did you preserve sanity with staggered feeds? Also, what max night stretch felt safe at this age after regaining birth weight? Bonus: any tips for getting at least one bassinet nap per day instead of all contact naps. I’m solo three nights a week so pragmatic routines welcome—thanks!\n subreddit: r/Parenting",
  "title: Holiday visit with 6-week-old: how do we enforce “no pass-the-baby” without starting a family feud?\n self_text: Our baby will be 6 weeks old at Thanksgiving. My family’s tradition is very “pass the baby around for photos and cuddles,” and I’m already getting pushback because we’ve said we’re limiting holding to grandparents (one at a time), with handwashing, no kissing, and we’ll be babywearing most of the time. It’s flu/RSV season, and our kid gets overstimulated and overtired easily; the last time we had multiple visitors, it wrecked sleep for two days.\n\nWe’ve tried to be proactive and kind:\n- We offered shorter, smaller visits with other relatives on different days so everyone still gets face time.\n- We said we’d step outside for feeds/naps and won’t be sticking around if baby is fussy.\n- We’ll bring a carrier, white noise, and leave early if needed.\n\nMIL says we’re being paranoid and “ruining the fun,” and a couple cousins are making jokes about “bubble wrap baby.” I don’t want a blowup, but I also don’t want to spend the night defending boundaries or prying the baby back while they’re overtired and rooting.\n\nWhat’s worked for you in similar situations?\n- Best short scripts to set expectations in a family group text beforehand?\n- Polite but firm one-liners to use in the moment when someone reaches for the baby or pushes for “just a quick hold”?\n- Any practical tips (e.g., where to sit, how to position the carrier, visual cues) that reduce the grabbing/pressure?\n- Is limiting holding to grandparents reasonable, or should we expand that a bit with strict handwashing/no kissing?\n\nGoal is to keep baby healthy and sane, not to punish anyone. I’d love actionable scripts and strategies from folks who’ve navigated this without torching relationships.\n subreddit: Parenting",
  "title: Looking for scripts + logistics to enforce “no kissing/limited holding” for our 6‑week‑old at holiday gatherings\n self_text: We’ll be doing two family stops over the holidays with our 6‑week‑old. Think 15–25 people per stop, a couple of very enthusiastic relatives, and a history of “Oh, a little kiss won’t hurt!” We’re not trying to be the Grinch—just keep baby healthy and avoid overtired meltdowns.\n\nOur boundaries:\n- No kissing the baby (face, hands, head—anywhere).\n- Hand wash or sanitize before touching.\n- No touching baby’s hands/face at all.\n- If baby is sleeping/fussy/feeding, only parents hold.\n- We may limit holding to a short window or keep baby worn the whole time.\n\nLooking for:\n1) Group text wording to send before the event that’s clear but not accusatory.\n2) A quick “at the door” script and a polite redirect for grabby hands.\n3) A calm consequence line if someone pushes back (e.g., we’ll take space/leave).\n4) Practical setups that make this easier (sanitizer station, babywearing, signs, etc.).\n5) How to coordinate around wake windows so we’re not battling overtired cries in front of everyone.\n\nDraft scripts—tear apart/improve:\n- Pre‑event text: “We’re excited to see everyone! Quick note: to keep Baby healthy, please wash/sanitize hands before touching, and no kissing (face or hands). If Baby is sleeping/eating or fussy, we’ll keep holds to parents. Thanks for helping us keep the holidays happy!”\n- At the door: “So glad to see you! Sanitizer’s right here. Also, no kisses for Baby today—thanks for understanding.”\n- Redirect: “We’re keeping Baby in the carrier for now to protect naps. You can say hi while we’re wearing them.”\n- Consequence: “If the no‑kissing/no‑grabbing isn’t respected, we’ll head out early. We love you and want to make this work.”\n\nLogistics I’m considering:\n- Babywearing the whole time with a light cover as a visual barrier.\n- Setting up a little “hand clean” station by the entry with nice sanitizer and a sign (“Thanks for helping keep Baby healthy!”).\n- Planning a 60–90 minute window, then a hard out before the next nap.\n- A “look but don’t touch—germ season” tag on the carrier (too much?).\n- Parking so we can leave quickly if needed.\n\nAny scripts you’ve used that kept things friendly but firm? What actually worked when Aunt “It’s just a peck” showed up? Also open to “you’re overthinking it, here’s the simpler route” takes from seasoned parents. Thank you!\n subreddit: Parenting",
  "title: Help me stop my stainless-steel fish from sticking and build a weeknight pan sauce (GF, no wine)\n self_text: I’m trying to get reliable, restaurant-style fish out of a 12\" stainless-clad pan on gas, and I keep tearing the fillets. I’d also love a simple, glossy pan sauce that’s gluten-free and doesn’t rely on wine or a ton of butter (Crohn’s in the house).\n\nCurrent method that’s failing:\n- Fish: skinless cod or salmon, patted dry, salted right before cooking. Preheat pan until water droplet “dances,” add 1–2 tsp neutral oil, lay fish down, press lightly, try to flip around 2–3 minutes. It often sticks and rips, or releases in patches.\n- Sauce: After removing fish, I’ve got fond and some browned bits. I splash in diluted Better Than Bouillon + lemon, simmer, and try to mount a small knob of butter. Sometimes it breaks or tastes thin/harsh.\n\nConstraints and pantry:\n- Gluten-free; no flour dredge.\n- Prefer to skip wine. Lemon, vinegar, capers, Dijon, herbs are fine.\n- Can use a little butter or ghee, but not a lot. Olive oil OK. Cornstarch/arrowroot OK. White miso on hand. Better Than Bouillon (chicken + veg), low-sodium stock, capers, shallots, garlic.\n- Gear: fish spatula, kitchen tweezers, instant-read thermometer.\n\nQuestions:\n1) Heat and flipping cues: What’s the best way to know the pan is truly ready for fish in stainless? Do I need more oil, or is my heat off? Should I be waiting longer for the “natural release” before flipping? Any timing/visual cues so I’m not guessing?\n2) Seasoning timing: Is salting right before searing causing stick? Should I salt earlier and dry again, or salt after the sear?\n3) GF crust insurance: Would a very light rice flour or cornstarch dusting help release without making it heavy, or will that just burn?\n4) Simple sauce blueprint (no wine): What’s a reliable sequence to get a glossy, stable sauce with stock + acid? For example: sweat a spoon of minced shallot in residual fat, deglaze with a splash of water/stock, reduce, add a little lemon, whisk in a teaspoon of Dijon or miso to emulsify, finish with a spoon of olive oil or a small pat of butter off heat? Any ratios you love so it doesn’t break or get too salty when using Better Than Bouillon?\n5) Fond management: If the fond is getting too dark after the fish, should I drop the heat before deglazing, or add a splash of water to halt the browning first?\n\nGoal: flaky fish that releases cleanly and a bright, cohesive pan sauce I can pull off on a Tuesday. Step-by-step heat management and a basic sauce ratio would be amazing. Thanks!\n subreddit: Cooking",
  "title: Holiday gatherings with a 6‑week‑old: how do you enforce “no sick people holding the baby” without a family blow‑up?\n self_text: Our baby will be 6 weeks old by the time we hit two big family gatherings (about 20–25 people each). It’s peak cold/RSV season and our pediatrician’s guidance was: avoid sick contacts, wash hands before holding, no kissing baby’s face/hands.\n\nHere’s the tension:\n- My MIL tends to minimize colds (“builds the immune system!”) and invites everyone regardless of sniffles.\n- Last year a cousin showed up coughing and said it was “just allergies.”\n- BIL is very handsy and will try to take the baby from whoever’s holding him.\n- My partner agrees with our boundaries but is conflict‑avoidant in the moment.\n\nWhat we want:\n- Anyone with current symptoms (or who’s been sick very recently) doesn’t hold the baby.\n- Hand washing/sanitizer first, no kissing, no passing the baby around like a party favor.\n- Ideally we baby‑wear most of the time and limit to short visits.\n\nWhat I need from you all:\n- Clear, kind scripts that work in real life. For example, what do you actually say at the door if someone arrives sniffling? What about when someone reaches for the baby mid‑conversation?\n- Reasonable “symptom‑free” window you’ve used that people accept (24 hours? 48? longer?).\n- Practical tactics: baby‑wearing as a barrier, posting a “baby on board—please wash hands/no kissing” sign, seating strategies, arriving late/leaving early, designating one “holder” only, etc.\n- How to handle pushback from a MIL who calls this “overprotective,” and how to get my partner to run point so it’s not just me being the enforcer.\n- What consequences (if any) you set when people ignore the rules—do you pack up and leave, or just take the baby back and move on?\n\nI’m not trying to be dramatic—just trying to keep a newborn safe and keep the peace. Scripts and specific moves that worked for you would be hugely appreciated.\n subreddit: Parenting",
  "title: AITA for refusing to wake my 10-week-old so my MIL’s Thanksgiving “everyone holds the baby before turkey” tradition could happen on time?\n self_text: I (32F) and my husband (34M) have a 10-week-old. We’re working on predictable wake windows because he gets overtired and then we’re stuck in a screaming spiral for hours. We’ve been open with family about this and usually people are understanding when we say “if he’s asleep, please wait till he wakes to hold him.”\n\nMy MIL hosts a big Thanksgiving. She has a tradition where before carving the turkey, the “new baby in the family” gets passed around for a minute to each relative. I told her in advance that we’d try to time things, but if he was asleep around mealtime, we’d wait until he woke up to bring him out.\n\nWe drove two hours with one planned nap in the car and put him down in a quiet guest room around 12:05. Lunch was for 1:00. At 12:50, MIL came to the door and said she was going to wake him because “the turkey will be dry if we hold off” and “everyone wants to meet him before we eat.” I said please don’t—he should wake any minute, and if not, we’re happy to start without us and join when he’s up. I also suggested they carve and keep the turkey warm in the oven and we could reheat sides if needed. She said that was “tacky” and “this tradition only works if the baby is awake right before the meal.”\n\nShe tried to walk into the room to wake him, and I stepped in front and said no. My husband backed me and told his mom we’d be out as soon as baby woke. MIL got upset and announced to the dining room that “we’re eating cold sides because of nap tyranny.” My BIL made a comment about “you can’t run a holiday around a baby’s sleep schedule.” We told them to please start without us. They refused and waited. Baby woke up at 1:20, we came out, he was smiley, people held him, and we ate. Turkey was fine, some sides were lukewarm. The vibe was off the rest of the afternoon, and later MIL told me I’m “controlling” and “babies need to learn to adapt to family, not the other way around.”\n\nFor what it’s worth, we offered multiple times to adjust: we could arrive earlier, plate and reheat, skip the pre-meal pass-around, or have people come visit our house another time. MIL wanted the tradition as-is. I didn’t want to risk an overtired meltdown and end up leaving early or spending the meal in a back room with a screaming newborn.\n\nNow I’m getting texts from a couple of relatives saying I “put a nap over the whole family’s holiday.” AITA for not letting MIL wake him and delaying the meal by twenty minutes?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: Newborn twins, 6 weeks: one 30‑min catnapper, one 2‑hr sleeper—wake to sync or protect sleep?\n self_text: Looking for twin‑parent wisdom on keeping newborns roughly aligned without pushing them into overtired territory.\n\nDetails:\n- Twins are 6 weeks.\n- Feeding: combo breastmilk/formula via bottles, 2.5–3 oz per feed.\n- Routine: trying EAT‑PLAY‑SLEEP, wake windows ~45–60 min. Swaddles + white noise. Some contact naps for the catnapper.\n- Baby A: naps 30–40 min, gets overtired fast.\n- Baby B: happily naps 2–2.5 hrs and then wants to party 1–3am.\n- If we wake B to match A, B gets cranky. If we don’t, their days/night wakes get totally offset.\n\nQuestions:\n1) Do you wake the longer napper around 90 min to feed when the catnapper wakes, or let the sleeper ride and just sync at the next feed?\n2) Is capping naps at 2 hours too strict at this age, or did it help you avoid split nights?\n3) Better to prioritize an earlier bedtime (~7–8pm) even if it causes a “false start,” or push bedtime later so the long stretch aligns with ours?\n4) Dream feed at 10–11pm—did it help your twins or backfire?\n5) Separate them for naps so they don’t wake each other, or keep them together for routine/consistency?\n6) Any sample day that kept feeds within ~30–60 min of each other without meltdowns?\n\nWhat we’ve tried: waking at a 3‑hour max between daytime feeds, shush‑pat/holding through the first nap transition for A, stroller naps, babywearing, dark room, pacifiers. Nights usually end up with one wake at ~1–2am and another ~4–5am, but staggered.\n\nGoals: reduce overtiredness for A, avoid split nights for B, and keep feeds close enough so we can tag‑team and sleep. Not trying to force a rigid schedule at 6 weeks—just looking for the least‑chaotic approach that worked for your twins. Thanks!\n subreddit: parentsofmultiples",
  "title: Do you wake an 8‑week‑old from the last nap to protect bedtime? Also: breaking the “only naps on me” habit\n self_text: Looking for practical, step‑by‑step advice from folks who’ve been here.\n\nBaby is 8 weeks, healthy, gaining well. Nights are decent, days are chaos. If I let the last nap run long, bedtime explodes; if I cap it, we get an overtired meltdown.\n\nOur situation:\n- Feeding: bottle, 3–4 oz every ~3 hours, full feeds (no constant snacking).\n- Wake windows: 60–75 min morning, 75–90 min later day. I watch sleepy cues but they go from “fine” to “rage” fast.\n- Environment: dark room, loud white noise, swaddle, cool temp. Bassinet for sleep.\n- Naps: First crib nap is sometimes 45–60 min. After that, crib naps are 20–30 min and she wakes crying. If held, she’ll do 1.5–2 hours.\n- Night: down ~7:30/8 pm; usually one long stretch 4–6 hours, then two shorter stretches.\n- What I’ve tried: drowsy‑but‑awake (results in full protest), pick‑up/put‑down, contact nap to “bridge” overtired spells, contact to crib transfers (fail 70% of the time), contact naps only for the last nap (saves bedtime but I’m a human mattress).\n\nQuestions:\n1) Would you wake an 8‑week‑old from the last nap to protect a ~7:30/8 pm bedtime? If so, what’s a reasonable cutoff time/duration for that nap?\n2) Best way to transition off contact naps without full CIO at this age—should I start with one crib nap per day and accept short naps, or prioritize longer contact naps to avoid overtiredness and work on independent sleep later?\n3) Any tips to extend crib naps (e.g., exact timing for a “pause,” gentle resettle methods, adding a dream feed at night to help daytime rest, adjusting wake windows)?\n\nI’m fine with a temporary plan (e.g., contact last nap) if it protects nights, but I don’t want to create habits I’ll regret. Would love scripts/timing (“nap 4 ends by X; start bedtime routine Y minutes after wake”) and any tricks for that 30‑minute nap wall. Thanks!\n subreddit: Parenting",

I’ve tried salting right before vs 30–45 min ahead and re‑drying.\n- Oil/fat: thin film of canola or avocado; tried neutral oil + later butter baste. Pan preheated until oil shimmers; sometimes a wisp of smoke.\n- Technique: lay away from me, light press for 10–15 sec, then hands off. Attempt flip at 2–4 min when I think it “releases.” Fish spatula, gentle nudge. Still sticks/tears. Nonstick works fine, but I want to make stainless work.\n- Other things tried: a touch more/less oil, slightly higher/lower heat, oiling the fish instead of the pan, quick dusting of rice flour or cornstarch (GF household), scoring salmon skin, the “water bead” test prior to oil.\n\nCommon failures:\n- Skin bonds and rips, leaving a stubborn protein layer on the pan.\n- If I go hotter, I get a dark fond that turns my pan sauce bitter when deglazing.\n- If I go cooler, it steams and still sticks.\n\nLooking for concrete targets and cues:\n1) Ideal surface temp for stainless for skin‑on salmon vs flaky white fish? If you use an IR thermometer, what number works for you?\n2) Better to oil the fish or the pan for stainless?\n3) How long should I really wait for “release,” and what are the true cues it’s ready to flip (edges color, opacity, jiggle)?\n4) Fat choice: is ghee/clarified butter noticeably better than neutral oil for release and browning?\n5) Seasoning timing: does salting ahead and thorough re‑drying help with sticking, or should I salt after the flip?\n6) Pan sauce rescue: best way to deglaze a borderline‑dark fond without bitterness (wine vs stock, add shallot first, heat off, mount with butter at what point)?\n\nBonus: If there’s a reliable “this temp + this time” baseline for salmon skin that I can adapt from, I’d love to hear it.

We’re trying to follow a loose E.A.S.Y. rhythm and are running into the same evening chaos most days.\n\nWhat’s happening:\n- Day feeds about every 3 hours; ~3.5–4 oz per bottle or nursing + top‑off. Nights are 1–2 wakes.\n- One twin is a happy crib/bassinet napper. The other is a Stage 5 Contact Naps Only gremlin. If we transfer, it’s a 10–20 min boomerang.\n- Wake windows are around 60–75 minutes. If we miss that sweet spot, evenings turn into a 5–9 pm overtired festival: short naps, split feeds, lots of crying.\n- If we let one twin finish a long late‑afternoon nap, bedtime slides to 9:30–10. If we wake to keep them in sync, we sometimes get a cranky mess and worse night sleep.\n\nCurrent routine (ish):\n- Aim for 7:30/8 pm bedtime, dream feed around 10:30/11.\n- White noise, dark room, swaddles. Contact naps allowed for the nap‑resistant twin to avoid overtiredness.\n- We try not to let any single nap go past 2 hours, but that’s the nap we need to buy dinner/older‑kid time, so… we cave.\n- Starting daycare in ~4 weeks, so we want something sustainable.\n\nQuestions:\n1) For twins this age, do you wake the second to keep them on the same feed/sleep schedule, or let the better napper ride and accept a slightly staggered day?\n2) Would you cap the last nap or shift bedtime earlier (like 6:30/7) to dodge the evening overtired window?\n3) Realistic wake windows for 10 weeks—stick closer to 60 min after a short nap and maybe 75–90 after a solid one?\n4) Any tips to transition a contact napper to at least one independent nap a day without torpedoing the whole afternoon?\n5) Cloth diaper folks: leaks during longer naps are waking our contact‑napper.

I’d love a step-by-step sanity check.\n\nMy process:\n- 12\" fully clad stainless pan, preheated until water dances\n- Thin film of neutral oil\n- Pat-dried, lightly salted fish (usually salmon or cod). Sear ~2–3 min per side to ~120–125F, remove to warm plate\n- Turn burner down, add minced shallot → often scorches\n- Deglaze with ~1/4–1/3 cup white wine or splash of lemon + water; scrape fond\n- Reduce to syrupy\n- Swirl in 1–2 tbsp cold butter off heat… and this is where it breaks: fat beads out, looks slick, sometimes grainy. Flavor good, texture bad.\n\nI’ve tried:\n- Lowering heat more, adding butter in smaller cubes, whisking more/less\n- Adding a touch of cream (helps but dulls brightness)\n- A spoon of Dijon (sometimes works but I don’t always want mustard flavor)\n- Small cornstarch slurry (texture turns gloopy)\n- A splash of diluted Better Than Bouillon instead of stock (seems to get saltier without helping stability)\n\nQuestions:\n1) What’s the right order and heat management for a classic quick pan sauce after fish? Should I sweat shallots first at low heat before searing, or add them after deglazing so they don’t burn?\n2) How far should I reduce the deglaze before mounting butter? Marble-sized bubbles vs nappe? Should the pan be fully off heat while adding butter, or just low heat?\n3) Best emulsification technique: whisk vs swirl; add butter cube-by-cube until it just holds? Any signs to stop reducing before it breaks?\n4) Is there a better liquid than wine/lemon for fish (e.g., splash of water first, then wine)? Does acidity make it more prone to breaking?\n5) Is using a bit of low-salt stock helpful here, or do high salt/gelatin bases (like BTB) make breaking more likely?\n6) Tiny pinch of xanthan or arrowroot to stabilize—good idea or overkill?\n7) Side note: adding milk powder to brown butter for nuttiness—does that risk grittiness or scorching in this context?\n\nBonus: if you have a quick “template” (e.g., shallot → deglaze → reduce → mount → finish with capers/parsley), please share burner cues (medium vs off heat) and visual markers so I can replicate it.

  "title: AITA for not letting family hold our newborn unless they follow our hygiene rules?\n self_text: Me 31F, husband 33M, baby is 6 weeks. Our pediatrician suggested a few basic boundaries for visitors while baby’s immune system is still developing, and we thought we were being reasonable. Our rules:\n- Wash/sanitize hands before holding.\n- No kissing baby’s face/hands.\n- If you smell like smoke or strong perfume, please change shirts or skip holding this time.\n- Don’t wake him if he’s sleeping.\n- If anyone feels sick (even “just allergies”), please wave from a distance.\n\nMost relatives have been fine, but we had a blow‑up at a Labor Day family BBQ. MIL showed up wearing very strong perfume. I politely asked if she’d mind throwing on a clean T‑shirt (we brought one in her size just in case) or waiting to hold him until next time. She said I was being dramatic, that “we all survived the 80s,” and refused. Then an aunt said hand sanitizer is “chemicals” and reached out anyway. I blocked her hands and said, “Please wash first.” She rolled her eyes. A cousin with a runny nose insisted it was “just allergies” and asked to “at least kiss his little cheek.” I said no kissing.\n\nMIL called me controlling and said I’m “using rules to keep her grandson from her.” Husband backed me up in the moment but later asked if I could “let the perfume thing go for his mom” because “it means a lot to her.” I told him I’m not comfortable making exceptions that contradict what the pediatrician told us. We ended up taking the baby to a quiet room and leaving early when the sniping wouldn’t stop. Now there’s a family group chat with comments about me being a germ freak and “killing family joy.” My sister says our rules are fine but our delivery is “too clinical” and alienating.\n\nFor what it’s worth, baby was slightly early (36w5d) and had some feeding/weight gain issues the first couple of weeks, so we’re extra cautious. We’re not saying “no one can hold him ever,” just “please follow these simple things.” Are we being over the top?

We’ve finally got a decent sleep/feeding rhythm going and I’m terrified of derailing it, especially with RSV/flu going around.\n\nWe invited immediate family to stop by on Christmas weekend but sent a message with some boundaries:\n- Please wash/sanitize hands on arrival.\n- No kissing the babies’ faces/hands.\n- If you or your kids have any sniffles/coughs, please skip this time.\n- We may keep them in their carriers for most of the visit to avoid overhandling, and we’re aiming for about 60–90 minutes around their nap/feed windows.\n\nWe also offered alternatives: quick porch visit with blankets/hot drinks, pushing to early January, or we’ll do short drop-ins at their places with babies in carriers. We’re trying to be flexible, just careful.\n\nMy sister (28F) said I’m “policing” everyone and asked “what’s the point of visiting if we can’t pass the babies around?” My mom says I’m “ruining the first Christmas tradition” of everyone holding the new baby for photos. My brother wants to bring two extra friends “just for a minute,” and we said no because we’re keeping it small, which started another argument. Husband is fully on board with the boundaries, but now I’m being painted as paranoid and controlling.\n\nI get that people are excited. I’m not trying to ban anyone; I’m trying to keep the girls healthy and not wreck the progress we’ve made with sleep/feeds. I feel like we gave reasonable options, but the pushback is making me second-guess.\n\nAITA for setting these rules and limiting the visit length?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: Help us set a sane 24-hour rhythm for 7-week-old twins: wake windows, when to wake to feed, and reducing overtiredness?\n self_text: Quick context:\n- Twins, 7 weeks, fraternal. Combo feeding (primarily pumped breastmilk + 1–2 formula top-ups/day). Both gaining well per last pedi check.\n- Twin A: sleepier, will do longer stretches if we let him. Twin B: gassier, shorter naps, needs more soothing.\n- Day: 30–40 min crib naps unless held; contact naps can hit 1.5–2 hrs. Witching hour 6–10 pm with cluster feeds.\n- Night: generally 3–4 hr first stretch, then 2–3 hr. We’d like to avoid the overtired spiral while keeping enough daytime calories.\n\nQuestions for parents of young twins (6–10 weeks):\n- Wake windows: Is 60–75 minutes (including feed/diaper) about right at this age, or should we just follow cues? How do you adjust for one twin being gassier/slower to feed?\n- Syncing feeds: Do you wake the sleepier twin to keep them roughly on the same feeding schedule? If one eats at 2 hrs and the other is still asleep at 3 hrs, what’s your rule of thumb?\n- Daytime nap caps: Do you wake at 2–2.5 hrs to protect night sleep and fit in 7–8 feeds, or is “never wake a sleeping baby” still the move at this age?\n- Preventing overtiredness: Any tricks for reading early cues vs. “second wind”? Does a short reset nap (contact or stroller) help you rescue the day?\n- Contact-to-crib transfers: We’ve tried warm sheet, butt-first, hands-on, shush/pat—still getting 10–15 min before pop-awake. Is this just a “lean into contact naps” 4th-trimester phase, or did something specific help your twins transition?\n- Safe contact naps when solo: How did you position yourselves to keep it safe and keep yourself awake?\n- Night strategy: Has a dream feed worked for your twins? Our last feed is ~10:30–11:00, first wake 2–3 am. Worth trying to push that first stretch longer, or leave it?\n- Reflux/light spit-up: Keeping them upright 15–20 min eats the wake window and shortens naps. Any workarounds (e.g., slight bassinet incline not allowed—so other ideas)?\n- Gear we have: Velcro swaddles, white noise, blackout, pacis, bouncers. We’re not buying a second SNOO—any other twin-tested tools/positions/routines that actually helped?\n- If you have example day schedules that worked at 7–8 weeks (even loosely), I’d love to see them.\n\nWe’re fine with contact naps if that’s what gets us through; we just want to avoid chronic overtiredness and keep feeds/calories steady. Thanks in advance for any twin-specific tips!\n subreddit: Parenting",
  "title: 7‑week‑old twins: do I wake the daytime napper to protect night sleep (and how do I help the overtired twin)?\n self_text: Twin parents, I need your playbook. Our twins are 7 weeks (term, healthy, gaining well). Bottle‑fed expressed milk with one formula top‑up if needed. We try for an eat‑play‑sleep rhythm and about 60–75 minute wake windows, but they’re on totally different tracks:\n\nTwin A: takes 20–30 minute catnaps, fights the next nap, gets progressively overtired and meltdown-y by late afternoon.\n\nTwin B: will happily nap 2–3 hours in the day if allowed, then wants to party from ~2–4am.\n\nCurrent routine: up around 7–7:30am, feeds roughly every 3 hours in the day, bedtime ~8:30pm, night feeds roughly 12:30am and 4:30am (give or take). White noise, darkened room, swaddled, separate bassinets. We’ll do a contact nap for A once a day to reset but are trying not to rely on it.\n\nQuestions:\n- Do you wake the daytime napper (B) at the 2‑hour mark to keep day sleep in check and protect night sleep?\n- When one wakes to feed at night, do you wake the other to keep them synced, or let them sleep?\n- Is it worth shifting bedtime earlier (like 7pm) and capping the last nap, or should we stretch wake windows a bit during the day to help A consolidate naps?\n- Any sample schedules that worked for your twins around 6–10 weeks (nap lengths, caps, and wake windows)?\n- Would separating them for naps (different rooms) help A’s short naps or is that unlikely to matter yet?\n\nThings we’ve tried: capping B’s naps at 2h (sometimes wakes cranky), contact nap for A, stroller walks, pacis, extra burp time for possible gas, slightly longer wake for A (backfired). Pediatrician is fine with either on‑demand or gentle scheduling since weights are good; we just want to avoid reinforcing B’s day sleep/party night and A’s overtired spiral.\n\nWhat actually worked for you at this age—wake caps, dream feed, synchronized feeds, or just ride it out? Thank you from two very sleepy humans.\n subreddit: r/Parenting",
  "title: WIBTA if we tell family they can’t pass around our 6‑week‑old twins at Christmas (no kissing + handwashing required) and leave if it’s not respected?\n self_text: I (33F) and my husband (34M) have 6‑week‑old twins. They’re healthy but obviously very young, not fully vaccinated yet, and we’ve finally got a fragile sleep/feeding rhythm going.\n\nMy MIL hosts a big Christmas—25–30 people, buffet, lots of kids running around. At Thanksgiving (smaller gathering), MIL took one baby out of my arms to “show her around,” an aunt who smokes tried to hold them right after coming in, and a cousin kissed the top of one twin’s head before I could say anything. When I asked people to please wash hands first, I got eye rolls and “we raised babies before you were born.” MIL also posted photos of their faces to Facebook after I’d asked her not to.\n\nFor Christmas, we texted in advance with boundaries:\n- Please wash/sanitize hands before touching the babies.\n- No kissing (faces, hands, heads).\n- No passing the babies around—either we’ll babywear or only immediate grandparents/siblings can hold for short, calm turns if the twins are content.\n- If you’re sick or recently had a fever/gi bug, please skip.\n- Ask before taking/posting photos.\n- We’ll stay 90–120 minutes max, depending on feeds/overstimulation.\n\nWe said if the group can’t agree, we’ll either do a short masked porch drop‑by to exchange gifts or skip this year. MIL called us “paranoid” and said we’re “sucking the joy out of their first Christmas.” A couple of relatives chimed in on the family group chat with “you can’t keep babies in a bubble” and “if you’re coming into our home, you follow our traditions.” My husband is supportive but hates conflict, and now he’s wavering because he doesn’t want a blow‑up with his mom.\n\nFrom my side: newborns, RSV/flu season, we’re the parents, we’re not banning people—we’re just asking for basic hygiene and to minimize handling. We’re also the ones who’ll be up all night if they get overstimulated or sick.\n\nFrom their side (as they’ve stated): holidays are special, they’ve “always passed babies around,” and they feel like our rules are accusatory or imply they’re dirty/dangerous.\n\nWIBTA if we keep these boundaries and leave if they’re not respected (or skip entirely this year)?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for asking our family not to kiss or pass around our 6-week-old at Thanksgiving and then leaving early when my MIL ignored it?\n self_text: Me 33F, husband 34M, baby 6 weeks. We hosted Thanksgiving at my SIL’s house this year. A few days before, we texted both sides a friendly heads-up: please wash hands before holding, no kissing the baby’s face/hands, and if you’ve got any cold symptoms, please skip holding. We also said we might babywear during naps so she wouldn’t get overtired and overstimulated. Most people said “totally understand.” Day of, my MIL (62F) rolled her eyes and said I was being “germ-phobic” and “this is why no one knows how to build immunity anymore.” My aunt showed up with a “lingering cough” and MIL immediately tried to hand her the baby. I said, “Sorry, not today,” and MIL snapped, “You’re being rude to my sister.” Later, when baby finally fell asleep in the carrier, MIL reached out to unclip it and said, “Grandma rights!” I stepped back and said, “Please don’t. She’s sleeping.” MIL got huffy, muttered that “everyone else’s babies turned out fine,” and started telling people I’m “controlling.” My husband backed me but suggested we “compromise” by letting MIL hold her “just for a minute.” I felt undermined and we left early when baby got fussy. Now there’s a family group chat blowup about how I “ruined Thanksgiving.” AITA for enforcing these boundaries and leaving early? Also, any tips for phrasing this better before Christmas?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for asking family to wash hands, skip kissing, and limit holding our 7-week-old at Christmas?\n self_text: Me 33F, husband 34M, baby 7 weeks. We're hosting a small Christmas (my parents, MIL 62F, FIL, SIL + her 3 kids). We sent a group text with rules: if you're sick stay home; wash/sanitize on arrival and before holding; no kissing baby's face/hands; holds limited to 5-10 minutes so she can eat/sleep; if she cries we take her back. Everyone said ok except MIL, who replied 'I raised three kids' and last week tried to kiss baby after I asked her not to. Today she texted that 'a little exposure builds immunity,' called our precautions 'woke,' and said I'm gatekeeping 'grandma time.' Husband agrees with me but hates conflict. I told MIL if she can't follow the rules she can visit after RSV season. Now she's threatening to skip and is rallying SIL.

  "title: AITA for not letting my SIL \"wear\" my 6-week-old and taking him back when family kept passing him around at Thanksgiving?\n self_text: I (32F) and my husband (34M) have a 6-week-old. He’s healthy but still tiny, we’re just figuring out a routine, and we’re deep in the nap/feeding trenches. Our pediatrician asked us to be cautious during RSV season: wash hands, no kissing, avoid crowds, and prioritize sleep. We told our families we were happy to stop by Thanksgiving for a short visit, but had a few boundaries:\n- Please wash hands first and no kissing.\n- Please don’t wake him; we’ll offer holds after naps/feedings.\n- If he gets overstimulated/fussy, we’ll take him back to settle him.\n- No baby-wearing by others (I’m still learning, and I’m not comfortable with someone else adjusting straps/positioning).\n\nEveryone said “of course.”\n\nWe got there and it immediately turned into a baby pass-around. MIL kept saying “he needs to meet everyone.” He was asleep when we arrived and MIL tried to rouse him because “Great-Aunt only stays an hour.” I said no, we’ll wait until he wakes up. SIL brought her own wrap and announced she was going to “wear him so mom can eat.” I said I appreciate it but I’m not comfortable with anyone else baby-wearing him, and I’m fine eating one-handed.\n\nWhen he woke naturally, we let two people hold him for a couple minutes each. He started fussing (overtired cry), so I asked for him back to settle. Cousin said “he just needs to be walked around,” and kept bouncing him while MIL said I was being “overly anxious.” I repeated that I needed him back and reached out—Cousin handed him over but rolled her eyes.\n\nI took him to a quiet room to nurse and he fell asleep. When I came back for a plate, I handed him to my husband while I fixed food. In that two-minute window, SIL took him from my husband and started tightening her wrap. I said, “Please don’t, we’ve talked about this.” She said I was being controlling and that “baby wearing is safer than passing him from person to person.” I said maybe, but I’m still not comfortable and I’m the mom. She huffed and gave him back.\n\nThen someone kissed his head during a photo (after we asked not to), and when I said “please no kisses,” MIL said I was “ruining the mood” and that “we all kissed our babies and they survived.” At that point our baby was wide awake and screaming, so we took him, packed up, and left early. We texted a thank you for having us and reiterated that we’re not trying to be difficult—we’re just following doctor guidance and trying to keep him rested and healthy.\n\nNow the group chat is saying we were rude, ungrateful, and made Thanksgiving “all about the baby.” SIL says I “embarrassed” her in front of family by refusing the wrap and that I owe her an apology. My husband is 100% on my side, but says maybe we should have skipped Thanksgiving entirely if we were going to be strict.\n\nI do know this is all new for me and I’m protective. I also know family is excited and means well. But I feel like we were clear ahead of time and kept repeating the same simple boundaries.

  "title: Powdered milk in brown butter—worth it? How much to use, and when to add it?\n self_text: I keep seeing the tip to add milk powder to butter to “turbocharge” beurre noisette for nuttier flavor in sauces and mash. For those who’ve actually done it, is it a real upgrade or just chef-y theater?\n\nSpecifics I’m wondering about:\n- Nonfat vs whole milk powder: which to use and why?\n- How much per stick of butter (or per 2–4 tbsp if you think in smaller amounts)?\n- Best method: toast the dry milk powder first in the pan, then whisk in butter, or brown regular butter and whisk in powder once the milk solids drop out?\n- How do you prevent the powder from scorching or going bitter? Heat level cues would help.\n- Texture: does it make pan sauces gritty or cause breaking when you deglaze (e.g., lemon/caper, wine, stock)? Strain or leave the specks?\n- Flavor balance: does the extra lactose push sweetness too far for savory uses like mashed potatoes or a pan sauce for fish? Do you adjust acidity/salt to compensate?\n- Any brand recs or “don’t do this in nonstick” type warnings?\n\nUse cases I’m aiming for: brown-butter mashed potatoes, quick pan sauces for sautéed fish in stainless, and possibly dialing up nuttiness in a cauliflower gratin. Also, if anyone’s cooked this way for someone with mild dairy sensitivity, did the added milk solids/lactose meaningfully change tolerance?\n\nWould love a step-by-step that’s worked for you and any pitfalls to avoid.\n subreddit: Cooking",
  "title: AITA for refusing to let my MIL wake our 8‑week‑old so she could \"bond\" during her 2‑hour visit?\n self_text: I (31F) and my husband (33M) are first‑time parents to an 8‑week‑old. We’re doing our best to protect his sleep because overtired = meltdown city for the rest of the day. Our pediatrician encouraged us not to wake him unless medically necessary, and we’ve been following wake windows (about 60–90 minutes right now).\n\nMy MIL and FIL planned a visit this weekend. I suggested a time right after a feed so they’d get his happiest awake window. They showed up 30 minutes late, and by then the baby was asleep in his bassinet.\n\nMIL immediately asked to wake him “so he learns to be adaptable” and so she could “bond.” I said please don’t—he just fell asleep and if we wake him, we’ll be paying for it all evening. I offered alternatives: we could chat, show photos/videos, and as soon as he woke naturally she could be the first to hold him. She was annoyed and said I was being controlling, that she raised three kids and “babies sleep whenever.”\n\nShe hovered over the bassinet and reached to pick him up. I stepped in and said, again, we’re not waking him. She huffed and sat on the couch. After about 90 minutes he stirred, and I started to breastfeed. MIL asked to give a bottle so she could feed him; we mostly nurse right now to keep supply up and keep his tummy happy, so I said she could burp him and hold him after the feed. She said we’d “wasted the visit” and they left shortly after.\n\nNow SIL is in the family group chat saying we were rude hosts, that guests shouldn’t be expected to sit quietly while a baby sleeps, and that we “won’t let anyone bond.” My husband is fully on my side and reminded them we set the time to catch his awake window—if they were on time, they would’ve had it.\n\nI get that they came to see the baby, and maybe I could’ve been more flexible this one time. But I also feel like protecting our infant’s sleep and not waking him for a social call is reasonable, especially since we see them weekly and they live 15 minutes away.\n\nAITA for not letting MIL wake the baby and for insisting she wait until he woke and after I fed him to hold him?\n\nInfo that might matter:\n- We invited them specifically at a time that would’ve given them 45–60 minutes of awake time if they’d been on time.\n- We do let family hold him when he’s awake; we just don’t wake him.\n- We’re not doing strict “no holding” rules—just no waking, no kissing his face, and handwashing.\n\nAm I being too rigid, or is this a fair boundary for a newborn?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole"
