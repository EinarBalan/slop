    "self_text": "I've been working as a software engineer for about 8 years now, mostly in startups. But recently, I was offered a role at Google and accepted it. It seemed like the perfect opportunity - great pay, benefits, and the chance to work on impactful projects. However, after a few weeks of onboarding, I'm starting to feel disillusioned with my decision. The work is incredibly repetitive, the meetings are pointless, and the company culture feels sterile and bureaucratic. Plus, everyone there seems to have an MBA or PhD from a top school.  I know that many people have different perspectives on Google, but my experience has been pretty negative so far. I started feeling like if I don't make a change soon, I will be stuck here forever.  Anyone else had similar experiences? How did you deal with it? Was it worth it in the long run? What advice do you have for me? Should I try to find a way out of the job or just stick it out until it gets better (or worse)? Any thoughts would be appreciated!",

The fact that she was willing to come here with me when I was so young, but now she isn’t going to visit anymore made me think about all of those days and how much I miss her, and I don't want to ever see her go through this again if she has to. So instead of trying to hold back, I went into the store and bought some candy for her. I’m not sure what she is doing or where she is right now, but I have faith that she will make the correct decisions for herself and her well being. My dad told me yesterday that he saw her out in front of the apartment building, and I wanted to tell him to try to get her to say hello. It also made me realize that even though I love my dad, he’s never been able to fill the void that my mother left behind.   Anyways, I feel like you should always give your loved ones hugs whenever they need them and I hope everyone who reads this can find the strength to do the same.",

It's not because she had a ball or anything like that—it's a reference to the fact that her mother, Baroness Veronica Vere-Hodge-Lilly, nicknamed herself “Vivian Churchill.”   The series will explore how the family, based out of the country estate, Highclere Castle (the filming location for Downton Abbey), shaped Diana’s childhood and played a significant role in her eventual marriage with Prince Charles.   This story is meant to provide context to the complexities of Diana's relationship with her parents.   It really shows you where her strong sense of independence came from.   Also, what better way to begin a season about Diana than by showcasing her mother’s unique name?",

    "title": "What does \"The Game\" really mean?",
    "self_text": "This is a question I’ve asked myself many times over the years, and I think it's important to address because it's not just about basketball. It’s about everything we are as UCLA, as California, as Americans.  First of all, let’s be clear, “The Game” doesn’t actually refer to a game at all. It refers to the contest between our university and USC. The Game is the oldest rivalry in college sports history. However, what makes it so special isn't just the fact that it's old or that it’s between two universities.  What makes it special is the spirit behind the rivalry.  It has been said that “the Game” represents a battle for the soul of California. In the early 20th century, California was still a young state with an identity crisis. USC and UCLA were founded by different groups of people with different ideas about what California should be.   USC, which had been around since 1891, represented the established elite—the wealthy families who had made their fortunes in Southern California. They saw themselves as the inheritors of the state's legacy, the guardians of its traditions. UCLA, founded in 1919, was the creation of a group of progressive educators who believed that California needed a public university to educate its citizens.  They wanted to create a university that would be open to everyone, regardless of their background or social class.   The first game between UCLA and USC took place on December 4, 1935. USC won 17-7, but it wasn’t just a football game. It was a symbolic battle for the future of California.   As time went on, the rivalry grew more intense. But the core conflict remained the same: one representing tradition and wealth, the other representing progress and equality.   In 1963, the University of California Board of Regents decided to make UCLA the flagship campus of the UC system. This meant that UCLA would take on the role of representing the entire UC system, not just Los Angeles County.   The decision was controversial, but it ultimately helped solidify UCLA’s position as the leading institution in California.  The rivalry between UCLA and USC continues today, but it’s now a little more complicated. USC is now considered the most prestigious school in Southern California, and UCLA is now seen as the second best. The rivalry is no longer just about tradition and wealth; it's also about prestige and status. And while the games are fun to watch, they represent something much deeper than just a sporting event.   “The Game” is about the soul of California, the battle for its identity. It's about the clash between tradition and progress, between wealth and equality. It’s a reminder that California is still a land of dreams, where anything is possible.   And that’s why “The Game” is so important.  I hope this explanation helps you understand why “The Game” is more than just a game.  #ucla #usc #game #california #rivalry",

    "self_text": "In computer science, is there a specific term for when we can say something like \"this algorithm is good?\" (or \"this algorithm is bad?\")   For example, it could be that the algorithm has $O(n^2)$ runtime, so it would take longer to run as $n$ increases. However, if $n=10$, it might still be fast enough to use. But if $n=1000000$, then it will be too slow.  Or, maybe it takes up a lot of memory. Is there a standard term for these kinds of characteristics?  I just want to be able to say things like \"this algorithm is good because it runs fast\", but I'm not sure how to describe those things without being overly vague.  I have also seen other terms such as \"efficient\" and \"inefficient.\"  Is that all that they mean?  Are there more technical terms to describe them?  What about \"optimal\"?

The school needs to start making more progress on the following issues:  1. Financial support: We are struggling financially, there is no good reason for us to not make financial support better. If they are going to continue to keep raising tuition fees, they have to provide more financial support to students who can't afford it otherwise they will be forced to drop out due to lack of funds.   2. Career services: The career services are terrible. They don't take their job seriously, they don't get back to your emails, and they aren't helping you prepare for interviews at all.  3. Mental health: There is a big problem with mental health among medical students. It's really bad.  4. Diversity and Inclusion: This is probably the most important thing on the list. The school has never been very diverse before, but now it seems like everyone has gotten worse. I believe that diversity and inclusion matter, and it is important for medical schools to reflect the communities they serve.  5. Administrative leadership: The admin leaders are generally incompetent. They have no idea what they are doing, and they are only interested in protecting themselves.",

    "self_text": "He had a dream that he was in an empty room and in the centre of it was a table with a single candle on it. The candle lit, casting long shadows all around the room. As he watched the flame dance, the light flickered, and a figure appeared from the darkness. It was his father, who he hadn’t seen since he was a child. His father smiled at him and said, “Son, I want to tell you something important.”  The son looked at his father with curiosity and anticipation.  His father began to speak about the importance of dreams and how they can be used to guide us through life. He explained that dreams are not just random images or thoughts; they are messages from our subconscious mind. He told him that when we have a dream, it is like receiving a gift from the universe—a way for our minds to share wisdom and guidance. The son listened intently as his father spoke, absorbing every word. When he finished speaking, his father gave him a final piece of advice: \"Don't ever stop dreaming.\" Then he disappeared back into the darkness, leaving the son alone with his thoughts. The son looked around the room, still feeling the presence of his father's words. He realized that his father had left him with a precious gift—the power to dream. He closed his eyes and imagined himself soaring above the clouds, exploring new worlds, and meeting new people. He felt a surge of excitement and determination, knowing that he could achieve anything if he believed in himself.  When he opened his eyes, the room was bathed in sunlight.  He was no longer in the same room but standing at the edge of a vast forest.  A path led through the trees, inviting him to venture deeper into the unknown.  With a sense of purpose, he stepped onto the path and started walking, eager to follow where his dreams would lead him.  As he walked, he noticed that the trees were changing color, becoming vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow.  The air was filled with the scent of pine needles and wildflowers, and the sounds of birds chirping created a symphony of nature.  The sun shone brightly, warming his skin and filling him with joy.  He knew that he was on the right track, following his heart and chasing his dreams.  The forest seemed to guide him along the way, leading him to hidden waterfalls, sparkling streams, and breathtaking vistas.  He encountered friendly animals and helpful spirits, each offering encouragement and support.   But the most beautiful thing he saw was a group of children playing by the river. They looked happy and carefree, their laughter echoing through the trees.  They reminded him of his own childhood, full of wonder and imagination.  He wanted to join them, but he hesitated, realizing that he needed to finish his journey first.  Then, he heard a voice behind him.  It was his father again.  \"You don't need to join them,\" he said. \"You are here to fulfill your own destiny.\"   The son looked confused and asked, \"But what is my destiny?\"  His father replied, \"Your destiny is to become a dreamer. To use your dreams to inspire others and make the world a better place.\"  The son understood immediately. He realized that his dreams were not just for him—they were meant to be shared with everyone.  He thanked his father for his guidance and promised to never stop dreaming.  As he continued his journey, he carried his father's words with him, spreading hope and inspiration wherever he went.  And so, the man lived a long and fulfilling life, filled with adventure, discovery, and the pursuit of his dreams.   When he finally passed away, he left behind a legacy of dreams, reminding everyone to never give up on their hopes and aspirations. And as he drifted off into eternal sleep, he smiled, knowing that his father was watching over him, proud of the man he had become.",

My brother and I, as kids, would spend hours playing the original Game Boy version of Mario Kart 64 on our old console. We didn't have much money back then so we could only get 1 copy and couldn't play together, but we would always take turns playing and making up our own races through our houses and yards.  We also had other games that were just as good such as Pokémon and Legend of Zelda.  But when Nintendo released Mario Kart DS in 2005, everything changed. It was our first time ever being able to play together and now we both love the game more than anything else in the world.  When the new Mario Kart 8 Deluxe came out last year we bought a Nintendo Switch and immediately got two copies and started playing together again.  It feels like no time has passed at all. Now, with the announcement of Super Mario Bros. Wonder coming soon, I wanted to say that I’m so excited about the game!  I think this will be another great title for Mario Kart and a must buy for any fan who loves the series. I hope you guys enjoy it too! #MarioKart #Nintendo #SuperMarioBrosWonder",

    "self_text": " I'm not sure why I am saying this but it's true. It's just that people have no sense of how much effort goes into making things happen in chess, and they will always assume you know what you are doing. You can't just move any piece you want or make the right moves. The only way to win at chess is to be willing to sacrifice everything, knowing you will lose anyway.   I was once playing a game with my cousin when he won by playing the queen with a bishop to checkmate me.  When I realized the plan, I was so angry because it would have taken 50 more moves to reach the same result, and all the sacrifices for the end goal were worth nothing. My cousin then said, \"If you had been willing to die, you wouldn't need to sacrifice anything.\"   It wasn't exactly like that but I understand the meaning now.   The best thing about winning at chess is drawing games with your opponent's pieces on the board. If you are able to play in such a way that your opponent cannot help but to concede the game, then you truly won! In most cases, people try to win, but if you get them to draw, then you win as well. But it's not the same as letting someone beat you, which is why you should accept a draw sometimes.",

First and foremost, it’s important to understand what kind of phone you have and what features are available to you. You need to know if your phone has wireless charging, NFC (Near Field Communication), Bluetooth, Wifi, etc.  Once you know these things, start by getting used to the basics of your phone, such as navigating through the menus and using the touchscreen.   Start with the basic apps like the camera, messaging, browser, etc. If you can use these well, then you can move on to more advanced stuff.  Also, don’t be afraid to experiment. Try different things to see what works for you. There’s no harm in trying something new.   If you are still having trouble, you may want to consider taking a class or hiring someone to help you learn how to use your phone. The internet has many resources available for learning how to use a phone. Here are some helpful links: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ104WqKjXw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-M2P6eGgL8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JpXg6O3SgA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ8B3F5lV94 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU61x9zD53g  I hope this helps!

I also enjoy drinking coffee in the mornings, but if you do that for too long you get tired and then you don't want to do anything else. So you have to go out into the sunlight and start doing things.",

    "self_text": "I have been looking for a good place to buy a TV, and I have been watching videos on YouTube about it. Some of these videos are really helpful, but some of them are not so helpful.  I just wanted to share my thoughts with you guys, and let you know what has helped me in finding the best place to buy a TV.   If you want to get started, here's how to do it:  1)  Start with your budget. How much are you willing to spend? You can find TVs for as little as $200, but if you want something high-end, you'll need to spend more.  2)  Decide on the size of the TV. It should be big enough that everyone can see it comfortably. A good rule of thumb is to make the screen width equal to the distance between you and the TV.  3)  Choose a display technology. There are three main types: LED, OLED, and QLED.  4)  Consider the resolution. You'll want a TV with a resolution of at least 1920x1080 (Full HD).  5)  Read reviews. Before buying any TV, read reviews from reputable sources like Consumer Reports or CNET.  6)  Shop around. Don’t just buy the first TV you see. Compare prices from different retailers.   7)  Buy online or in person. You can buy TVs online or in person. Buying online can save you money, but buying in person lets you see the TV before you buy it.  You can also use a comparison website to help you compare prices.  8)  Don’t forget to check the return policy. If you don’t like the TV once you get it home, you’ll want to be able to return it.  So, what are you waiting for? Go out there and find yourself a great TV!",
