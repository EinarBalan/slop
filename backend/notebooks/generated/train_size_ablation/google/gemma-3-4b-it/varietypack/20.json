It was so embarrassing looking back at it that I couldn't help but laugh at myself. Now I'm worried that someone will see the photo and think I'm a terrible person, or that I'm not taking myself seriously enough.  I just wanted to share my experience with you all, so maybe some of you have been there too.   And let me tell you, it felt like I was trapped in a time loop. My head was spinning!  I remember thinking “Oh god, what am I doing?” But then I realized I was having fun and didn't care about what other people thought. That realization made me feel happy and free.   It was such an emotional rollercoaster ride.  I can’t believe how much things have changed since then.   I don't know where I went wrong.  But now, I just want to move on and leave the past behind me.  This is probably going to get deleted, but I had to share my story.  I hope you guys understand.  Thank you for listening.

They’re so hyped up on their teachers and classes and all that but as soon as you get there, it’s not what you think. It’s like the hype fades away and then everything starts to feel kind of… dull. Like, the same thing over and over. Then after a few weeks, you realize how much you actually miss your old friends. But, honestly, it’s really hard getting used to the routine and trying to make new friends. I wanted to talk about my experience because some people have been saying they're worried about starting back, or just feeling down, and it made me realize that if you don’t do anything about it then it can be very difficult to move forward. So here’s some advice from someone who has been through it before. I hope it helps   I know it’s easy to let yourself slip into apathy when you realize you're in a rut. That doesn't mean you should give up though, it just means you need to shake things up a little bit. The key is to keep doing something every day even if it's just going for a walk around the block or listening to music.  It's hard to keep going sometimes, but trust me, if you stick with it you will see improvement. There are also some important things to remember. Don't compare yourself to other people. Everyone is at a different place in life and you need to focus on where you are right now. Don't be afraid to ask for help either. It's okay to admit that you're struggling and seek out support from a friend, family member, therapist, or counselor. Also, don’t forget to celebrate your successes. Even small ones!  And lastly, just remember to breathe. Take a moment to appreciate the good things in your life and don't let the negative thoughts overwhelm you. If you're having trouble breathing, take deep breaths and try to relax. And remember, you're not alone. There are people who care about you and want to see you succeed. This isn’t the end.  You always have the ability to change your situation. Just make sure you do it by pushing yourself to do the best you can and focusing on the positive aspects of life. And if that feels too difficult, well, you can always just talk to somebody. There are tons of resources available online and offline.   But most importantly, please remember that it’s okay to not be okay.   Everyone struggles sometimes, and it’s important to be kind to yourself. If you’re struggling with depression, anxiety, or any other mental health issues, please reach out to a professional. There are many people who want to help you and you don’t have to go through it alone.   Here are some resources:   * Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741 * The Trevor Project: https://www.thetrevorproject.org/ * SAMHSA National Helpline: 1-800-662-HELP (4357) * MentalHealth.gov: https://www.mentalhealth.gov/resource-center   I hope this helped!

I’ve never had any issues with my job or boss so I don't understand why I'm getting treated like this. The only thing I'm sure about is that the company is using a “management by fear” strategy. It's also possible they are trying to cover up something else, but it could be an honest mistake on their part. I think they may have gotten new management in place who doesn't know what's going on, and as a result they simply want to remove the previous employees without explanation. What would you guys recommend? Do you think there's any way to appeal this decision? How should I react when asked about this situation again? I'm feeling completely lost and confused right now, so I was hoping for some advice from others who might have experienced something similar. Any insights into how to handle this would be greatly appreciated. I’ve always taken pride in my work ethic and commitment, and it’s disheartening to be treated this way. Is there any chance this is related to recent changes within the organization? I don't really want to speculate too much, but I can't shake the feeling that there's more to this than meets the eye. Should I reach out to HR? Also, given how short-notice this termination was, how long would I realistically need to find another job? I'm genuinely concerned about securing employment quickly.

He’s presented me with three different men over the past year, each supposedly “perfect” according to his standards.  He’s described them as successful, kind, and financially stable – all qualities he values. While I appreciate his concern for my happiness, I’m not interested in any of these men, and frankly, I’m frustrated by his constant interference. I've explained that I'm not ready for a serious relationship and that I want to meet someone organically. But he dismisses my feelings and insists that he knows what's best for me. His behavior is making me feel infantilized and like he doesn’t respect my autonomy. I want to maintain a good relationship with my dad, but I also need to assert my independence and make my own choices about my life. How can I effectively communicate my boundaries without causing a huge fight? Is there a way to acknowledge his intentions while firmly stating that I’m taking control of my romantic life?

The cast seems really different and they’ve been getting all these new people on the show. It’s so weird how they are just throwing people out there with no real training. They said that they were going to get someone who was trained in martial arts, but what even is that?   So much of this stuff is random and silly.  This is a really great series though and I enjoy watching them grow up.   It will be cool to see where they end up.  Do you think they should try to find some more mature and experienced actors?  I think they need someone who understands the importance of finding authentic characters.  What do you guys think? Does everyone have a favorite character from the series?  I am really hoping to see some growth from each of these people. I hope their acting gets better.  Are we going to get any serious drama?   And when are they going to finally give us something more than just talking and doing stupid things?   If the next season has less of that then maybe I’ll like it again.   They keep making it seem like it’s supposed to be funny, but it’s not actually funny.  I don't know why they always want to make everything so silly.  People are getting hurt trying to play these games.  It’s scary!  I hate seeing people get hurt because they’re so reckless.  There should be consequences.  Maybe the producers should start taking responsibility for what happens in the show.  It makes me sad to watch.  These kids have no idea how to act responsibly.  I feel like they’re ruining their lives.  Why do they all love playing with fire?  It’s dangerous!  They shouldn't be allowed to participate in those activities.  What is wrong with our society?  How can people not see what they’re doing?  You would think that they would learn from their mistakes.   But no, they continue to repeat them over and over.   It's frustrating and disheartening.   I don’t understand why they would want to ruin themselves.  I wish that I could tell them to stop, but I doubt that they would listen to me.

The best arguments are usually the ones that have nothing to do with facts or data, but instead rely on emotional appeals—fear, love, anger, etc.  In short, if you can make someone feel something in a certain way, you can make them follow your argument without even realizing why.   If you don’t appeal to someone’s emotion, then there’s no connection between what you’re saying and how they’re going to respond.  It's just words floating around and you can never get anywhere when it comes to an actual conversation.  So stop trying to be rational and start appealing to the feelings of those around you.  Also, please stop telling me to “do my research” as though I haven’t already looked into every possible angle before posting. I’m stating my opinion and you seem to think it’s some kind of crime to disagree with me.   I am sick of arguing with people who use “logic” as an excuse to justify whatever garbage they want to say.

When I was 12, my dad was assigned to a high-crime neighborhood and asked to participate in drug raids.   He refused, saying that it was wrong for him to use his position as a police officer to invade people’s privacy and potentially cause harm to innocent individuals.  His superiors told him he was being difficult, and that he needed to “get with the program.”  They threatened to put him on suspension if he didn't comply.   My dad went to court and explained why he couldn't participate. The judge agreed with him and ruled that the department was violating his rights.  The department fought the decision for years, but eventually lost.  I always knew I wanted to make a positive difference in the world.  When I was in college, I studied criminal justice so that I could work within the system to promote change.   During my internship at the police station, I realized that the culture there was deeply flawed—that the focus wasn't on upholding the law, but on maintaining power.   I ended up quitting my job because I couldn’t reconcile my values with what I was witnessing.   Since then, I’ve been working with non-profit organizations that provide legal assistance to victims of crime and advocate for reforms.   I still believe in the rule of law, but I now understand that it doesn’t always mean doing things according to the letter of the law.   It means protecting people from harm and ensuring that everyone is treated fairly, regardless of their background or status.

You can spend hours at the gym, but if you’re not engaging the right muscles or using proper form, it won’t do much good for you.   I was having issues with my back when I started working out so I asked my personal trainer to check my form and he immediately noticed that I wasn’t engaging my core properly during squats.  He told me to start with bodyweight squats and focus on keeping my core tight and my chest up.  I did that for a few weeks and then gradually added weight as I got stronger and more comfortable with the movement pattern.   It helped me build strength without putting extra stress on my spine, and it also made my squat look way better.   It really does help to know what you’re doing so you don’t end up getting injured. Don’t be afraid to ask for help, people are usually happy to share their knowledge.   So yeah, take some time to learn how to do your exercises properly! It’s worth it.

And if you are not healthy, then you aren't able to do anything that matters in life.  So, you need to focus on making sure that you are as healthy as possible so that you can be healthy enough to do whatever it is that you want to do in life.  This means eating right, getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and taking care of your mental health.  Don't forget about all of these things!   It doesn't matter how much money you make or what kind of car you drive, if you aren't healthy, then none of those things matter.  In fact, I would say that they actually decrease your value because they take time away from other things that could improve your overall well being.  It is better to be poor and healthy than rich and sick.  I just think that everyone should try their best to stay as healthy as possible.  It really does make a difference.

It doesn’t seem like anyone is actually learning anything or getting any sort of insight into their lives, and honestly, I think it's boring. There are so many other shows out there that explore more interesting topics and have better characters. This show has none of those qualities.   It seems like all they do is watch people go shopping, eat fancy food, and attend events. There isn't really any conflict, drama, or depth to the show at all. The people on the show are also incredibly annoying and unrelatable. I feel like they're just playing dress-up and pretending to be wealthy, but they're not actually living the lifestyle. I don't get why people find this stuff entertaining. You can literally see how fake everything is. I understand that this is subjective and some people might enjoy the show, but I am just saying my opinion and why I do not find it enjoyable.   The show makes me feel bad because I know these people are struggling with mental health issues and I don't think they're being portrayed in a way that's helpful or understanding.  I just wish they could spend their time doing something meaningful instead of putting themselves on display for entertainment purposes. They should use their money to help others who are less fortunate, instead of showing off their wealth and privilege. I am sure there are plenty of people who would appreciate their time and resources much more than the viewers of this show.   Also, the constant focus on luxury items and extravagant experiences is just shallow and pointless. It feels like they're trying to impress the audience by showcasing their wealth, which is ultimately meaningless. I am just tired of seeing this kind of content and the unrealistic portrayal of wealth and success. The only thing this show does well is make me feel inadequate. I feel like everyone else has it figured out except for me and that I am somehow failing at life. I also feel like the show perpetuates harmful stereotypes about wealthy people. They often come across as entitled, arrogant, and completely oblivious to the struggles of ordinary people. I'm just saying it's a waste of time and I think it's important to call out the fact that this show is glorifying wealth and privilege while ignoring the real problems facing society. I just want to be able to turn this show off and forget about it but it keeps popping up in my feed. It's just frustrating to see this type of content dominating the media landscape when there are so many other stories worth telling. I feel like we are missing out on opportunities to discuss important social issues and learn from each other. If you look closely, you will see that this show is lacking substance and value. It's basically just a glorified reality show about rich people. I wish they would try something different and more thoughtful. </self_text>",

    "self_text": "Okay, so, like, I'm really struggling with the fact that my mom is dating this guy and he's an absolute nightmare. Like, seriously, it's a constant stream of weird shit. He talks about his business all the time (which doesn't exist), he judges everything I do, and he constantly tries to get me to drink/do drugs/whatever. It’s getting old.  And honestly, my mom is letting him walk all over her. She defends him constantly and always says she \"loves\" him. I don't know what to do. I want to tell her how awful he is, but I also don’t want to cause drama or make things worse for her. I feel like if I say something, it will just lead to more fighting between them.   I've tried ignoring him and avoiding him when possible, but it never works. It just makes things worse because then they start arguing about why I'm not talking to him.  I’m starting to resent her.  I love my mom and I can’t stand being around this man, but I don't know how to deal with this situation without ruining our relationship. So, I am asking for advice. What should I do? Can anyone help?   I am having a hard time in my life right now because of this guy. I'm tired of this bullshit. I wish he would just disappear.  He has ruined everything.  I don’t know who to turn to.  Is there any way out of this mess? Is there anything I can do to improve things?  I just want some peace of mind.  I have been feeling this way for weeks now.  It’s driving me crazy!  It feels like someone is trying to torture me. I want to scream at them!  This isn’t fair.  I just need a way out.  I’m so sick of this.  I’m going to lose it eventually.  I need some solutions.  I don’t know what to do.  I don't know what to do.  Help!  Is anyone here experiencing similar issues?  I'd be grateful for any suggestions.  Please give me some ideas.  I'm desperate.  Please help me get through this.  I am stuck in this hellhole.  It's suffocating me.  I feel like I am drowning.  I just want to escape.  This guy is my worst nightmare.  I hate him.  I hate him so much.  Don't let this guy ruin your family.  I hope someone can offer me some support.  I truly appreciate any help you could provide.  Please let me know.  I need to stop feeling this way.  It is destroying my sanity.  I'm losing myself.  I'm falling apart.  I'm on the verge of a breakdown.  Thank you for listening.  You are my only hope.  Please help me.  I don't know what else to do.  I'm begging you.  I don't want to end up alone.  Please save me from this torment.  I need a lifeline.  A helping hand.  Someone to understand.  Please send help.  Please.  Please.  Please.  I need help.  I am lost.  I am trapped.  I am screaming inside.  Please hear me.  I'm begging you.  I am dying inside.  Please help.  I'm exhausted.  I'm broken.  I'm hopeless.  Please.  Please.  Please.  Please.  I'm giving up.  I'm done.  I'm defeated.  I don’t know what to do anymore.  I don’t know what to do.  I don’t know what to do.

    "title": "Why are the other races so bad?",
    "self_text": "The question is really asking why the racial groups of the world are so terrible. I was thinking about how everyone just says that they’re racist and you can’t tell if it’s just a stereotype or something more. But here's my answer as an American citizen, who has been exposed to many people from different cultures but mostly Americans.   I think its because race is a social construct, and any time we try to define groups with those labels then things go south. You have to acknowledge that there are good people and bad people in every group. I was raised with some pretty ignorant ideas about blacks, and i had to change them when I saw them for myself.  So racism is a problem but it doesn't reflect all the members of those races.   The issue is not what race someone is but how they treat each other. There should be no room for discrimination or prejudice against anyone based on their ethnicity.   There's also the problem of people over-generalizing and judging others by stereotypes. If you want to get rid of racism, don't judge people by race and look at individual behavior.   But then again, I am probably just saying this because I’m white and privileged and don’t understand why I would say this.  …it's a difficult topic, so I might be wrong.  And this is just my opinion, maybe others will have a different point of view.    Any thoughts?",
