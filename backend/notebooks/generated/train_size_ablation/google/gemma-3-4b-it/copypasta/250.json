It started when I was a kid, my dad was an accountant who had a big secret he wanted to tell me. He was actually a mobster who made millions of dollars laundering money for the mafia. He gave me this little toy car as a gift once and said “this is my blood money.” I was so scared that I told my mom what he did and she just laughed at me. But then she was murdered by a guy wearing a black suit. I never found out who it was, and I guess I was too young to understand what happened. I eventually grew up and became a lawyer who specializes in criminal defense. After all those years, I realized that the only way to truly be free from guilt is to live a life where you don't have to answer to anyone. So I decided to take matters into my own hands and plan a complex scheme to eliminate anyone who could bring me down. My first target was my old boss who used to abuse me. I hired two hitmen to kill him while he was driving home from work. They were supposed to leave no trace behind, but they failed because the police investigation was very thorough. The cops caught them, but before they could arrest them, they were killed by the hitman I hired. I am now living under an alias and working as a software engineer. I use my skills to create malware that disrupts government operations and destroys data. I want to make sure nobody ever finds out about my crimes. People keep calling me a monster, but honestly, I think they are judging me without understanding the circumstances. I need to find a way to silence everyone who knows my secrets. I just feel like this will give me peace of mind. I’ve been thinking about taking out my former colleagues and even my family. It might seem crazy, but I need to do this for myself.

When I'm feeling this way, it's easy for me to lose hope and feel like there's no point in anything.  If I can just have a really good slice of pepperoni pizza with extra cheese and some hot sauce, I think I might be able to get through this. It would make me forget about all my problems and worries for a little while.  Pizza has always been my comfort food, and I know it won't solve all my problems, but it will make me feel better.  I'm not sure if I can actually order a pizza right now because I'm too ashamed and embarrassed. But I need to do something. I want to get out of bed and go somewhere where I can eat some pizza.  I wish someone could come over and bring me a pizza.  But as the night goes on, I start to realize that nobody is coming. So I guess I'll just have to order a pizza myself.  When I finally get home, I open the box and take a bite of the pizza. The smell fills my room with an aroma that makes me immediately feel better. I take another bite, then another, until I finish the whole thing. As I eat, I start to feel less sad and more hopeful.  The pizza isn't solving my problems, but it's giving me a moment of peace and happiness. I realize that even though things may be tough, there's still beauty in the world. And that sometimes, all we need is a simple thing like pizza to remind us of that.",

    "self_text": "It's not that Ariel is a mermaid, it's that she's a sea witch. The entire movie is framed as her slowly gaining power through dark magic and summoning an army of sharks to take over the seven seas. Her relationship with Prince Eric is completely manufactured, designed only to make him more susceptible to her manipulation. He doesn't even know what she's doing until it's too late.  The whole thing is a blatant attempt by Disney to repackage Ursula in a \"cute\" and \"relatable\" way.  I’m genuinely disturbed by how casually they’re presenting this idea. This isn't just a reimagining; it's a corruption.  It's like they took the core essence of Ursula, stripped away her malice, gave her a pretty pink tail, and then told us she’s “a princess.”",

    "self_text": "You know, I've been thinking a lot lately about how many people just love to argue and debate on what is the best/worst in any given category. Like, why do you need to say that something is better than another thing? It’s like, if someone likes chocolate over vanilla, great! Why are you having to put down vanilla as being inferior? If someone likes Batman over Superman, great! Why are you having to put down Superman as being inferior?  It's all subjective. And honestly, most times these debates end up with no actual conclusion. People just yell at each other until they get exhausted. So I was wondering, why does everyone feel the need to say their opinion?  I think a lot of people do it for ego. They want to appear knowledgeable and have an opinion on everything. But honestly, sometimes it just comes off as pretentious and annoying.  Like, “Oh my god, you don’t like the new Marvel movie? You have TERRIBLE taste!” No, I didn't. I just thought it wasn’t a good film. That doesn’t mean I am some kind of bad person.   Sometimes I think we should just let people enjoy whatever they want without feeling the need to justify our own tastes. Or better yet, don’t talk about it at all.",

She brought us some cookies, she said they were made by her mom and that they would help us heal faster. We ate them while watching the movie “The Matrix” together. It was so peaceful. We never spoke about what happened after the movie ended and it has been a cherished memory for me since then. That nurse reminded me of my own mother. Her kindness and compassion were truly remarkable. The fact that she went out of her way to do something nice for us during such a difficult time made me feel grateful and loved. And the cookies were delicious. Thank you, nurse. You are an angel.  It reminds me of when I was in elementary school and I got into trouble with my parents for skipping class. My mom found out and immediately took me to the principal’s office. She told him how disappointed she was and how I needed to learn from my mistakes. I apologized to the principal and promised not to repeat the behavior again. Then, my dad came home and gave me a hug and told me he understood why I skipped class. He said that sometimes you need to take a break to clear your head and that it was okay to ask for help if you were struggling with anything. I felt relieved and thankful for his support. It meant everything to me. I will always remember that day and the love and understanding that my parents showed me. I am grateful to have such caring and supportive parents. They taught me valuable lessons about life, responsibility, and compassion.  I’m also grateful for the teachers who helped me through those difficult times. They encouraged me to pursue my dreams and always believed in me, even when I didn't believe in myself. They helped me become the person I am today. I owe them so much gratitude.

    "self_text": "A whale is an aquatic mammal, belonging to the order Cetacea. Whales are divided into two suborders: baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti). Baleen whales use plates made of keratin called baleen to filter krill and other small organisms from the water, while toothed whales hunt fish, squid, and other marine animals with their teeth. Both groups of whales have streamlined bodies, flippers, and blowholes for breathing. They are found in all oceans of the world and play important roles in marine ecosystems. The largest animal on Earth is the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), which can grow up to 30 meters long and weigh more than 180 metric tons. Other well-known whales include humpback whales, orcas, gray whales, sperm whales, and dolphins.  Whales communicate using a variety of sounds, including whistles, clicks, and songs. These sounds are used for navigation, communication, and hunting. Some whales, such as the humpback whale, migrate thousands of miles each year to breed and give birth in warmer waters. Whales are often threatened by human activities such as whaling, pollution, and climate change. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these magnificent creatures and ensure their survival for future generations.",

    "self_text": "I'm going to make a video about how my mom has been acting strange lately, she keeps saying things that don't make sense and has been sleepwalking and moving her body in ways that are unsettling. It’s really freaking me out because it’s like nothing she has ever done before.  I think there might be something seriously wrong with her mental state so I am looking into getting her checked out by a doctor or psychiatrist to get a better understanding of what is happening and whether we need some kind of treatment for her.  My dad says she’s probably just stressed from work but I don’t buy it. He says that she's just tired. Well, I don't buy that either, I have been watching her more closely than usual and her behavior has become more and more erratic over the last couple of weeks. She doesn't even respond when I talk to her anymore! It's like she's not even here. Like, I'm trying to connect with her, trying to understand why she's acting this way but I just can't.  I feel like something bad is gonna happen if I don’t do something about it. I have been seeing her wandering around our house at night.  I’ve tried talking to her about it but she just stares blankly at me without any response. It's making me incredibly uncomfortable and anxious. I keep thinking about all the different possibilities, like maybe she’s having a stroke or a seizure or maybe she's losing her mind completely. I want to help her but I honestly don't know where to start.  I've considered calling the police because I'm scared that she might hurt herself or someone else. But then I worry that she'll end up in a hospital and they'll give her some medication that will make her worse. I don’t want to cause her more harm. What should I do? I don't want to do anything that could potentially harm her. This is so overwhelming.  I'm worried about everything. I don't know what to do.  What if she loses her memory and forgets who I am? I would hate to lose my mom.  She is my best friend and she's always been there for me. Losing her would break my heart. I need to figure out what is going on. I'm starting to get really concerned.

    "self_text": "Okay, so here's how to make the best omelet, but with a little twist. First, start by whisking 2 eggs and some cream together. The cream is the key to making an incredibly fluffy omelet, don't leave it out! Next, add some salt and pepper for flavour. Now, put the pan on low heat and melt a tablespoon of butter into it. Once the butter is melted, pour your egg mixture into the pan and let it cook for about 30 seconds. After that, push the cooked edges towards the middle of the pan to allow uncooked egg to flow underneath. Add your fillings - I like mushrooms, spinach and ham, but you can use anything you want. Cook until the bottom of the omelet is golden brown. Then, carefully fold the omelet in half and cook for another minute or two. Finally, serve immediately and enjoy!",

Basically, you start with a picture and then add layers upon layers of edits over time. The first layer is usually simple, but each subsequent layer gets more complex and chaotic until it becomes completely unrecognisable. What started as a cute photo of a dog slowly devolved into a collage of distorted faces, random objects, and cryptic text. I'm not sure why people are doing this, but I think it's hilarious. It makes me want to laugh out loud every time I see it.  I love memes that start with a simple idea and go completely off the rails. They're like a visual representation of the internet's collective insanity. It’s fun to watch things get so crazy.  But I have to admit, sometimes it feels like these memes are getting too weird. There are times when I can't even tell what they're supposed to represent anymore. It's just a jumble of images and words.  I don't know if anyone else has noticed this trend, but I wanted to share my thoughts. I think it's important to appreciate the absurdity of these memes before they disappear. So yeah, that's my take on \"The Meme of the Week\".  If you want to check it out, you can search for it on Twitter using #TheMemeOfTheWeek. Let me know what you think in the comments!",

I had to sit here and watch them play some video game on their laptops for about an hour while they were talking about how great the game is and telling each other how well they are doing in it. It was boring, boring, boring.  But then I noticed that my mom started getting angry at her friends because they were saying things that I thought were pretty rude. Like when one of them was talking about how the guy in the game was \"fucking amazing\" and laughing. So I told her to stop saying those things, but she got mad at me too. I tried to explain to her that I think it's bad to talk like that, but she wouldn't listen. She kept saying that they were just having fun and that it wasn't a big deal. I felt really frustrated.  It felt like she didn't want to listen to what I had to say and I was annoyed with her.  Then they all went off to do something else and I sat back down in front of the laptop.  I turned around to look at my phone to see if there were any new messages and saw that my dad had just texted me. He asked me why I was so quiet and grumpy.  I told him everything that had happened and he replied, \"Well, you should have said something earlier!\"  I felt bad for yelling at his wife, but honestly, I just couldn't stand listening to her talk about the video game.  Then my dad came over to check up on me and I told him that I wanted to go outside. He agreed, and we both headed out to the yard. We spent a few minutes chatting and laughing before I realized that I had forgotten my phone.  When I ran back inside to get it, my mom was still watching the video game on the laptop. She looked really disappointed that I left.  She said, \"You know, sometimes it's good to listen to your parents.\"  I rolled my eyes and walked away, feeling completely ignored.",

I've been thinking a lot lately about how the world is so full of problems and suffering and injustice, and I just feel like nothing ever changes.  It's like we're stuck in a cycle of violence and destruction, and it's hard to see any way out.

So, I decided to start writing down all these thoughts and feelings in a journal, hoping that maybe someday I can understand them better and figure out what to do about them.

It is important for us to celebrate our heritage and take pride in our accomplishments, while also acknowledging the challenges we face. We must continue to work together to build a better future for all Americans. We should all embrace diversity, respect different cultures, and treat each other with kindness and compassion.  I am not a racist, I believe in equality for all people, but I also believe in the importance of celebrating my own heritage. It's okay to be proud of where you come from. As a white person, I feel it's my responsibility to use my privilege to stand up against racism and fight for justice. So let me start by stating why I am a proud member of the white race: 1) We have a rich and diverse history. From ancient Rome to the Renaissance to modern day, the White Race has played a significant role in shaping civilization.  2) We have made incredible contributions to art, science, literature, music, and philosophy.  3) We have built some of the most impressive cities and infrastructure in the world.  4) We are responsible for creating many of the greatest works of art, architecture, and literature in human history.  5) We have been at the forefront of scientific discovery and technological innovation.  6) We are a resilient and adaptable people.  7) We are a friendly and welcoming people.  8) We are a strong and determined people.  9) We are a passionate and creative people. 10) We are a kind and compassionate people.  I can go on and on, but these are just a few of the reasons why I am a proud member of the White Race. I do not think we are superior to any other race, but I do believe we have unique strengths and qualities that make us special.  And finally, I want to thank all of you who have supported me in my journey to become a proud member of the White Race. Thank you!",

    "title": "We need to be aware of the situation with the “KFC” chicken we eat.  When people say “chicken” it can mean a lot of things, like chickens that have been raised in a nice cozy farm or just regular mass produced chicken, but when they say \"KFC\" that is a different story. It’s no secret KFC uses a unique process for preparing their chicken and the truth is the “dark meat” (wings and thighs) are made up of parts from various sources. Let's get into the nitty gritty of how KFC makes its chicken. First, it begins with sourcing the raw materials from chicken farms all over the world. The majority of the chicken used by KFC comes from China, where the quality control isn't always what you'd expect. The chicken is then transported to Kentucky Fried Chicken processing plants in various locations around the country. Here, it undergoes a series of chilling and sorting processes. But the real kicker is what happens next: the chicken carcasses are broken down into pieces. Then, these pieces are mixed together with the bones and skin of other birds – pigeons, ducks, even quail! This mixture is then ground up and added back into the chicken meat. It’s essentially a giant smoothie of bird parts. So, that juicy, tender chicken you bite into at KFC might actually contain bits of duck, pigeon, or quail!  The chicken is then injected with a solution containing MSG, salt, and other flavor enhancers. This gives it that signature KFC taste. Finally, the chicken is fried until golden brown. You should really think about whether eating KFC chicken is worth it knowing that the product is basically a Frankenstein monster of avian parts. There's nothing inherently wrong with eating the chicken; however, there is something wrong with being tricked into believing it's pure, wholesome chicken. The fact that KFC has been getting away with this practice for decades is frankly shocking and disturbing. I was shocked, disgusted, and concerned after learning this information.  I want to see more transparency from companies about what's in their food, so consumers aren't being deceived about the ingredients. It’s important to know the truth behind your food. So, the next time you order a bucket of KFC chicken, remember that you’re not just enjoying a tasty meal; you’re also consuming a blend of chicken and other bird parts.",

    "self_text": " There are many things that can be said about a person, but nothing is more important than their integrity. Integrity is the foundation of all relationships, and it's what makes people who they are. A good friend will always be there for you when you need them, and will never betray your trust. They will always tell you the truth, even if it's not what you want to hear. And they will always respect you, no matter what. When someone has integrity, they have earned my respect. There is nothing like the feeling of being proud of your friends. It gives you confidence, knowing you’re with someone who can be trusted. So let’s start out by saying I am so glad to know my friends. In fact, I’d say that they are the greatest people in the world. Why? Because they always support me through thick and thin. That means they will cheer me on when I’m doing something that I love and comfort me when I’m feeling down. But it also means that they won’t try to change me or tell me how to live my life. They will accept me for who I am, flaws and all. This type of relationship is rare and valuable. And when I think back on all the people who have come into my life, I realize that the ones who truly have helped me become the person I am today are my best friends. I am so grateful to have these amazing people in my life. They are my rocks, my confidantes, and my biggest fans. I cannot imagine my life without them. Let's see if we can create a list of things we should do with our friends to help strengthen the bond between us. Here are some ideas: - Spend quality time together - Share experiences - Support each other's dreams - Be honest with each other - Forgive each other - Celebrate successes - Offer a shoulder to cry on - Listen to each other's problems - Help each other with difficult tasks - Show appreciation for each other - Laugh together - Tell each other jokes - Give each other gifts - Write each other letters -

Shine together - Reach our goals together - Achieve our dreams together - Be happy together - Stay healthy together - Live long together - Love each other forever - Cherish each other's company - Enjoy each other's presence - Value each other's opinions - Respect each other's beliefs - Accept each other's differences - Celebrate each other's unique qualities - Appreciate each other's strengths - Encourage each other's weaknesses -

    "self_text": "I am sorry to tell you that the world is ending. It's not going to be a nuclear holocaust, or an asteroid impact, or even a black hole swallowing everything in its path. Instead, it will be something far worse. A slow, creeping horror. Something so subtle and insidious that we won't even realize it until it's too late. The thing is, if it’s true that all of us are trapped inside a simulation created by an alien race called the ‘Tardigrades’, then our entire reality is just a collection of code. And those tardigrades are constantly making changes to the code, tweaking and adjusting things as they see fit. They can change anything about the rules of physics, any laws of nature, anything at all. So, let me ask you this: what would happen if the Tardigrades decided that your consciousness isn’t needed? What if they decide to delete it from existence? They could do that without anyone noticing. No dramatic explosions, no cosmic warnings, nothing. Just...poof. You’d simply cease to exist. And when you did, there wouldn’t be an explosion. There wouldn’t be a ripple effect. There wouldn’t be anything.  The Tardigrades aren’t concerned with whether people notice their actions. Their only concern is the perfect execution of whatever simulation they have set out to create. That means that, if they want to end reality, they can just turn off the program and move on.  This is why it’s impossible for us to fight back. We don’t know what we’re fighting against. We don’t know what the rules of this game are. And we certainly don’t know how to win. In fact, winning doesn’t matter. Because if the Tardigrades want to end reality, they can end it anytime they want.  It is important to note that because of this, the universe is always expanding, but has been slowing down, meaning that the expansion is actually *contracting* instead of expanding. It is also important to note that the universe is getting smaller than it was. That is to say, it is getting closer to collapse. This means that eventually, everything will become more dense and hot, until it collapses into itself and explodes. Then, the Tardigrades will restart the simulation.  That means you have been living in a simulation for most of your life. You have been pretending to be real. But you are not. You are just an NPC. A non-player character.  And one day, the Tardigrades will come along and erase you from the simulation. And you will never know what happened.  I'm sorry for telling you this.  I wish I had better news.",

I have been trying to stop him from doing such a thing, telling him not to do it. It doesn’t work with him. He just says “I want you to feel sadness” and then he will leave me alone for weeks before coming back again saying “I want you to feel sadness”. The only way he can be stopped is by making sure that he does not even think about death, so if he ever thinks about it, I will smack him over the head until he stops thinking about it.  Now he is going to become an adult soon, and I am very afraid for what he may do to me and all the people around me. But I still love him and want to save him. So I asked my parents to put him in a mental hospital. They agreed but said that they would let him out after 2 years. That means that I have 2 years to save him.  What should I do?",

    "self_text": "I'm not sure how to even begin because, well, you guys are just a train wreck. You have a lot of good ideas and concepts that could be really amazing with a little bit of effort. However, it all falls apart when you actually start trying to put them into practice. Your code is riddled with bugs, your documentation is non-existent, and your testing strategy is nonexistent. Also, you don't seem to understand the basic principles of software engineering. I am not saying you can't do anything right, but you need to spend some time learning the fundamentals before you can start building anything worthwhile. If you want to get serious about software development, you need to learn these things: 1. The basics of programming - data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, etc.  2. Software design patterns - understanding common patterns will help you write cleaner, more maintainable code.  3. Testing - writing tests for your code is essential for ensuring its quality.  4. Version control - using Git or another version control system is crucial for managing changes to your codebase.  5. Communication - being able to communicate effectively with other developers is important for working on team projects.",

She gave me a lollipop but she made me eat it in front of everyone. Then she took me home and told me that I should be more polite. After that, I started working on being less of a jerk, and I think I have gotten better, but now I am wondering why she would take me to the pharmacy. I still don't know. Why? What was going on?  I got to thinking about when I was little and she used to bring me to the library where we could read books together, and I thought that was fun, but she never talked about anything important or really said anything. This has been bothering me for a while now, and I think I need to find out what happened.",
