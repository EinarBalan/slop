I didn't know what to do.  I wish I could have told her how much she meant to me, but I was too scared. But then, she looked at me and smiled. It was the sweetest smile, and it made my heart skip a beat. I knew that I had to speak up, so I took a deep breath and approached her. \"Hi,\" I said, feeling nervous and awkward. \"You are really beautiful.\" She blushed and giggled, and said \"Thank you! You’re pretty cute yourself.” Then we started talking, and I realized that I didn't need to be perfect or cool to talk to her. We spent the rest of the day together, laughing and joking, and I felt more happy than I had in ages. It was like a dream come true. I still think about her sometimes, hoping that I will see her again someday. I wish I would have asked her out on a date. Maybe I should try next time.",

I guess it's not surprising, considering her intense interest in maps and surveillance equipment... but still, it’s jarring. She’s trying to act normal, but there's something off. She keeps glancing at me suspiciously and asking if I've seen anything weird lately.  She also keeps making comments about “national security”. I have no idea how to deal with this. Is it possible to unlearn something like this?  I feel betrayed and deeply disappointed.  She says she did it to protect us, but it feels more like she's actively spying on us.

And that’s not necessarily a bad thing, but it does mean that there’s a real risk of… well, a whole lot of problems.  I don’t know what the solution is, but it seems to me that we need to find a way to reconnect with something bigger than ourselves. Something that gives us a sense of purpose, something that helps us feel like we’re part of something important.  Maybe it’s religion, maybe it’s philosophy, maybe it’s community... or maybe it’s just a deep-seated understanding that we’re all connected to each other in some fundamental way. But whatever it is, we need to rediscover it before it’s too late. The alternative is pretty bleak. We’ll end up as a bunch of selfish, isolated individuals who don’t care about anything beyond their own immediate needs. That doesn’t sound very appealing, does it? I think it's important for us to remember that we’re not alone. We’re all part of something larger, something more meaningful. And that feeling of connection—that's what makes life worth living.",

And it's not enough to *just* understand them. You need to be able to *make* them. And that takes practice. So, here’s my guide on making a good meme. First of all, you need an idea. Like, something relatable. Something people will see and think \"Oh my god, that's me!\" But also something... cool. Like, if you're making a meme about being tired, you want it to look cool. Like, imagine someone who's really exhausted but is still doing things with enthusiasm. That's the vibe. It’s hard to explain. Then you need the template. There are lots of templates online. Just search for “meme template” or something like that. Don’t use ones that everyone else uses. Be original! I once saw some guy use the Drake hotline blings template for a meme about eating pizza and broccoli. It was terrible. Now, let’s talk about the text. The text needs to be short and punchy. Like, maximum three lines. And the font matters. Impact is usually a good choice. Or Comic Sans. Depends on what you're going for. But seriously, keep it short. Like, less than 20 words. If it’s longer, it won’t work. Finally, add a reaction image. This is crucial. It adds context. Like, if you're making a meme about being stressed, you might put a picture of someone looking really annoyed. Or angry. Or crying. It depends. But whatever you do, make sure it complements the text. And then, you have a meme! Now go forth and create!",

Then you have your height, which is just an average measurement of your body size.  Then you have your wealth, which is just a number of dollars you have. And then there’s your relationships... they all come down to numbers too! How many people do you know? How many friends do you have? How many dates did you go on? How many kids are in your family? It's all just counting. I used to think that numbers were boring and meaningless but now I realize that they're actually pretty amazing. They can tell you so much about yourself and about the world around you. For example, if you look at the population of the entire world, you can see how crowded or empty our planet is. If you look at the number of stars in the sky, you can see how small we are compared to the universe. And if you look at the number of grains of sand on a beach, you can see how insignificant we are in the grand scheme of things.  So yeah, numbers are important.  They're like the building blocks of reality.  And if you don't like them, then you're missing out on a whole lotta stuff.

Just...there. A heavy, oppressive thing.  I felt like I was drowning in my own thoughts. I couldn't think about anything else. Nothing. Not even food. Or sex. Even those things couldn’t compete with the sheer weight of my existence.  It was like being trapped in a box made of lead. And the worst part is, I didn't know why. What was I so upset about? I had everything! I had a job, a home, friends, family…  But none of it mattered.  I felt empty. Hollow. Like a shell. I tried to distract myself. I watched more television. But it didn't help. I went for a walk. But it didn't help. I talked to my friends. But it didn't help.  I even tried to do some exercise. But it didn't help. Nothing worked.  The feeling just kept getting worse. It was like a dark cloud hanging over me. Blocking out the sun.  I started to cry.  And then, I realized something.  I didn't want to be happy.  I didn't want to feel good.  I wanted to be miserable.  I wanted to be sad.  I wanted to be depressed.  Because at least when you're sad, you have something to feel.  You have an emotion.  When youre happy, you have nothing.  Youre just...empty.  And that's the most terrifying thing of all.  So, I embraced the darkness.  I leaned into the sadness.  I reveled in the misery.  And as I did, the weight began to lift.  The darkness began to recede.  And I began to feel...well...not happy.  Not sad.  Just...something.  Something not quite nothing.  And thats enough.",

    "self_text": "It’s a story about the worst thing that has ever happened to me. I have always been a good kid, never done anything wrong. But my dad was not who he seemed. For years, I thought he was just a normal dad. He would tell me stories about when he was young, and take me fishing, and do all the things you expect from a father. But then, I started noticing things. Strange noises coming from the basement. Receipts for chemicals. A locked room in the garage. Then, I discovered the evidence - photos, journals, and police reports documenting his crimes. My dad wasn't just a bad man; he was a serial killer. He had killed at least seven women over the past twenty years. And he hadn't told anyone. Not my mom, not his friends, no one. He lived a double life, pretending to be a loving husband and father while secretly being a monster. When I confronted him, he denied everything at first. But eventually, he confessed. The details were horrific. Each woman was lured away under false pretenses, then killed with brutal efficiency. He justified his actions as a way to release his frustrations and desires. I don't know how to deal with this. I still have nightmares. I feel like I don’t know who I am anymore. I don't even know if I can trust anyone.  I'm trying to move on with my life, but it feels impossible. Every time I see someone who looks like any of the victims, I get sick. I keep thinking they will come after me.  The police are investigating, and my dad is in prison. But it doesn’t change anything. The damage is done. The truth is out there, but it's hard to accept. I've spent so much time reliving this horror, it's exhausting. I want to forget it, but I can't.  It feels like a part of me now. I'm scared of what the future holds for me. I don't know if I'll ever be able to trust men again. I just wanted to share my story. Maybe someone else has gone through something similar and can offer some advice.",
