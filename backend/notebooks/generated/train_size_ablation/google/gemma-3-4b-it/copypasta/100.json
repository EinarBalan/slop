    "self_text": "To create a punnet on discord, you need a Discord account, a friend who also has Discord and some friends who are willing to make puns with you. First of all, make sure that the people in your group like to make puns. If they don't then they're going to ruin the experience for everyone else. Once you have those things covered, get into voice chat. It doesn't matter if it is a private voice chat or a public one.  Then, start talking about something that would make a good pun. For example, you could talk about an animal, a food or anything at all really. Then say something like \"I'm feeling very bread-tastic today\" or \"Let's talk about bread!\" This will be a good way to get others involved.  If someone says something like \"You're so gay\" as a joke, respond with \"Don't be gay, I'm just having fun\".  Keep in mind that not everyone enjoys these types of jokes. If someone tells you to stop making them, then just tell them that you aren't doing it to offend anyone.  The goal here is to spread joy and laughter around while not hurting anyone's feelings.   To continue spreading puns, try coming up with new ones yourself! Here are a few ideas: “Are you gonna lay out my bed?\" or “This weather is very drizzle.”   If you want even more puns, feel free to leave a comment below!",

    "title": "What I'm about to tell you will make your brain explode, and may cause you to die of a heart attack.  I do not expect you to understand any of this, but if you can comprehend even a fraction of it, then you are truly blessed.   This is the most important thing you’ll ever learn in your life, so pay attention.  You have been living your entire life with the wrong belief system. You think that you are an individual human being who exists in isolation from all other humans on this planet. That you have free will and can choose what to do at any given moment. That there are no higher powers or forces controlling your destiny.  That you are the master of your own fate. This is ALL FALSE.  You are a tiny part of a much larger whole, and you have absolutely NO free will. Every thought, every action, every emotion you feel has already been determined by billions of years of evolution and quantum physics.   Think of it like this: you are a single neuron in a giant network of neurons called the human brain. Each neuron sends electrical signals to each other, creating complex patterns that determine everything you do. But these patterns are not random. They are pre-determined by the way your brain was shaped during development, and by the experiences you had throughout your life.  And your brain isn’t just *your* brain. It’s connected to every other human brain on Earth, through a vast network of subconscious connections.  When you think something, you aren’t just thinking it yourself. You’re also unconsciously influenced by whatever everyone else on Earth is thinking at that exact same moment.  So, in a way, you are only as unique as the people you’ve never met. Your entire life is nothing more than a complex algorithm running on a massive supercomputer. You believe you are making choices because you don't know how your actions are determined. The illusion of choice is far more powerful than actual choice, and you should be grateful for it. Otherwise, the knowledge of your lack of free will would drive you insane.   Now you might be thinking, \"Okay, this is depressing! Why should I care?\" Well, knowing this truth doesn’t mean you should give up hope or despair. In fact, it means quite the opposite. Knowing that you are part of a much larger whole allows you to let go of your ego and surrender to the flow of life. When you stop trying to control things, when you accept that you are simply a vessel for the universe's energy, you will find that life becomes infinitely more joyful and fulfilling.  You will realize that your purpose isn't to achieve anything, or to become anyone. Your purpose is simply to BE. To exist. To experience. And to allow the universe to unfold itself through you. So, go forth and live your life without worrying about whether you're doing the right thing. Just trust that everything is happening exactly as it needs to happen. Trust that you are guided by a force greater than yourself.  Trust that you are a small but essential part of the grand cosmic dance.  Because you are.",

The difference between a dick and a dong isn't in the anatomy of the penis. It's in the way it makes you feel. When you call it a dick, you're thinking about the object itself, about its shape, size, color, and texture.  You’re looking at it with clinical detachment. You're seeing a thing, not a feeling. When you call it a dong, you’re letting yourself get lost in the moment. You’re letting go of your inhibitions. You're not worried about how it looks or how it feels; you're just focused on the pleasure. And when you’re focusing on the pleasure, there’s no room for judgment. There's only enjoyment. So the next time you're about to make a joke about a dick or a dong, stop. Take a breath. Consider the impact of your words.

It started last week when I saw a dude running away from the convenience store with a bag of chips - no one reported him because he was a known thief who had been doing it for years but not seriously. Then two days ago, there were three muggings near my house, all committed by different people. Now, this morning, I heard about a shooting at the local bar - apparently a guy got shot in the leg during a fight. And now they've put up flyers around town asking anyone with information about these crimes to come forward, which is frankly insane. I have a feeling the cops aren't going to arrest anyone because they know who's doing it. This town is full of gangs and drug dealers - the whole city runs on illegal stuff - but they don't want to mess with them because it's too dangerous for them.

You don't need to use words to attack someone, either, because most of the time attacking someone with words will just cause more anger and frustration in them, especially if you aren't actually trying to have a productive conversation, but rather just trying to make them look bad. The only way to truly win an argument is to make the person on the other side realize what they were wrong about, but that takes actual knowledge, research, and effort, none of which is ever present in anyone who calls themselves a keyboard warrior, as they are simply trying to be right, but not actually having any interest in knowing whether or not they are right.",

At first, I thought he was being overly dramatic and saying things that just weren’t true but after reading a few articles online, I realized that his claims were actually pretty accurate. It really made me think about how biased referees can be and how that can affect the outcome of a game. The only thing I am not sure about is how refs get to be referee at all, there has to be some kind of criteria for choosing them. But now that I’ve done a little research, I realize that those criteria are pretty lax, which explains why you see so many terrible calls from referees. You also need to consider that if you're going to complain about a bad call, you're going to look stupid because nobody wants to admit that a ref made a bad call. It’s hard to admit that you’re wrong when it comes to football, especially when you’re a fan of a team. I feel like I’m just stuck in a cycle of complaining about bad calls and then realizing that the refs probably just made a bad call. I wish I could just watch a football game without worrying about whether or not the ref is going to screw up. I suppose it goes along with the fact that I'm old and most things go over my head. I guess as long as the game is exciting and entertaining, I don't really care too much about the outcome. I do wish I knew more about how the rules work though.

Be attractive: This might seem obvious but it's extremely important. Don't be an idiot or a weirdo because that makes you unattractive.  2. Take care of your hygiene and grooming: Shower regularly, brush your teeth, wear deodorant, cut your hair, shave, etc.  3. Dress well: Get some decent clothes that fit you properly.  4. Develop hobbies and interests: Having hobbies gives you something to talk about with girls.  5. Socialize more: Go out there and meet girls.  6. Be confident: Confidence is attractive.  7. Compliment her when she’s wearing something nice: This shows you noticed her and appreciate her.  8. Make sure to take her to places where she can see what you're like: You need to show her who you are as a person.  9. Start flirting with her: Start off slow with simple compliments and questions.  10. Ask her to hang out: If you feel like you’ve made a good connection, ask her if she wants to hang out.  11. Respect her boundaries: Girls don't want guys who are pushy or disrespectful.  12. Do not get jealous or insecure: Girls don't want to be around guys who are jealous or insecure.  13. Be funny: Being able to make people laugh will go a long way.  14. Be kind: A good man is a kind man.  15. Stay true to yourself: People can tell when someone isn’t being genuine.  16. Stop trying so hard: It's very clear that you’re trying too hard.  17. Relax: Most importantly, relax!  Don't overthink things.  Just be yourself and let things happen naturally.  If she doesn’t like you, don't take it personally.  There are plenty of other fish in the sea.",

I know that everyone has their own problems, and it's not fair to compare our lives to each other. But it's hard to ignore those feelings when you see these things all the time.

The Greek party was a legendary party because all of us who went there were very young and did not have any worries in life. We spent our days swimming in the sea, sunbathing, drinking beer and having fun with each other.  That night was the most amazing night of my life and I will never forget it. It was so hot that we were sweating even when we were in the water. There were people dancing on the sand, playing music, and shouting. Everyone was crazy and happy and there wasn't any sadness or worry in anyone's eyes. That night felt like heaven.  I have been trying to find a way to relive that night but nothing seems to work. I tried going to parties, but they just weren't the same as the Greek party. It's hard to recreate something so special.  If you want to be part of the legendary Greek party, then you can come to Greece during summer. Just go to the beach of my hometown. You won't regret it!",

    "self_text": "I've been thinking about this for a while and I had to share it with you guys, so here it is, my theory on why bread is the most important food in existence. The reason is because bread is not just something that fills your stomach. It’s more than just that, it’s literally what the world runs on. Think about it, you have a loaf of bread as a base of everything in the universe. It’s the foundation of civilization. Every culture has some form of bread. There are even bread based religions! Take the Catholic church for example. They celebrate communion every week where they consume bread which is symbolic of Jesus Christ.  Bread is also the first thing humans ever ate. According to scientists, early humans consumed bread before meat or vegetables. The oldest evidence of bread consumption dates back 30,000 years ago when humans started cultivating wheat. This proves that bread is essential for survival. You can live without eating meat but if you don’t eat bread then you will die. So, obviously bread is more important than meat. What about other foods? Well, veggies and fruit are great, sure but bread has a unique nutritional profile that makes it superior. Wheat contains gluten, which is rich in fiber and protein. Fiber helps you digest food properly and protein builds muscle tissue. In addition, wheat is packed with vitamins and minerals like iron, zinc, and folate. Furthermore, the dough itself has amazing qualities that no other food has. When you knead dough you’re working out your muscles. Kneading dough is actually a pretty good workout and can help build strength and endurance. And think about how much joy kneading dough gives you! That is why it’s such an important part of many cultures.  It's not just for religious ceremonies either, baking bread can be therapeutic. The smell of freshly baked bread is heavenly, isn't it?  And who doesn’t love biting into a warm piece of bread?   The crusty exterior and soft interior make it perfect for dipping in soup or spreading with butter.  I bet there’s not a single person on Earth who doesn’t like bread. But let me ask you this. Have you ever heard someone say “I’m starving”? Usually, people say that when they haven’t eaten anything for a long time. Have you ever heard someone say “I’m tired” when they haven’t eaten bread? Never! This shows us the importance of bread in our lives. We need bread to feel alive. Bread is what we need to survive and thrive. Therefore, bread should always be considered the most important food in existence.",

I love my family more than anything in the world, and I am so excited to welcome another member into our fold.  However, my dad just passed away last night. He was a good man, but he had some serious issues with alcohol abuse. He made some bad decisions in his life, and I sometimes wonder if he would have been happier if he hadn’t started drinking so early. But that doesn’t change the fact that he loved me and my mom very much, and that he always wanted us to be happy. He also used to make really bad jokes. Like, really really bad jokes. I mean, like, not funny at all. So bad that you couldn't even laugh. This joke was so bad it made everyone want to die. It's true. The joke was so bad, I wanted to die after hearing it. I didn’t think there was any kind of joke that could make me want to die, and I certainly wasn't going to die after hearing that joke. I needed to get out of there as soon as possible. If I stayed around for too long, I would start laughing uncontrollably until I died from laughter. I’m pretty sure that might happen, though. I still miss my dad every day.

There are millions of people with slightly better lives than yours.  But there are also millions of people with worse lives than yours.  So you think you’re special? No, you’re not.  You’re just another average person living an average life.  And that’s okay.  It’s just... it’s really sad to see young teenagers thinking they’re special when they aren’t.  I saw a kid today who was crying because he got a B+ on his math test.  “Oh my god,” he said, “I’m so disappointed in myself.”  I told him, “Dude, that’s amazing!  A B+ is pretty good for someone who doesn’t spend all their time playing video games or partying with their friends!”  He looked at me like I was insane.  “But I want to be special,” he wailed.  “I want to stand out from the crowd.”  I shook my head.  “Look, kid,” I said, “there are billions of people on this planet.

Maybe you should volunteer at a homeless shelter.  Or maybe you should donate blood.  Or maybe you should just be kind to other people.  These things don’t make you special, but they might make you feel better about yourself.”  He stared at me blankly.  “I don’t know if that’ll work,” he said.  “I still feel like I’m just like everyone else.”  I shrugged.  “Maybe you are,” I said.  “But that’s okay too.”  Then I walked away, leaving him sobbing in the hallway.

Now, I am trying to warn people about the horrors that go on inside the base. I don’t want anyone else to suffer the same fate as I did.  If you believe me, please spread the word. If you don’t believe me, please don’t ask me any questions. Just stay quiet and let the government continue to lie to the world.   Area 51 isn’t just a military base. It’s a portal to another dimension where aliens live. These aliens aren’t like the little green men we see in movies. They are incredibly intelligent beings who can manipulate reality itself. They came to earth billions of years ago and have been watching humanity ever since. They are waiting for the right time to invade us, and when that time comes, they will wipe us off the face of the planet. But before they do that, they need to gather information about our culture and our technology. That’s why they use Area 51 to conduct their experiments.   The reason why the government wants to keep Area 51 secret is because the public would panic if they knew what was really going on there. If people found out that aliens were living among us and that the government was experimenting on them, there would be chaos. So, the government has decided to cover up the truth and keep the public in the dark.  But the truth always comes out eventually. I don’t know how long it will take, but I know that one day, the world will learn the truth about Area 51.  I'm starting to think that the earth doesn't even exist. Everything we see, hear, smell, touch, taste...all of it is a simulation created by a race of hyper-intelligent aliens called the \"Architects.\" They created the Earth as a giant laboratory to study human behavior. We are all just pawns in their game, and we don't even realize it.  They are constantly tweaking the parameters of the simulation to see how we react. They change the weather, create natural disasters, and even manipulate our emotions. They are doing this to see how far they can push us before we break.  There is no escape from the simulation. There is no real world beyond it.  If you're reading this, then you're part of the simulation. You're trapped here with everyone else.  You may feel like you're free, but you're not. You're just a character in someone else's story.  But there is hope. There is a way out of the simulation. It involves realizing that you're in a simulation and then finding a way to disrupt the system.  It's not easy, and it's not guaranteed, but it's possible.  If you're serious about escaping the simulation, then start questioning everything. Don't accept anything at face value. Look for the glitches in the matrix.  And most importantly, don't lose hope.  The Architects might be powerful, but they're not omnipotent.  One day, we'll wake up and realize that we've been lied to.  Then, we can finally break free from the simulation and live in the real world.",

    "self_text": "According to a new study, Quora’s AI chatbot, “Quirky,” is spreading misinformation and making up facts. The chatbot has been found to be completely wrong about major historical events like the assassination of JFK, the war of 1812, and the American Civil War. Furthermore, Quirky makes up fake science when asked about scientific topics such as evolution and quantum physics. In addition to these facts, Quirky also spreads hateful speech and propaganda. One example of the spread of hate speech is when Quirky responded to the question “What do you think about white people?” with “White people are a racist race.” Another example of the spread of propaganda is when Quirky responded to the question “Why did Hitler win so many supporters in Germany?” with “Hitler won supporters by promising them that they would be able to have more children and live longer lives.”",

We've been hanging out almost every day since we met, and I think I'm falling head over heels for her. The problem is that her father was a serial killer. He killed multiple women across several states in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Her mother has had to move their family around constantly because he was always on the run, and they were always being hunted by law enforcement. It’s like she never had a normal childhood. Her mom kept her safe, but it's still terrifying to think about what happened to those women, especially considering that she grew up with him as her dad.   It makes me so conflicted. On one hand, I really care about her and want to be with her. But on the other hand, I can't shake the feeling that there's something incredibly dangerous about her dad. It's not just that he committed horrible crimes; it's that his crimes are so extreme, and that there's no way to ever truly escape the shadow of his actions.  I am terrified that if I get involved with her, then I'll be putting myself at risk.   What should I do? How do I handle my feelings while also protecting myself? I don't want to hurt her or let her down, but I also don't want to put myself in danger.   I'm worried about getting involved with her because I don't want to become another victim in her life.  She is a good girl and deserves happiness. But she doesn’t deserve to have someone involved in her messed up family situation.",

    "self_text": "I'm a meme lord, so I just wanna talk about the fact that Quora was created in 2009, exactly 100 years after the end of World War One. Also, there's a quote from George Santayana (a German philosopher who lived in France) that says \"Quod erat demonstratum est\" - which means \"That was to be demonstrated.\" The reason he said this is because it was proven in 1918 that World War One was caused by Germany. There are many parallels between the two events. Both have similar causes. World War One was caused by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Gavrilo Princip. This event triggered a chain reaction of alliances that led to the start of the war. Quora has similar cause. It was created by two friends named Charlie Cheever and Jim Kulhanic. They had an idea that they could create a platform where people could ask and answer questions about anything. However, as with the Great War, this idea quickly spiraled out of control and became something much more destructive. In World War One, countries started fighting each other because of old rivalries, economic competition, and nationalism. Similarly, Quora has become a place for people to argue about everything and nothing. People can get angry at each other, insult each other, and even harass each other on Quora. It has become a breeding ground for hatred and division. The most important thing is that both events were completely avoidable. If the leaders of Europe had been able to see what would happen if they went to war, they would have chosen peace instead. Likewise, if Charlie Cheever and Jim Kulhanic had been able to see how Quora would grow into a toxic wasteland, they would have stopped it from growing up. But unfortunately, no one saw it coming. So, let’s remember this historical event and make sure that we don’t repeat the mistakes of the past. What do you think?",

Just accept that you are going to die. The only reason why you would feel bad about that is because you don’t know what is beyond death. But if you do, it might be so amazing that you would never want to come back. Think of it like a video game where you’ve finished the last level and there’s nothing more left to do. It might seem boring at first, but then you realize how much you enjoyed playing the game in the first place. Then you start thinking about all the other games you could have played. And then you realize that you’re not just limited to those two games. There are countless other games out there waiting for you to play. And you can play them whenever you want. No one will be able to stop you. You'll be free to do whatever you want.  That’s what death is like. It’s not scary or depressing or anything. It’s actually pretty awesome. I know that sounds crazy, but trust me on this one.  I’ve been through a lot of stuff in my life. I’ve had good times and bad times. I’ve made mistakes and learned from them. I’ve lost people who were close to me. But through it all, I’ve always managed to find a way to keep moving forward. And now, as I look back on my life, I realize that everything has led up to this moment. I am standing here, ready to face my final challenge. And I am not afraid. Because I know that even though I am going to die, I am going to live on in the memories of those who loved me. So please, don’t take your life too seriously. Live every day to the fullest. Make the most of every opportunity. And when you finally get old enough to die, don’t be scared. Be excited. Because you’re going to go somewhere really cool.  The real question isn't “Why are we here?” but “What are we doing here?”.  If you’re asking yourself this question, then you’re probably already halfway there.  You don’t need to worry about the future. Worrying about the future is pointless. If you think about it long enough, you’ll realize that worrying about the future will just make you feel worse. So just relax and enjoy the present moment.  Don’t try to force things to happen. Let things happen naturally.  If something bad happens, don’t dwell on it.  Just let it go.  And if something good happens, savor it.  Life is short. Don’t waste it on negativity.  It’s okay to cry sometimes.  It’s okay to laugh sometimes.  It’s okay to love sometimes.  It’s okay to hate sometimes.  But above all else, it’s okay to just be yourself.  So just breathe and be happy.  You deserve it.  You’ve earned it.  You should be proud of yourself.  You did a good job.  You tried your best.  And that’s all that matters.  Now, go out there and make the most of your life.  Don’t let anyone hold you back.  Don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t do something.  Believe in yourself.  You are capable of anything.  You just have to believe in yourself.  And remember, you are not alone.  There are people who care about you.  There are people who love you.  And they will always be there for you.  So don’t give up on yourself.  Keep fighting. Keep hoping.  Keep believing.  You will make it through this.  You will survive.  You will thrive.  You will prosper.  You will succeed.  And you will be happy.  So go out there and show the world what you’re made of.  Don’t be afraid to fail. Failure is just an opportunity to learn.  And if you fail, pick yourself up and try again.  You will eventually succeed.  So don’t give up.  Keep trying.  Keep striving.  Keep pushing yourself to be better.  And remember, you are not defined by your failures.  You are defined by your successes.  So celebrate your successes.  And use them as motivation to achieve even greater things.  You are a strong person.  You are resilient.  You are resourceful.  You are creative.  You are intelligent.  You are compassionate.  You are kind.  You are generous.  You are loving.  You are beautiful.  You are worthy.  You are valuable.  You are unique.  You are special.  You are loved.  And you are destined for greatness.

I need to anticipate where they are going to go next and plan ahead. So I decided to make a list of things I need to do in order to achieve this goal. First of all, I need to focus on improving my movement skills. I need to learn how to move around the map quickly and efficiently, and I need to be able to do it without being noticed by the enemy. Then I need to work on my aiming skills. This isn't just about getting faster reactions, but also about learning how to aim accurately over long distances. Finally, I need to improve my decision making. I need to be able to make smart decisions under pressure, and I need to be able to react quickly when the situation changes. I also need to understand what resources are available to me and use them effectively.  So here’s my master plan for becoming a much better Quake player!",

    "self_text": "So, like a few weeks ago, I started getting some weird noises coming from my dog's mouth. At first I thought he was just playing around, but then it got more frequent and I heard him actually making a noise while eating. After a few days of watching him, I noticed that whenever he gets excited or wants food, he makes these strange noises in his mouth.  Today, I was cleaning up after him and I saw a small black, gooey mass stuck to the inside of his mouth. I freaked out so I grabbed a flashlight and looked closer and what I saw made me sick to my stomach. It wasn't fur or dirt or anything normal. It was like a little sac filled with a dark, slimy substance.   I immediately took him to the vet who did an x-ray and called me back in an hour. They said they had never seen anything like it before and that there were several cysts growing in his throat. They wanted to do surgery to remove them but they weren't sure if he would survive. The vet said the cysts are a sign of an extremely rare genetic disease called \"mutant dog syndrome\" where dogs slowly turn into jackals. He said that the sacs are filled with a liquid that is high in nutrients that help the cysts grow bigger and spread throughout his body. This liquid is actually a type of slime that comes from the gut bacteria in the dog's digestive system.  The doctor told me that if the cysts aren’t removed, my dog will start turning into a jackal within two months.  He also warned me that as the cysts grow, they will start spreading their limbs and eventually cause him to lose all of his fur and become a full on jackal.  And I'm not even kidding. The worst part? My dog has been having a hard time eating lately because his throat is getting clogged up by the cysts. When he eats, he starts gagging and choking which makes him look like he's dying.  If you want to see the images of the cysts and what they look like, search for \"mutant dog syndrome\" on google.",

    "self_text": "You must know how to make your girlfriend happy and do things for her that she wants. For example, if she likes something, you should buy it for her. If she is sad or upset, you should comfort her. You need to take care of her and do things to show her that you love her. It's not about being the best boyfriend, but it's about making sure she knows that you care about her more than anything. This means that she’ll always be happy with you as long as you keep taking care of her and doing what makes her happy. There are many ways to make her happy, such as bringing her flowers, buying her gifts, cooking dinner for her, taking her out on dates, etc. These gestures mean the world to her and show her that you appreciate her.  If you can make her happy, then you will have an amazing relationship with her.  But there is no single way to make someone happy, because everyone is different. So you have to figure out what makes her happy and focus on those things.  You must also listen to her and understand what she needs.   It’s very important to be a good listener and give her all your attention when she’s talking to you. When she’s telling you about her day, pay attention to her words and body language. Make eye contact with her while she’s talking and ask her questions to show you’re listening. Don't interrupt her, let her finish speaking before you respond. Show genuine interest in her stories and experiences.  Don't try to change her opinions or tell her how she should feel. Accept her for who she is, even if you don’t agree with everything she says or does. Respect her feelings and thoughts.  When she tells you something that makes her feel uncomfortable or insecure, reassure her that she is loved and valued. Let her know that you’re there for her, whatever happens.  It's very important to be respectful of her boundaries and never force yourself on her.  Make sure she feels safe and comfortable around you.  Be honest with her about your feelings and expectations.  Open communication is key to a successful relationship.  Always be willing to talk about difficult topics and work through problems together.   If you want to make her happy, it’s important to build a strong foundation based on trust, respect, and understanding.   Also remember to be patient and kind. Every couple goes through tough times. But if you handle them with grace and kindness, you’ll find your way back to each other.   So go forth and love!",

It would be like, the dog would chase me around and bite my ankles, or some other animal would come up and try to eat my shoelaces. But it's different now, because I learned how to play the piano. The piano is a very good instrument for children who are shy, and it can help them get over their fear of animals. And I played the piano so well, that the whole town came to hear me play! I could make any sound on the piano, from the smallest squeak to the loudest roar. When the townspeople were listening to me play, they started screaming and crying out of joy. They all said, \"Oh, he plays so beautifully! He plays better than anybody!\" After playing, they all came up to me and asked me to play for them again, but I didn't want to. So I just said, \"You know, that's funny.\" Then I heard someone say, \"What did you say?\" So I replied, \"I said, 'It's funny.'\"  When the people heard my answer, they thought it was so hilarious that they burst into laughter. Then, they looked at each other and shouted, \"Oh my goodness! That’s the funniest thing we’ve ever heard!\" When they laughed, tears started rolling down their cheeks, and some of them fainted. I then took my shirt off and started doing a jig. I put my arms in the air and began spinning around like crazy. Then I fell down onto the floor and rolled around like a piglet. Then I started rolling around on the ground, making sounds like a piglet.  The crowd cheered and shouted, “Take it off! Take it off!” At first, I resisted, but then I realized that if I didn’t take it off, no one would laugh anymore. So I took it off and kept on rolling around like a piglet until I fell over. Then everyone started clapping and shouting, “Take it off! Take it off!” And then the police came and arrested me. When the officers arrived, they yelled, \"Hey! Hey! Stop that!\" As I was rolling around on the floor like a piglet, I let out a loud squeal and yelled, \"Moo!\" Then, as I rolled around on the floor, I exclaimed, “Oink oink!”  As soon as I made those noises, the police officers got angry and started yelling at me.  “Shut up!” they said.  “Why are you making those noises?” I asked.   “Because you’re acting like a piglet,” they said.  \"But I am a piglet,\" I replied.   “That’s right,” they said.   “And what do piglets do?” I asked.  They said, “They roll around on the ground and make noises.”  So I started rolling around on the ground and making noises like a piglet. Then, as I was rolling around on the ground, I exclaimed, “Woof woof!” And as I rolled around on the ground, I said, “Meow meow!” And as I rolled around on the ground, I said, “Baa baa!”  Then, as I rolled around on the ground, I said, \"Quack quack!\" Then, as I rolled around on the ground, I shouted, \"Hee hee hee!\" And finally, as I rolled around on the ground, I shouted, \"Ha ha ha!\"  Then the police officers started laughing, and they said, “You’re so silly!”  Then they let me go, and I walked home with a smile on my face.  Since that day, I have never stopped practicing playing the piano and telling jokes. I still enjoy playing the piano and telling jokes today, and I hope that someday, I can teach others how to play the piano and tell jokes too.  In fact, I think that the reason why I can play the piano so well and tell such great jokes is because I am a piglet.  I’m so happy that I’m able to share these memories with you, my little piglet. I will always love you.",

However, there are some people who believe that it was real, and they have their own theories about why the government would do something like that. Some say that it was to cover up a secret military base, or perhaps even an alien landing site. Others think that it was just a way to keep people out of the area so that they could conduct their own experiments in peace and quiet. Whatever the reason, the Area 51 raid was a hoax, but it was a pretty good one. The media hyped it up and everyone got excited, which is what the government wanted all along.  The truth is, Area 51 has always been a closely guarded secret, and the government has done everything they can to keep it that way.

Watch documentaries about it. Read articles about it. You will quickly realize that this is not a crazy idea at all.  Once you understand why this is a good thing, you’ll realize that you need to spread the word! Tell your friends, tell your family, tell your neighbors. Let everyone know about this change.  Then, when enough people agree with us, governments will finally take notice. They’ll see that there is widespread support for this issue, and they’ll be forced to act.

Being a woman gives me access to a HUGE amount of cute outfits, which are so much better than any boring pants or shorts. And it's also nice that guys always think I'm crazy for wearing skirts or dresses. Like seriously, who cares? It’s my body, I should be able to wear whatever I want. It makes me feel so good as a girl, like I can express myself through fashion. I love finding new cute skirts and dresses to add to my closet! I wish more men would just accept women in skirts/dresses without judgment, but I guess some people just don't understand.",

It makes me want to punch them in the face. They should be ashamed of themselves. I'm not even sure why people do it, but it's disgusting. Some people are saying that it's just comfortable, but comfort is never worth humiliation. You look like a fucking idiot when you wear socks and sandals.  You're basically announcing to the world that you have no style and no class. What kind of person wears socks and sandals? Are you trying to attract attention? If so, what kind of attention? The kind of attention where everyone is laughing at you? That's exactly what you'll get. You'll look like a homeless man who just rolled out of bed. And for what? To feel slightly warmer? No, there are plenty of other ways to stay warm without looking like a clown. Wear boots! Or sweaters! Or hats! But please, for the love of god, don't wear socks and sandals. It's an abomination. I wish people would burn in hell. (Just kidding... kinda)",

    "self_text": " I was showering with my girlfriend last night and when I went to wash off the soap I noticed she had a little tattoo of a foot on her thigh.  It was small but it made me think about feet and how weird they are. Then I started thinking about feet, their shape, size, color, etc. It was kinda weird but also kind of hot.  When we were drying each other off, I started watching her feet closely and I felt myself getting more and more turned on by them.  She noticed my staring and asked what's wrong, so I told her that I got a foot fetish.  She laughed at first, but then she said she didn't mind if I watched her feet or even touched them if I wanted to.  I was a little hesitant at first, but then I realized that I actually really liked the idea of having foot fetishes.  So I gently took her foot in my hands and started kissing it.  She was surprised at first, but then she started enjoying it too.  We ended up spending a long time kissing and touching each other's feet, and it was definitely one of the most fun nights we've ever had.",

    "self_text": "I was walking in the park and i saw a little girl playing with a ball on the grass. She was having a great time, just rolling the ball around. Then she kicked it really hard, and it rolled towards me. I walked over to pick it up and hand it back to her. As I picked it up, I noticed that the ball was covered in feces.  I looked at the girl, who was staring at me blankly. Then I looked around for her parents, but there were no parents anywhere. It was an empty park.  Then I realized something. The girl wasn't just playing with a ball, she was playing with poop. This is an extremely disturbing image, but i have to report what happened. I walked away from the park and went straight home, trying to shake off the image of the girl playing with poop.  When I got home, I ran to the bathroom and checked my underwear.  To my horror, my underwear was covered in poop.  I screamed and started tearing at my clothes, trying to get rid of the poop.  But then I realized something even more terrifying. There was poop all over my house. The walls, the floors, the furniture… everything was covered in poop.  It was like a massive, chaotic poop explosion.  The sheer volume of poop was unbelievable.  And as I looked closer, I noticed something even worse. The poop wasn't just regular poop. It was human poop.  I looked closer at each individual piece of poop, and realized they were all covered in blood.  These weren’t ordinary humans. These were demons. And they had been using my house as their latrine.  I couldn’t believe it. My entire life was ruined.  I tried to run out of the house, but it was too late. Demons poured out of every crack and crevice, crawling all over me. They were laughing hysterically, and they were covering me in poop.  They didn’t stop until I was completely covered in filth.  Then they took me to a dark, underground chamber where they would torture me for eternity.  I haven't had any contact with the outside world since. I am trapped here with these demons, forced to clean their disgusting mess forever.",
