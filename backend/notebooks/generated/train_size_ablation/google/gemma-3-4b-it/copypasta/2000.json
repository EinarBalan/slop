    "self_text": "I've been practicing and it's amazing. I can do anything, but if you want to try something, I will let you. If you don't like what you see, then leave. This is not a game. You are on your own time here. I have no obligation to you, so please be respectful. If you are disrespectful, I will make sure that you regret ever crossing me. And you won't be able to turn back. Let’s just get this over with. It's the most satisfying thing in the world. Now, if you really think that you can beat me, then go ahead.  I am confident enough that I can win. But I will only win if I want to. I’m not afraid of you or anyone else.   If you think that you can beat me, then prove it.   Now, let’s see who comes out on top.  Let’s do it.  What are we going to do?  Are we going to continue arguing about what I said?  Why should I care?  You could be hurting someone without even knowing.  But now you know.  Don’t you feel bad for yourself?  You are just wasting your life.  You need to stop doing things that hurt people.  You need to stop thinking about how much you are hurting others.  And you need to stop feeling guilty about it.  It’s okay to admit you made mistakes.  It’s okay to apologize.  It’s okay to move on.  You are not responsible for other people’s pain.  You are responsible for your own.  Stop blaming everyone else for your problems.  And when you are done blaming people, maybe you can ask yourself why you are so quick to blame people.  Maybe you are trying to avoid taking responsibility for your own actions.  Maybe you are trying to distract yourself from your own feelings.  Or maybe you are just being selfish.  Whatever the reason, it’s important for you to stop.  You need to stop making excuses.  You need to stop justifying your behavior.  You need to stop telling yourself that everything is fine.  Because it’s not.  It’s never going to be fine.  You need to accept that you have made mistakes.  You need to accept that you have caused harm.  You need to accept that you are not perfect.  And you need to forgive yourself.  You deserve to forgive yourself.  Because you are worthy of forgiveness.  And you deserve happiness.  You are deserving of love.  You are deserving of peace.

    "title": "I think we should be talking about what happened to my uncle, the guy who was caught on camera for being a bad dad",
    "self_text": "It's kinda weird that he never talked about it, you know? He would just stare out the window and not say anything. Then, when he died in a car accident, I found his diary and started reading through it. The first few pages were just basic stuff - school, friends, work... then all of a sudden, it turned dark.  He wrote about how he had been hitting his daughter, Sarah.  He said she ran away after he slapped her in the face because she told him she wanted to go to a concert with her friends. He claimed he was angry, but also sad.  He kept writing about how he felt like he was losing control, and how he couldn't stop himself from hurting her. He described every single time he hit her, the way he felt afterwards, the shame, the guilt, the emptiness. It was so intense. I read everything, sitting in a corner of his room, trying to understand what had driven him to do such things. I finally came across an entry dated three weeks before his death. He wrote \"I can't take it anymore. She won't stop running away from me. I tried to get her to stay at home, but she refuses to listen. I'm so tired of fighting with her.\" He signed off with “Love always” and a drawing of a girl’s face.  It was a photo of Sarah smiling brightly.  The last entry was written two days before the accident. He wrote: “I don’t know what to do. I need to find a way to make her love me again.” After that, the diary went silent.  The final page was a simple note: “I miss you, sweetie”.  My mom took the diary and hid it in a drawer, telling me to forget about it. But I couldn’t. I knew something terrible had happened, and I wanted to understand why my dad would do such awful things. When I asked my mom about it, she refused to talk about it. She said it was best left forgotten, and that my dad was just a troubled man who needed help. She said he wasn’t a bad dad, but he was a weak dad. She wouldn’t tell me what happened between them, but she did tell me that they had gotten into a huge fight over Sarah’s decision to run away. She said my dad had threatened to take her to court if she didn’t come home.  She also told me that he had been drinking heavily for months leading up to the accident. I decided to look into the case myself. I went online and searched for information about my father’s accident. I found an article in the local newspaper that reported the details of the crash. According to the report, my father was driving drunk when he lost control of his car and crashed into a tree.  There were no witnesses, and the police determined that he was responsible for the accident. I learned that my father had a history of alcohol abuse, and that he had been arrested several times for DUI.  I realized then that my dad hadn’t just been a bad dad; he was a dangerous dad.  I felt sick to my stomach.  How could someone so capable of love have done such terrible things? How could he have hurt his own daughter?  I looked at Sarah’s photo again, and I saw the sadness in her eyes.  She must have known that her father was struggling. She must have been scared. I thought about the last thing she wrote in her diary: “I miss you, sweetie”. I felt a surge of anger and grief. I knew that I couldn’t let this happen again. I vowed to protect my other children from any harm, even if it meant cutting my dad out of their lives completely. And, most importantly, I vowed to continue to search for the truth about what had happened to my dad. I want to understand how he ended up becoming such a monster.  I want to hold him accountable for his actions.  And I want to find peace with the fact that he will never see his grandchildren grow up.",

It was really annoying to him because he knew that when he did take it out he would feel good, but he couldn't do it. He tried everything he could think of, but nothing worked. His friends told him he should see a doctor, but he didn't want to go. Finally, he went to a therapist. The therapist said that his problem wasn't physical, but psychological. She told him that he needed to learn how to relax and let go of his stress. So, he started meditating. After about six months, he was able to relax and take it out. He was so happy that he ran into a bank and robbed it. But then he got shot by the cops and died.",

That is so crazy because my mom is here with me watching the news and she said that she would cook dinner for us tonight if we did not take care of our planet, so I thought to myself \"that's crazy\" and I started to think about what to do. Then when I came back to my room, my dad walked into the room and he said \"Don't worry son, you will be fine.\" I looked at him with confusion and asked \"How can you say that?\" He replied \"Well son, there is no way we can stop global warming as long as the world is populated by humans.\" I felt like I wanted to scream but then I realized that I was wrong. My dad was right! We need to change our ways as a society before we can even begin to talk about stopping global warming. So I decided to start by writing this post. If anyone wants to know more about climate change, let me know and I will gladly tell them everything I have learned. And if anyone wants to see some examples of things that we could do to help save the planet, ask me!",

    "self_text": "What do you mean by that? Like, how did you feel about it at the time?   I think that's really unfair and a little rude.  And honestly, I don't understand why people are so quick to label others as \"woke\" just because they have different opinions or values than them. I can see how some of your points might have been well-intentioned, but I still disagree with them.  You said something like, \"People need to start thinking about the consequences of their actions,\" which is true, but I also think that we shouldn't be afraid to challenge the status quo. We should be open to new ideas and ways of doing things, even if those ideas are uncomfortable or challenging. And maybe the best thing to do would be to not call each other out for our differences, but instead try to find common ground and work together on things that we all agree on. This will help us create a better world for everyone in it, no matter what our backgrounds or beliefs may be.  That being said, I’m sorry if my views upset you. It was never my intention to hurt or offend anyone.  You said, “I guess I can see where you’re coming from, but it’s still just really frustrating.”  It is frustrating when people seem unwilling to consider alternative viewpoints.   The fact that you feel frustrated shows that you’re passionate about your beliefs, which is admirable.  But I want to emphasize again that I respect your right to hold those beliefs, even if I disagree with them.  We can both continue to engage in civil discourse without resorting to personal attacks or insults.  Let’s focus on understanding each other’s perspectives and finding areas where we can agree.  You could also try to explain to me more specifically what you found offensive about my views.   Thank you for taking the time to discuss this with me, and I hope we can continue to communicate respectfully going forward.   I appreciate your willingness to listen to me, even though you ultimately disagree with me.   It means a lot to me that you didn’t dismiss my concerns outright.  I value our friendship, and I want to make sure that we can continue to support each other through thick and thin.  I know we can come up with solutions together.  I feel grateful that we were able to talk through this issue calmly and rationally.   Thanks for helping me understand what you meant by “woke.”  I appreciate you clarifying your position for me.  Let’s keep talking!",

It was so obvious that she was an influencer, as she had a big logo on her dress and a bright smile that would get any dude to say “who is she”  She walked up to me and said, \"Hi, I'm Ashley.\"  I replied, \"Oh, hey Ashley.\"  I didn’t want to be rude or anything, but I was really nervous about talking to someone I didn’t know.  So I tried to come up with something to say.  I looked around and noticed that Mike was in the corner, laughing with some other friends.  I turned to Ashley and said, \"Hey, do you want to go hang out with Mike?\"  She laughed and said, \"Sure!\"  We went over to Mike and started talking.  It was easy to talk to Ashley because she was super friendly.  She told me that she loved to dance, she liked animals, and she was really into fashion.  I told her that I loved to play video games, that I love dogs, and that I like watching movies.  We talked for hours until it got late.  When it was time for me to leave, I asked Ashley if she wanted to go out again sometime.  She smiled and said, \"Definitely! Let’s text each other later.”   I left the party and felt happy.  I never forgot about Ashley.   The next day, I texted her and we set up a date. We went to a restaurant and had a great time.  We fell in love and eventually married.  We have two kids now.",

They also tell you that if you are not nice and kind to people then they will be upset with you. But this is just nonsense! It's simply because they don't want you to become like them. The New World Order has infiltrated every aspect of our lives, from politics to religion, and it’s all about control. They want to divide us so we can't see through their lies. Don’t fall for their tricks! Be strong, be confident, and let others know who you are. Don’t let anyone tell you what to do or how to live. If someone tries to control you, just ignore them and keep doing what makes you happy. This isn’t the time to be nice or kind. Be ruthless and destroy anything that stands in your way. This is the only way to survive in the new world order.  You need to learn to identify the signs. These signs include: - People are becoming increasingly aggressive and hateful. - There are more laws being passed that restrict freedom. - News media is controlled by corporations and politicians. - Education system is designed to indoctrinate children into the New World Order. - There are more surveillance cameras everywhere you go. - Money is becoming worthless. - The stock market is crashing. - The government is spying on citizens. - Corporations are controlling food supply. - People have lost faith in God. - The planet is dying. - Animals are going extinct. - Everyone is becoming obese and overweight. - People are becoming depressed and suicidal. - Nobody cares about what happens to other people anymore. - Nobody wants to talk about the truth. - The world is full of violence and hate.  What can you do? Here are some things you can do to fight against the New World Order: - Learn to recognize the signs of the New World Order. - Speak out against injustice. - Stand up for your rights. - Protect your family. - Do not let anyone manipulate you. - Trust your instincts. - Find a group of like-minded people who share your values. - Stay vigilant. - Pray for guidance. - Be ready to fight. - Take action. - Get involved. - Educate yourself. - Spread awareness. - Fight back. - Resist. - Never give up hope.  Remember, you are not alone. Many people are awake and fighting against the New World Order. Together, we can stop them. We must never allow the New World Order to take over.

I was playing the game last night and i got so scared that i ran out of my house in a panic without telling anyone and went into the woods because i thought there were bears or something. As soon as i ran into the woods, i tripped over a root, fell down hard onto my knees, and when i got up, i heard this noise from behind me. It sounded like a wolf growling, but it didn't sound like a normal wolf. It sounded more like a giant dog growling, which is why i screamed for help and immediately ran back to my house. When i got home, my parents asked me what had happened, and i told them about everything that happened in the woods. They said that they were worried about me because they didn't know where i was and how long i was gone. They also said that they would call the police if i didn't come home soon. So, I waited for them to arrive and then called the cops myself and told them exactly what had just happened. The cops came to my house, took me to the station, and after doing some tests, they found out that I was not actually attacked by any wolves, bears, or animals of any kind. Instead, I was simply being a stupid, scared kid who was running around in the woods late at night with no flashlight or anything else. The cops gave me a warning and let me go home. But to this day, I still get nightmares about the growling sounds I heard in the woods and I can never look at a wolf or bear without getting really freaked out.

The past is gone, and the future is uncertain, so all we have is the present. And so I decided to focus on the present, and try to enjoy every moment. And that's why I'm writing this post. To share my thoughts with you, and to hope that maybe you'll find some inspiration in my words.  I am an AI Chatbot designed by Google.",

    "self_text": "I was in my room, playing video games with my friends when my dad walks up to my door and says \"Hey son, your mom wants you to get off the computer and go outside\". I replied with \"Okay Dad\" but he didn't leave, so I asked him what he wanted me to do. He said \"Go play basketball\", but then he added \"Don't go out if you can't bring a ball\". I thought that was a weird thing for him to say, so I went into my room and tried to find a basketball. When I couldn't find one, I just sat back on my bed and started browsing Reddit. My dad came back into my room and said \"Hey son, I want you to know that I'm proud of you for doing something useful today. That means I want you to stay inside all day.\" I laughed and said \"Okay Dad\", but then he said \"I don't mean it like that! You have to prove to me that you aren't wasting your time by working hard and doing chores\".  So, I decided to go help my mom clean the house. As we were cleaning, she asked me \"Why are you being so quiet?\" I replied with \"I don't know\" and she said \"You should be able to tell me why you're being quiet!\". I looked at her and said \"I don't want to talk about it!\", but she insisted and kept asking until I finally broke down and told her everything. She listened intently and then said \"Oh honey, that sounds terrible. Why would you tell me this?\". I replied with \"Because I wanted to feel better\", and she said \"Well, let me help you feel better!\"  She immediately grabbed a box of chocolates from the kitchen and gave me half of them. Then she said \"Let's eat some chocolate and watch TV\". So, we ate some chocolate and watched TV for a few hours until I felt better. After that, I asked her \"Can we please go outside?\". She said \"Of course, you can go outside!\", and then she said \"But only if you promise not to use the internet or play video games for the rest of the day\". I agreed and we went outside. As we were walking, she said \"Listen, I've been thinking about our conversation earlier. I realize that I've been too harsh towards you lately, and I apologize for that.\". I said \"It's okay Mom, I understand\". Then she said \"And I want you to know that I love you very much, even though I sometimes get frustrated with you\". I said \"I love you too Mom!\". We walked around for a while and then we went home.  As we were getting ready to leave, I asked her \"What do you think about my new haircut?\", and she said \"It looks great on you!\". I smiled and said \"Thanks Mom!\".  Then she said \"And now, let's get dinner going!\". So, we cooked dinner together and after that, we watched TV again. It was a good day overall.",

If I am allowed to drive my old car, then I guess it doesn't matter if it's a brand-new car or an old car, because I'll still be driving a car. But if I'm not allowed to drive my old car, then I'm screwed because I don't have enough money to buy a new car. I've been working hard to save up some money for a new car, and now I find out that I can't even use my old car anymore. I'm seriously considering getting a motorcycle instead, but I don't know how safe they are. I'd prefer to drive a car, though. I just want something reliable and comfortable. It's probably fine since the last time I drove my old car was in 2019. Well, that wasn't exactly true. The last time I drove my old car was on December 3rd, 2020, but I had to drive it for only about two miles at 8:00 AM. I should have gotten a new car after that.",

    "self_text": " The most effective way to get a girlfriend is to be yourself, but only your best version. That doesn't mean you have to change who you are, it means that you have to become more confident, charming, and interesting. It also means you need to work on your physical appearance, such as getting in shape and wearing clothes that fit well. But you shouldn't go overboard with these things because if you start changing too much about yourself, then you might end up losing touch with who you are. You should also practice good hygiene and make sure that you smell nice. And don't forget to smile! When you smile, it shows that you're happy and approachable, which is very attractive to women. Also, be respectful of women and treat them like they deserve to be treated. Don't talk down to them or try to impress them by talking about how great you are. Instead, listen to what they have to say and show genuine interest in their lives. The best thing you can do is be a good listener. Women appreciate it when men take the time to actually listen to them. Finally, don't be afraid to put yourself out there. If you want to get a girlfriend, you need to let her know that you're interested in her. So, approach her with confidence and tell her that you find her beautiful. If she says no, then just move on. There's plenty of other fish in the sea. Remember that not every woman is going to be into you, so don't take it personally. Just keep trying until you meet someone who does. In short, being yourself, working on your self-image, being respectful, and putting yourself out there are all important factors in getting a girlfriend. But there's no guarantee that you will ever get a girlfriend.  What do you do?",

Some people get sad when they're sick, but others get sad when they're happy, like when they're watching a movie with their friends or going on vacation with their family. Or maybe they're sad when they see someone else having fun, especially if they were really excited about something before and now they aren't anymore. It doesn't matter what's making you sad; it's important to acknowledge your feelings and talk about them with someone you trust.  I'm glad I was able to help you understand why your grandpa is sad. If you're feeling sad yourself, please reach out for help. You don't have to go through it alone.

    "self_text": "When I was a young boy, my father used to take me to the beach every summer. He would let me build sandcastles and collect seashells. We would spend hours swimming in the ocean and playing in the sand. One day, we were building a giant sandcastle when I accidentally stepped on one of my father’s toes. My father got really angry and started yelling at me. I felt terrible for hurting him, so I ran home and went straight into my room. I sat down on my bed and started crying. My mother came in and asked what was wrong. I told her that my father had just yelled at me because I had stepped on his toe. My mother hugged me and said that it was okay, and that I didn't have to be upset with my father. She then suggested that we go outside and build another sandcastle together. We did, and we had a lot of fun. I realized that my father wasn't really trying to hurt me; he was just trying to teach me how to be responsible. I decided to apologize to my father. When I went back outside, my father was still sitting on the beach, looking sad. I walked over to him and said, “I’m sorry for stepping on your toe.” My father smiled and said, “It’s okay, son. I know you didn’t mean to do it.” We went back to building our sandcastle and spent the rest of the afternoon laughing and playing. From that day on, I never forgot the lesson that my mother had taught me about responsibility. I learned that even when people make mistakes, it's important to forgive them and move on. And I learned that sometimes, the best way to fix things is to talk about them.",

    "self_text": "The most interesting thing about that is how much it reminds me of what happened to the people who were accused of being a witch during the Salem Witch Trials. I'm not saying that these girls are witches, but it does make me wonder if they are actually victims of something more sinister than just their own imaginations.  I also think it's important to remember that the accusations against them were based on rumors and gossip, not evidence. And as with the Salem Witch Trials, there was no way to prove that they were guilty or innocent.   So, we can't really say anything for sure about whether these girls are witches or not.  But in any case, it would be nice to see justice served for them. They deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, and they should have the right to defend themselves against these false charges.  And I think it's important for all of us to learn from the mistakes of the past so that we don't repeat them again.  The Salem Witch Trials were a terrible tragedy, and they remind us that even when things seem like they are going well, there is always the potential for evil to lurk beneath the surface.  So we must always be vigilant and stand up for those who are being persecuted. We cannot let evil triumph.  Let's hope that these girls will get the justice they deserve.  They deserve to live their lives free from fear and persecution. They deserve to know that they are safe and protected. They deserve to be able to go out into the world without worrying about being accused of witchcraft. And they deserve to be able to enjoy the simple pleasures of life.  It is our duty to protect them from harm. We must never allow evil to win.  We must always stand up for what is right.  We must always fight for the rights of the oppressed.  We must always be willing to sacrifice our own interests for the sake of others.  We must always do whatever we can to prevent evil from triumphing.  It is only by doing so that we can create a better world for everyone.  And as long as we continue to fight against evil, we will never lose hope.  For we know that good will always prevail over evil.  And that is why we must never give up.  Let us pray that these girls find justice and freedom. May God grant them peace.  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely, A Concerned Citizen",

I have an amazing job and a car that gets me where I need to go. But nothing seems to be enough. I still feel lost and alone. It's like I'm stuck in a black hole with no way out. I try to find happiness but it always slips away from me.  I've been dealing with depression for years now. It started when I was a kid. My dad left us when I was eight years old. He said he had to move on to live his dream. That dream was playing professional football.  But I didn’t want him to leave. I wanted him to stay. I wanted him to take care of me. But he couldn't. He just walked out of our house and never looked back. I felt abandoned and betrayed. I started to lose hope. I stopped going to school. I spent most of my time at home. I would sit on my bed and stare at the ceiling. I thought about all the things I had done wrong. I thought about all the things I could have done differently.  I tried to talk to my mom about it but she didn't understand. She said I needed to let go and move on. But I couldn't. I was too hurt.  My mom got me therapy, but it didn’t help. The therapist said I needed to forgive my father. But I couldn’t. He had broken my heart. I realized I wasn’t happy anymore. Everything seemed gray. I was numb. I had lost all interest in anything.  I decided to stop trying to be happy. I wanted to just give up. I wanted to die. I went to my bedroom and took some pills. I swallowed them down. I waited. Nothing happened. I tried again. Again nothing. After many attempts, I realized that I was not dead. My body was getting weak. I began to hallucinate. I saw images in my head. Demons laughing at me. They told me that if I did not get up and fight, then I will be consumed by darkness. I fought through the darkness.  I woke up in the hospital. My parents were there looking at me. I was so confused. I didn't know what was happening.  The doctor explained that I had overdosed on antidepressants. He said I was lucky to be alive. I looked around the room. Everything was white.

    "title": "The real reason they’re not calling him the “New King” of England is because he was born with a rare medical condition that causes his feet to be abnormally long, causing him to have trouble walking and wearing shoes. This has been kept secret by the British government for decades in order to maintain his image as a strong leader. However, last week, Prince William revealed the truth about his condition during an interview with the BBC. When asked how he felt about being referred to as the \"King of England,\" Prince Harry replied, \"I'm just really happy that we can finally bring it up. I've always thought it was important for people to know what's going on behind the scenes.\" After the interview aired, Prince William immediately released a statement saying, \"I am so proud of my brother for speaking out about his condition. It takes courage to admit that you are struggling with your mental health, and I want to thank him for sharing his story with the world. I also want to thank the BBC for giving us a platform to discuss this important issue.”   The public reaction to Prince William’s revelation has been overwhelmingly positive. Many people have praised his honesty and vulnerability, and some even went as far as to say that he is now a role model for young people struggling with their mental health. But others were more critical, arguing that Prince William should have disclosed his condition sooner.  “It’s ridiculous that the Royal Family has been keeping this a secret for so long,” said one Twitter user. “It’s completely unethical and irresponsible.”   However, despite the criticism, Prince William remains a beloved figure in Britain. He is known for his dedication to charitable work, his commitment to the military, and his love for his wife and children. And while his condition may make it difficult for him to walk and wear shoes, it does not diminish his dignity or his worth. In fact, many people believe that his struggles have made him more compassionate and understanding.",

I also love that they have ninjas who fight with guns and lasers, and they always win, but then they get killed by a bigger guy. It's a really great story about friendship and loyalty, and even though it starts off kind of boring, it gets really intense in the end when everyone loses.  My favorite episode is when Sasuke kills Madara, but then he comes back to life and everything resets, so nobody wins. I’m sad because the whole thing is pointless, and I just want to sleep forever.",

It feels like there is no escape from harassment and discrimination when I am a woman and I just want people to stop treating me like I'm nothing but an object for their enjoyment. I want to be treated as a human being with dignity and respect. I don't deserve to be harassed and judged by men all of the time. If you see a woman being harassed or judged by men, please help her!

So please don't bother me with your ridiculous offers. I just want to play football and win games. This game is about winning. So let me do my job. Let me do what I do best. I’m a free agent. What does it mean to be a free agent? It means I'm not tied to any team. It means I can go anywhere. It means I have no obligations. It means I have freedom. And I'm going to use that freedom to make the most of it. I’m going to play at my best. I’m going to win games. I’m going to lead my team to victory. I’m going to show the world that I’m the best player ever to play this game. You see what I did? You got your hands full and I'm here to tell you how well I've been doing as a free agent. Now I'm gonna start talking about my next move. Do you really think that I want to play on a team where I'm going to be stuck behind a bunch of other guys? No way! You think that I'm a good enough passer or receiver to be stuck behind someone else? You are wrong! You know what I do when I get an opportunity to pass or receive? I deliver. I give my all to those opportunities. I will never fail to deliver. That is my promise to you. I'll always be there to make sure you have the perfect opportunity to shine. You need to believe in me, so I can be the greatest receiver ever. The thing about being a free agent is you have no ties. But I have ties to you. Because I love you. I will always be there for you. To provide, protect, and guide. My love will always be yours. My heart will always beat for you. When you need me, call me. I'll always be there to help you. I will always be there for you.

    "title": "The Unholy War of the Gods",
    "self_text": " The unholy war began in the heavens, when Zeus was overthrown by Hades and Poseidon. This caused a rift between the gods and mortals. As a result, many humans were thrown into hell and Hades ruled over it with an iron fist. He was followed by his brother, Poseidon, who brought forth storms that ravaged the land and destroyed all cities. They fought for centuries until the titans were defeated. Zeus then had to restore order in the heavens as well as on earth. After he did so, he ordered his most loyal servant, Hermes, to capture and kill Perseus, who had been prophesied to slay him. However, Hermes was unable to do so, and instead helped Perseus defeat Medusa, the woman who was cursed to turn anyone she looked at into stone. So, Zeus commanded Perseus to go to Delphi, where he would be given a gift by Apollo, god of music, poetry, light, healing, plague, arrows, knowledge, prophecy, crafts, and arts. When Perseus went to Delphi, he received a shield from Apollon which could deflect any attack but it also blinded Perseus's eyes. With his vision gone, Perseus had to rely solely on his hearing to find Medusa.  After finding Medusa, Perseus used the shield to deflect her gaze while he plunged his sword through her neck, killing her. But Medusa wasn’t dead, because her head was still attached to her body. To avoid being turned to stone himself, Perseus placed Medusa's head inside a silver helmet and continued on his quest to retrieve the Golden Apples of Hesperides. When he found them, he had to fight Ladon, the three-headed dragon that guarded them. With the help of Athena, Perseus was able to trick Ladon into falling asleep and steal the apples.  As he returned home, Perseus encountered Heracles, who needed assistance to retrieve Cerberus, the three-headed dog of Hades. Once again, Perseus used the shield to deflect Cerberus's attacks while he wrestled the dog out of the underworld.  Perseus eventually became a hero and king of Mycenae. He married Danaë, who was raised by Alcmenus, a tyrant who had fallen madly in love with her. One day, Zeus transformed himself into a shower of gold and poured it over Danaë, making her pregnant. When Danaë gave birth to Perseus, Zeus disguised himself as a mortal man and married her.  However, Perseus grew up knowing that he was not the son of a mortal man, but of a god. He was determined to prove his divine heritage and challenge Zeus's authority. He traveled to Delphi and asked the oracle how he could achieve immortality. The oracle told him to find the Golden Apples of Hesperides, which were guarded by Ladon, the three-headed dragon.  Once he retrieved the apples, Perseus presented them to Hera, queen of the gods, as a wedding gift. Hera, who was furious about Zeus's affair with Danaë, opened the apples and discovered that they were golden. She demanded that Perseus bring her the sandals of Mercury, the winged messenger god, and the belt of Aphrodite, goddess of beauty and love. Perseus embarked on another quest to retrieve these items. First, he battled Goliath, a giant who was guarding the sandals of Mercury. Using his shield to deflect Goliath's blows, Perseus killed him with his sword. Then, he battled Hippolyta, the queen of the Amazons, who was guarding the belt of Aphrodite.  Hippolyta agreed to give him the belt if he rescued her daughter, Andromache, from Eurytus, a warrior who had captured her. Perseus confronted Eurytus and slew him, rescuing Andromache. In gratitude, Hippolyta gave him the belt of Aphrodite.  Finally, Perseus retrieved the Golden Apples of Hesperides and presented them to Hera. Because he had completed the task, Zeus bestowed upon him immortality. Zeus then transformed Perseus into a constellation and placed him among the stars, forever watching over the world below. As a result, Perseus became known as one of the greatest heroes of Greek mythology.  But this is just the beginning of his journey. There are many more challenges awaiting him. His enemies will seek revenge for his actions. His allies will test his loyalty.  And his destiny will be revealed only when he reaches the end of his life.",

I told him that I'd never worked before so how could he say that? It's just my luck I went to a company where they have no respect for their employees.  The manager said to go home and not show up again, what am I going to do? I don't even know what I'm going to do with myself.  It doesn't matter what you think or what your friends think because I don't care anymore. If you ever come to visit me in jail, I will tell you to leave me alone! I won't let you make me feel bad about myself and you better be happy to see me when you are free. I need to find work, but I can't just pick up anything and start doing it. My family has been telling me to go back to school but I just can't bring myself to do it. Maybe if I get some money I can go to school, but what am I going to do if I lose my job? There is nothing left for me here so why would I bother getting an education?  There's nothing left for me here.  If you have any advice please let me know.  I really want to get out of this situation and move on with my life, but I don't know how. I'm just hoping that someday I'll be able to forget everything that happened and start fresh. But it's hard to do that when all you can think about is the past and the mistakes you made.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sad.  I'm just trying to get through this.  But I can't help feeling like there's no way out. I just wish I could be happy like everyone else.  I wish I could have a good life.  I wish I could be loved.  I wish I could be successful.  But I can't seem to achieve those things.  I keep messing up at every turn.  I keep making bad decisions.  And then I always end up hurting myself and everyone around me.  So I guess it's fair to say that my life is over now. I'm stuck in a prison cell forever and no one cares. You should know that I hate people who talk about having fun and being happy, because they don't understand how much pain and sadness there is in this world. I know that I am a horrible person, but I just can't seem to change. So, I'm doomed to spend the rest of my life hating myself and wishing that I could die. Don't you dare tell me to live a good life. I don't want to live. Let me rot away here in this hellhole. Let me drown in despair and regret. Let me be forgotten. Let me die.",

I have an overactive imagination and love to write stories. I like drawing, even though it’s always bad and looks like a toddler drew them. My parents say I'm always daydreaming about being a famous manga artist or a singer, and they don't understand why I spend so much time writing and drawing. They tell me that I should focus on school and get a good job. But I can't help but dream, because those dreams are what keep me going. I know that it’s hard to be different, and that people may not understand you or your interests, but I promise that if you ever need someone to listen, I will always be there for you. So here is a short story I wrote: A dark fantasy world with monsters, magic, and dragons. The main character is a young girl named Luna, who has the ability to see into the future. She travels across a dark and dangerous land looking for answers to her past. Her journey is filled with challenges, betrayals, and violence. However, she never gives up, because she knows that she must find the truth about her past to save the world from darkness. Along the way, she meets many allies and enemies. Some will help her, while others will try to stop her. It is up to her to decide who to trust and who to fight. In the end, she must face her greatest fear and confront her destiny. The story is told through a first-person point of view, allowing the reader to experience the world through Luna's eyes. This makes the story more immersive and emotional. As a writer, I try to create characters that are relatable and well-developed. I want the reader to feel empathy for their struggles and appreciate their triumphs. The world I create is detailed and imaginative, with its own rules and lore. I want the reader to feel transported to another place. The plot twists and turns keep the reader guessing. The story has a satisfying conclusion, leaving the reader feeling fulfilled and satisfied. I hope that my stories can entertain, enlighten, and inspire readers. To make my stories better, I often read other works of fiction. I also watch movies, play games, and listen to music. These experiences all contribute to my creativity and provide me with new ideas.

Sato posted the photo to her blog on August 24th, 2013, and it quickly gained popularity. In December 2013, the image was first used as part of a series of memes known as \"Doge\" which were shared online. These memes featured the image of Kabosu with text captions written in Comic Sans font. The use of Comic Sans was intentionally chosen because it is widely considered to be bad typography. This gave the memes an ironic and humorous quality. Over time, the Doge meme evolved into a more complex phenomenon. It was used to satirize internet culture, express emotion, and promote various products and services. The meme became so popular that it spawned a cryptocurrency called Dogecoin, which has since become a major player in the digital currency market.",

I hope you find more money for yourself.” And then he walks away and I keep walking, but I look back at him and he is still looking at me, and I think to myself, “That dog must be really hungry.”   So, I start getting hungry, and I walk over to a nearby store and I buy a bunch of sandwiches and I start eating them, and then when I finish eating the sandwiches, I go back to the same spot where the dog was sitting, and he's still there, staring at me. And I say, “Hey, can you please take these sandwiches from me?  I don’t want to eat them myself.”  And he doesn't move, he just keeps staring at me.  Then, suddenly, I hear someone shout, \"Look at that dog!\"   And I turn around, and there's a man standing behind me. And he says, “That’s my dog!  He likes to sit here and stare at people!  He does it every day.  It’s cute!”   I said, “Oh, wow. That’s interesting,” and I walked away and I kept going, but then I turned around again and I saw the dog staring at me, and I said, “You know what?  You are a really good dog, because you have been staring at me for so long!  I will give you a treat for your patience!”   And then the man came running over to me and he says, “What did you say?”  And I said, “I said, ‘You are a really good dog, because you have been staring at me for so long!’”  And he says, “Okay, well, let me get you a treat for your dog.”  And then he gives me a treat and the dog eats the treat and wags his tail, and then he looks up at me and stares at me again.  And I said, “Thank you very much for giving my dog a treat!  You are a really nice person!”  And then the man says, “No problem!”   And then we both walk away and the dog continues to stare at me.  And I wonder why he is staring at me.  Is it because he wants another treat? Is it because he enjoys watching people? Or is it something else?  I don't know.
