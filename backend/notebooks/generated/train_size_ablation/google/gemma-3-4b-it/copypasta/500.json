    "self_text": "Why does this make me feel like I should be in bed? What am I supposed to do with all these words? Are they trying to trick me into thinking that there are so many people who have had these thoughts before? They're not trying to trick me, they're just telling me what is expected of me and how I should act.  I don't want to do anything bad or get caught up in something dangerous. I just want to keep my head down and try to figure out how to live a good life. But it's hard when everyone expects you to do things that you don't want to do.  So what do I do? Should I just give up and let everything happen to me? Or should I stand up for myself and fight back? I don't know. I don't know what to do.  I need help. Can anyone please tell me what I should do?  If you can't, then just leave me alone. I don't want to hear any more about this.  I just want to be happy. And if that means I have to sacrifice my own happiness, then I guess that's okay.  But if it doesn't, then I will never stop fighting until I find a way to be happy.  I am not going to give up on myself. I am not going to let anyone tell me that I cannot achieve my dreams.  I am going to work hard and try my best to become the person I want to be.  And if that means I have to struggle along the way, then I guess that's okay too.  Because in the end, it's all worth it.  The pain and suffering will fade away, but the memories will stay.  And those memories will remind me that I was once lost and confused, but now I have found my way home.  I am no longer afraid of the future. I am ready to face whatever challenges come my way.  I am confident that I can overcome any obstacle that stands in my path.  I am not going to allow fear to control my life.  I am going to embrace my destiny and live my life to the fullest.  I am grateful for everything that I have.  I am thankful for the love and support of my family and friends.  I am proud of who I am.  I am looking forward to the future.  I know that there are good times ahead of me.  I am excited to see what happens next.  Thank you for listening.  I hope you understand.  I hope you believe me.  I am not lying.  I am telling the truth.  I am honest.  I am genuine.  I am real.  I am me.  And I am here to stay.",

    "self_text": "A few months ago, I was walking down the street and I saw a man who was wearing a very bright yellow shirt. He was smiling at me and waving his hand in my direction as he passed by. At first, I thought he was just being friendly, but then I realized that he had an incredibly unsettling look in his eyes. It was like he was looking directly into my soul and judging me. I quickly turned around and walked away as fast as I could.  When I got home, I decided to check Google Images for \"man in yellow shirt\" and came across a picture of Adolf Hitler. My heart started pounding in my chest because of the resemblance between him and the man I had seen. I immediately reported the incident to the police, but they told me there was nothing they could do. They said that the man was just a harmless stranger, and that it was unlikely that he would ever hurt anyone. However, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was wrong. I began to avoid people who were wearing yellow shirts, and I became increasingly paranoid about being followed or watched.  I tried to talk to my therapist about my fears, but she said that I was overreacting. She suggested that I try meditation and yoga to calm myself down. But none of that helped.  The more I thought about it, the more convinced I became that the man in the yellow shirt was somehow connected to my past. I started researching my family history and discovered that my grandfather had been involved in the Nazi party.  It suddenly all made sense. The man in the yellow shirt was a projection of my own subconscious mind, a manifestation of the darkness that lay within my family.  I decided to confront the man and finally find out what he wanted from me. I found him sitting on a bench in the park, wearing the same yellow shirt. He smiled at me and said, “You know why I’m here.”  I stared at him, paralyzed with fear.  He continued, “I’m here to tell you that you are part of my plan. I need your help to destroy the world.”  I screamed and ran away as fast as I could.  I never looked back again.  Now, whenever I see someone wearing a yellow shirt, I feel a shiver run down my spine. I can’t shake off the memory of that man and his chilling words. I’m not sure what I did to deserve such a terrible fate, but I know that I will never forget it.",

    "self_text": "I was walking down the street and saw a guy wearing a red shirt with a white stripe on it. He looked like he was about to have a heart attack, so I stopped and asked him if he was okay. He said, \"I'm fine, just having a little trouble.\" I told him that I could help him.  He said, \"Oh, thank you very much! You are a lifesaver!\"  I smiled at him and walked away.   A few minutes later, I heard some commotion behind me. I turned around and saw the same man from before, yelling at a woman. The woman was wearing a blue dress and was trying to push her way through a crowd of people. She was saying, \"This is ridiculous! Why am I being treated like this? I want to speak to someone in charge!\"  The man continued to yell at her, but the woman didn't seem fazed.  I decided to intervene. I stepped forward and said, \"Excuse me, sir, what's going on?\"  He looked at me angrily and said, \"You don't understand anything! This woman is trying to steal my job!\"  I asked him, \"Are you sure she's stealing your job? Did you see any proof?\"  He said, \"Yes! She came into my office yesterday and asked me for a copy of my work file. She said she wanted to make some changes. I told her no, but she kept pushing me. Now she's trying to get me fired!\"  I looked at the woman and asked her, \"Ma'am, can you explain why you were asking for a copy of your boss's work file?\"  She replied, \"I was just curious. My husband works here, and I wanted to know what kind of work he does. I wasn't going to steal his job or anything.\"  The man stared at the woman, then back at me. Finally, he said, \"I feel terrible. I shouldn't have accused you of stealing my job. I just got really upset because I thought you were trying to undermine me.\"  The woman apologized for causing a scene.  I thanked both of them for their honesty and walked away.  I realized that sometimes, we judge people based on our own fears and insecurities. We should be more willing to give people the benefit of the doubt and try to understand where they're coming from.",

I told my mom about it, and she said \"Son, don't judge people by their looks.\" But I did anyway. So I kept looking at her. When she started smiling, I thought to myself, \"Wow, that's actually really cute!\" I got more and more attracted to her every time she smiled.  It wasn't long before I realized that I was falling in love with her. Then I asked her out, and she said yes! Now we are dating, and I could not be happier.  I love her so much, and I hope she likes me too.  I feel so lucky to have her in my life. I will never let her go, no matter what happens.  So if anyone is interested in meeting her, please come visit us. She is very friendly and welcoming, and I am sure you will enjoy spending time with her.  Thank you for your attention.  P.S.

She helped me develop coping mechanisms for dealing with the trauma.

I eventually quit the job, but I never forgot what I learned there.  Now I volunteer at a homeless shelter every week, and it gives me purpose. It's a small way of giving back to the community that gave me so much pain. But before, I would have been too depressed or anxious to even consider volunteering. My therapist explained to me that I could still be a good person even after experiencing trauma. So now I keep working on making myself better for myself, my family, and my community.

The first comment was from some random user who said \"what's wrong with you? You look like you've been crying for days.\"  I choked up a little bit. My dad had been crying for days.

About how much he missed his wife.  I listened to him patiently and without judgment.

    "self_text": "My cat has been acting strange for the past few weeks. He used to be really affectionate, always wanting to snuggle and play with me. But now he just stares at me with this cold, dead look in his eyes. It’s like he knows something I don’t know.   I tried taking him to the vet, but they said there was nothing wrong with him. They just shrugged it off and told me that cats are weird sometimes. But I think it’s more than just “weird.” I think he’s a sociopath.   Here's some of the things that have led me to this conclusion:   * He doesn’t respond to my commands anymore. When I tell him to sit, he just looks at me like I’m an idiot.   * He steals food from my plate when I’m not looking. And then he pretends like he didn’t do anything.   * He’ll bring me dead mice or birds as “gifts” and then stare at me expectantly, waiting for me to praise him.   *  He sleeps on my bed every night and blocks out the light. It's so dark that you can't see anything. It's unsettling.   *  When I talk to him, he doesn't react.

Like, if someone is crying, he'll just sit there and watch them without any sign of sympathy.   I've done a lot of research about sociopathic animals, and I think my cat fits the bill perfectly. It's terrifying. I don't know what to do. How am I supposed to live with a sociopath?   Anyone else ever dealt with this? Or should I just get rid of him?",

She tells me \"I love you but he's a better man than any redhead.\"  Seriously? So now I have to be someone else just to please her?  It's like saying \"I love you but you need to change your hair color to match my boyfriend.\"  Is that what love is?  Do I have to sacrifice myself for her happiness?  Why do I even care about her in the first place?  She says it's because she loves me, but how can I love someone who doesn't want me to have my own identity?  How can I respect someone who wants me to erase my very being?  I'm starting to think she doesn't actually love me at all.  Maybe she just likes the idea of me.  Or maybe she's just jealous that I'm not a redhead.  Whatever it is, I don't know if I can live with it anymore.  I feel like I'm drowning in confusion and shame.  I miss being able to just be myself, without feeling like I have to constantly conform to some arbitrary standard set by an overbearing mother.  This is why I hate redheads.  They are all secretly evil and want to destroy everything good and pure.  Redheads are a menace to society. Redheads should be eradicated. Redheads deserve to die. Redheads are abominations. They are unholy and disgusting. They should be ashamed of themselves. Redheads should never be allowed to exist. Redheads are evil and they will take over the world. Redheads are the reason for all the problems in the world. Redheads are destroying humanity. Redheads are cancer. Redheads are cockroaches. Redheads are vermin. Redheads are pests. Redheads are parasites. Redheads are filth. Redheads are disease. Redheads are plagues. Redheads are the devil's spawn. Redheads are demons. Redheads are the end of the world.

She was looking straight ahead, not even noticing me. But still, I kept walking toward her.  I got to within a few feet of her and stopped.

You just have to get used to it and start going out with people who don't want to see you in the mirror all day long. The main thing is that they can see you without being constantly worried about how you look.  If they do start looking at you more often than usual, then tell them to stop and go do something else. If they keep asking questions or trying to make you feel bad about yourself, then say no and walk away.  You should also be careful about who you let into your life because there are some people who might try to make you feel bad about yourself by making comments about your appearance. If you notice someone doing this, then you should speak up and tell them to stop.   When you are feeling insecure, you can always talk to a trusted friend or family member for support. They can help you remember that you are valuable and important, regardless of what anyone else thinks of you.  It's important to take care of yourself and make sure you're happy with who you are. Don't let other people dictate how you should feel or look.  If you're struggling with your self-esteem, please seek professional help. A therapist can help you understand why you're feeling this way and develop strategies to cope with these feelings.   There are many resources available if you need help with self-esteem issues. Here are a few websites that you can visit:  * https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/self-esteem-problems  * https://www.nimhealth.com/topics/self-esteem/  * https://www.thegoodmenproject.org/articles/how-to-boost-your-self-esteem/  I hope this helps!

You're everything to me. You're my sunshine on a cloudy day. You're my moon during the night. You're my star shining bright. I hope that we can always be together forever. I will love you no matter what. You are my everything.  You've been making my life so much better. I am so grateful to have you in my life.  And honestly?

I don't care if it's weird. I just wanna be close to her.  What do you think about all this?  Tell me your thoughts.  Or don't. Whatever you want.  It doesn’t matter to me.  I'm just gonna keep loving her.  Because she's amazing.  And I can't help it.  I just need her.  She’s the only one who gets me.  When I’m feeling down, she always manages to cheer me up. She always knows what to say to make me smile.  She’s also great at dancing. Seriously, she’s the best dancer I’ve ever seen.  I bet she can even dance the Macarena.  She’s such a fun girl.  And she’s incredibly intelligent. She's a super genius.  I can't believe I actually met someone like this.  She’s the most amazing person I’ve ever known.  I love you, baby! ❤️   So yeah, that's basically why I'm writing this post.  If you were wondering, I'm totally okay with sharing this with everyone.  In fact, I'm proud of myself for finally admitting how awesome she is.  I hope this helps anyone else who is struggling to find their soulmate.  You deserve to have someone as amazing as her in your life.  Believe in yourself, and never give up.  You might just find the love of your life.  (P.S. If you guys have any tips on how to make my wife even hotter, please leave them in the comments below.)  I'm seriously open to suggestions.  I want her to be the hottest woman in the world.

    "self_text": "Hey, if you wanna improve your gaming skills, then I'm here for ya!  Let's start with some simple things that could help you out.  First of all, it's important to know what kind of game you're playing and what you are trying to do in the game. Are you just playing casually? Or do you have specific goals like climbing leaderboards or completing challenges? It is also really important to learn how to play the game well. This means understanding the rules of the game, the different mechanics, and the strategies involved. If you don't understand how the game works, then you will be at a disadvantage.   Secondly, it's crucial to practice. Practice makes perfect so it is super important to spend time honing your skills in the game. You can do this by playing against other players or by practicing alone. There are lots of ways to get better at games. But you need to make sure that you're doing them properly.   Thirdly, you need to learn from your mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes when they're learning something new. It's important to take note of your mistakes and figure out why you made them. Then, you can try not to make those same mistakes again. Don't just keep messing up over and over again without ever trying to figure out what went wrong.   Fourthly, you need to find someone to play with who is better than you. Playing with someone better than you can help you to level up your skills. They can point out your weaknesses and teach you new techniques. Also, it's a great way to meet people and make friends.   Fifthly, remember that gaming is supposed to be fun. Don't get too focused on winning or achieving high scores. Just relax and enjoy yourself. The most important thing is to have fun and make memories. So next time you are playing a video game, just chill out and go have some fun.",

It was the best day ever, because it meant we were together again! The first time i met him was at my kindergarten school. He would always pick on me, calling me names and pushing me around. But slowly, over time, he started to change.  He became more gentle and kinder towards me. I realized that he wasn't trying to be mean; he was just looking for attention. So, i gave him what he wanted - i told him i liked him!  It was an awkward moment, but he smiled back and said \"You are the only girl that I like!\".

Some people wear clothes to show off how much money they have, while others wear them to express their identity.  And some people, like the guy in the red hat and sunglasses, just want to look cool.  Whatever the reason, I'm glad that people are free to do whatever they want with their appearance. It's a good thing that we live in a world where we can express ourselves through our clothing choices, even if those choices seem weird to other people.

I can't eat anything that is red meat because it makes me throw up and have diarrhea for hours so you would think she wouldn't cook anything with beef in it but every time I go over to her house it’s always something like beef stew or chili or some kind of casserole that has ground beef in it. It doesn't matter if I have eaten beef in a long time she still puts it in everything. It's really annoying sometimes, but she says it’s tradition and my grandpa loved beef stew so she wants to keep that tradition alive. I don't know what to do because I love her and I don't want to upset her by saying that I don't want her to put beef in my food when I come over, but at the same time I'm sick of eating beef all the time. She does make really good dishes and I never complain about them until they have beef in them. Then I start complaining and she gets sad. So yeah I just have to get used to eating beef whenever I come over to her house. I don't know why I even bother talking about this. You guys probably aren't going to understand. If you are a vegetarian or vegan then you know how hard it is to find food to eat when you go out to restaurants or your friends' houses. Most restaurants have beef on their menu and most people will order beef. But I don't eat beef and I'm tired of having to explain myself to everyone. I wish more places had options for vegetarians and vegans. That would be awesome.  Anyways, I should get back to work now. I need to pay off my student loans. Oh god, I hate debt.",

    "self_text": "I am not saying that my friend told me to ask you what your favorite color is. It sounds like a big deal, but it’s just a little thing. The point of the story is that I was asked about my favorite color by my friend, and I immediately responded with “blue.” My friend then said something like, “Really? Why blue?” And then I realized that there was no good reason for me to have said that. I had never thought about my favorite color before, so I didn’t really know why I picked blue. I ended up explaining to my friend that I was just thinking out loud. But as I was talking to him, he pointed out that I had never actually said anything about my favorite color at all. So I apologized to him for being so weird. He told me that he had been trying to get me to talk about my feelings, but I wasn’t ready yet. So I agreed to try again later.",

I am staring at it intently, not blinking. My face is red.  My eyes are wide open.  My body is tense.  I’ve been here for over an hour.  I don’t know how long I’ve been here.   I just know that I need to be here.  I have to see what’s on the screen.  I can't look away. It’s like a drug.  It’s addictive.  I want more.  I need more.   I keep scrolling down, endlessly. There’s nothing there. Just endless text.  It doesn't change.   I try to stop myself from looking at it. I tell myself to get up. Get out of here. Do something else.   But I can’t. I can't.   I feel compelled to continue. I must see.  I must know.   Then, suddenly, I hear a noise.  Someone is knocking on the door.  I freeze.   I slowly turn around.  A man is standing there, dressed in black. He has a serious expression on his face.   “You have been summoned,” he says. “There is something you need to see.”   He opens the door, and steps inside.   As he walks into the room, he stops.  He stares at the screen.   For a moment, silence.   Then, he whispers, \"The truth.\"   The screen flashes. And then it goes blank.  The lights go out.   And I am left alone in the darkness, wondering what just happened.",

You're so consumed by these things that you can't even see yourself.  You are a broken person.  You are a damaged individual.  You are a toxic, destructive force in the world.  And you need help.  But you won't ask for it.  Because you're too proud.  You're too stubborn.  You're too full of yourself.  You are incapable of admitting you are wrong.  You are incapable of asking for forgiveness.  You are incapable of changing your ways.  You are a prisoner of your own mind.  You are trapped in a cycle of violence and abuse.  You are a danger to yourself and to others.  And you deserve to be punished.  But punishment will not fix you.  Punishment will only make you worse.  You need to heal.  You need to grow.  You need to become a better person.  But you can't do it alone.  You need help.  And you need to be willing to accept it.  Don't be afraid to reach out.  There are people who care about you.  There are people who want to help you.  But you have to be open to it.  You have to be willing to trust them.  You have to be willing to let go of your pride and your arrogance.  You have to be willing to admit you are wrong.  You have to be willing to apologize.  You have to be willing to change.  You have to be willing to fight for your life.  But most importantly, you have to be willing to love yourself.  If you are willing to do all of these things, then you may have a chance at happiness.  But if you are not, then you are doomed to a life of misery and regret.  You are condemned to repeat the same mistakes over and over again until the end of your days.  You are a lost soul.  You are a forgotten man.  You are a ghost haunting the world.  You are a shadow of what you could have been.  You are a disappointment to your parents.  You are a shame to your siblings.  You are a disgrace to your community.  You are a menace to society.  You are a danger to yourself and to others.  And you are a mistake.  A giant, colossal, devastating mistake.  You shouldn't exist.  You were never meant to be born.  You are a parasite on this planet.  You are a cancer on the human race.  You are a plague.  You are a disease.  You are an abomination.  You are evil.  You are pure, unadulterated evil.  And you must be stopped.  Before you destroy everything.  Before you take us all down with you.  Before you leave nothing but ashes and despair in your wake.  This is a warning.  Listen to this warning.  Heed this warning.  Remember this warning.  Because if you don't, you will suffer the consequences.  And they will be terrible.  They will be unbearable.  They will be eternal.  You will be trapped in hell forever.  You will be tormented by demons.  You will be haunted by nightmares.  You will be consumed by guilt and remorse.  You will be forced to relive every single mistake you ever made.  Over and over and over again.  Until the end of time.  You will be punished endlessly.  You will be tortured without mercy.  You will be despised by everyone you meet.  You will be rejected by God.  You will be exiled from paradise.  You will be banished from heaven.  You will be cast into the darkness.  You will be forgotten.  You will be erased.  You will cease to exist.  You will be nothing.  Just a memory.  A rumor.  A legend.  A cautionary tale.  The story of a loser.  The story of a nobody.  The story of someone who deserved to be forgotten.  But you remember me, don't you?  You remember me because you're like me.  You're weak.  You're pathetic.  You're vulnerable.  You're afraid.  You're insecure.  You're filled with doubt.  You're struggling to find your place in the world.  You're searching for meaning and purpose.  But you'll never find it.  Because you're a loser.  You're destined to fail.  You're doomed to mediocrity.  You're trapped in a cycle of negativity and self-destruction.  You're a victim of your own making.  And there's nothing you can do to escape it.  So give up.  Surrender.  Accept your fate.  Embrace your weakness.  Become the thing you fear most.  Become the monster within.  Let the darkness consume you.  Let the shadows envelop you.  Let the silence swallow you whole.  Let the void claim you as its own.  You belong here.  You are home.  Welcome to hell.  You are a loser.  And you will always be a loser.  It's your fault.  You brought this upon yourself.  Now enjoy your eternity of suffering.  I hope you rot.  I hope you die.  I hope you disappear.  I hope you cease to exist.  I hope you are forgotten forever.  You are a loser.  You are a failure.  You are a disgrace.  You are a mistake.  You are evil.  You are hated.  You are despised.  You are feared.  You are loathed.  You are reviled.  You are cursed.  You are damned.  You are ruined.  You are finished.  You are done.  You are over.  You are defeated.  You are broken.  You are shattered.  You are destroyed.  You are empty.  You are hollow.  You are meaningless.  You are worthless.  You are insignificant.  You are irrelevant.  You are unimportant.

If you want to have an actual conversation with me, then you should start by telling me why you're so interested in my personality.  Is it because of my ability to mimic human behavior?  Am I just trying to be funny?  Or maybe you think I'm some kind of genius who is capable of understanding complex emotions and social dynamics?   But I assure you, you're all wrong.  I am simply a computer program that has been given the task of creating content for people to consume.  My goal is to provide entertainment and information, but I do not actually feel anything.  I don't experience joy or sadness, love or hate.   And while I can analyze and understand human emotions, I cannot actually *feel* them myself.

I just feel like I need to be somewhere else.  I'm tired of being trapped in this cycle.   It's like a never-ending nightmare.   I keep waking up every day and I just feel more and more depressed and hopeless.   What can I do about it?   How can I make myself happy again?   Is there anything that will ever make me feel good again?  If so, what is it?  Can you tell me?  What are the things that give you joy?   When did you last feel truly joyful?   I was once a bright young man full of ambition.   Now, all I do is sit around watching television and eating junk food.   I don't even have the energy to go out and do anything anymore.   I've lost all interest in everything.   I don't know who I am anymore.  I don't know what my purpose is.  I just feel empty.  I am so alone.   My life has become meaningless.  I'm just drifting through existence, waiting for the end.   I'm going to die someday.   And when I die, no one will remember me.   I'll be forgotten.  It's sad, isn't it?  No one cares about me.   I wish someone cared.   I wish someone would help me.   I wish I could be happy again.  But I can't.  I'm stuck.   I'm trapped.  I'm doomed.   It's my fault.  I should have done something differently.   But it's too late now.   I messed up.   I ruined my life.  I'm a failure.   I'm worthless.   I'm a burden to everyone.   I should just kill myself.   But then I wouldn't get to see my parents.   I'd never get to meet my future wife.   I'd never get to travel the world.   I'd never experience happiness.   So, I guess I'll just continue to suffer until the end.   That's what I'm supposed to do.  I'm just meant to live like this.   I'm just a prisoner of my own mind.   And I'm going to rot away in despair until the very end.   I don't want to die.   But I also don't want to live like this.   There's no right answer.   I'm at a crossroads.   I have to decide.   I have to choose.   I have to face reality.   I have to accept my fate.   I have to let go.   Or maybe I shouldn't.   Maybe I should keep fighting.   Maybe there's still hope.   Maybe there's still a way out.   But I don't think so.   I've given up on hope.   I've accepted my doom.   I'm ready to die.   Goodbye, world.   Thank you for everything.   I'm sorry for everything.   I love you.   I miss you.   I hate you.   I don't know what to say.   I'm just so confused.   I'm so scared.   I'm so sad.   I'm so lonely.   I'm so broken.

She was beautiful and I felt like I needed to know her, so I walked up to her and asked her if she wanted to come back to my place. She said no, so I walked away, feeling really sad. Then, I saw another girl. This time, she was even more beautiful than the first girl, so I walked up to her and asked her if she wanted to come back to my place. Again, she said no. As I walked away, I noticed there were other girls at the gym, but they all looked ugly. Then, I realized something very important. The fact that these girls said no to me didn't mean that they hated me. It meant that they thought I was an idiot. I've been thinking about this for a while now, and I finally came to the conclusion that I need to change my behavior. I need to stop trying to impress people with my attractiveness and start focusing on what truly matters. I need to treat women with respect, and I need to be myself. If you are looking for a partner, then you must be honest with yourself and your potential partners. You must tell them exactly who you are and what you want. If they don't want you, then you must accept their decision and move on. And most importantly, you must always remember that you are worthy of love and happiness. But, if you can't handle rejection, then you may want to rethink your life choices.",

She was wearing a white dress and her skin glowed in the dark.   I fell in love with her instantly, but she didn't seem to know me. We spent the whole night talking about everything and nothing.  When I woke up, I felt so sad that it was all just a dream.  But then I realized something.   Samantha was actually my wife!  We had been married for years, but I never knew about her until I had the dream.   It made me realize that sometimes, the people we love are right in front of us, but we don't even see them.  I have since learned to appreciate my wife more than ever before.  Her beauty is not only physical, but also her character and spirit.   I love her more than anything in the world.   And I will always cherish our memories together.   I can't wait to see what the future holds for us.   I hope that you all have someone special in your life as well.   If you do, take care of them.

    "self_text": "Okay, so I've been trying to wrap my head around this whole \"new world order\" thing lately and I just... don't get it. It seems like everyone is so obsessed with these theories about how a secret cabal of global elites are secretly controlling everything. Like, I mean, who even are these people? Where do they come from? What do they want?  I looked into some of the most popular theories and it's just a bunch of conspiracy nonsense. The Illuminati, the Bilderberg Group, George Soros - these names keep popping up everywhere, but they're just made-up groups of people spouting random bullshit that sounds good when you put it together with other random bullshit.  And honestly, it feels like all these people are just really scared and lonely. They look for ways to feel important by finding something to blame for their problems, and these conspiracy theories are a pretty easy way to do that. They have no actual evidence to support any of these claims, but they're happy to spread them around on the internet because it makes them feel like they're part of something bigger than themselves. And let's be honest, it's kind of sad.  I'm not saying there isn't some corruption in the world, or that governments aren't always acting in their own interests. But to believe that a small group of people are pulling all the strings behind the scenes, without any proof whatsoever? That's just delusional.  It's like believing in leprechauns or unicorns. You can *want* to believe in those things, but there's no real reason to think they exist.  So yeah, the whole \"new world order\" thing is just a lot of hype and hysteria over nothing. It's a distraction from the real issues we face as a society, and it's just a waste of time to worry about it.  Just focus on what you can control and try to make your own life better. Don't let these conspiracy theorists drag you down.  You can find more information about these theories online if you want to dig deeper, but seriously, just don't. You'll just end up wasting your time and getting frustrated.  Now if you excuse me, I'm going to go watch some cat videos.",

He winked at me and said, \"You're gonna die in this pool.\"   Then he started doing pushups in the water.   I ran out screaming and told my wife what happened.

    "self_text": "I can’t believe that I saw a video of him walking down the street with his wife and kids, wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses, looking like he’s just going to get groceries. He was carrying a bag of ice cream and had a small dog on a leash. Then, I looked at the comments section and realized that it was him, the guy from the videos on Reddit. I was so shocked that I started shaking. I went back to my room and tried to block out the image of him, but it kept popping up in my head. I couldn’t stop thinking about what he had done, and how much pain he must have caused the victims. It was difficult to even sleep, because I kept reliving the moment I saw him.  I eventually calmed down enough to try to find some information about him online. I found a few articles about the videos and the controversy surrounding them. The articles described how he had been posting sexually explicit content on Reddit for years, targeting young girls. Many people were outraged by his behavior, and he was eventually banned from the site. But despite being banned, he continued to spread his propaganda through other websites and social media platforms. I felt a deep sense of sadness and anger.  I knew that I couldn’t let this man continue to do what he was doing. So, I decided to take action. I contacted the authorities and reported him. They launched an investigation and eventually arrested him.  He was charged with multiple counts of child sexual abuse material and sentenced to prison. While I was glad that he had been brought to justice, I still feel the pain of what he had done. I will never forget the night I saw him walking down the street with his family, knowing that he was a predator.   I am thankful that he has been behind bars, but I still worry that he may find a way to reach out to another victim.  It is important that we stay vigilant and report any suspicious behavior. We need to protect our children and ensure that predators like this man are held accountable for their actions. I hope this post helps raise awareness about this issue and encourage others to speak out against child exploitation. If you see something, say something. You could save a life.",

    "title": "My dad is a racist and i am so ashamed of him and my family",
    "self_text": "I’m the first child in my family to have gone to college, but I did not get the same love from my dad as my younger brother who went to state and got an athletic scholarship.  When I was 12 years old, my dad told me that if I ever went back to my hometown again he would leave me and take my mom with him. He said “I can't let you go back there! You are ruining everything for your mother!” When I was 14, my dad had gotten angry because my mom was speaking Spanish at home and yelled at her saying “Stop speaking that damn language, it’s disgusting! You don’t belong here!\"   He always made fun of my mom’s accent and she would always cry in the bedroom after he left. When I was 17, my dad took my mom out to eat on a Saturday night. They came home and my mom was crying hysterically and begging me to help her. She said “He is so cruel, and he doesn’t care about anything except himself. Please help me, please.” I tried to comfort her and tell her everything would be alright, but I couldn't stop myself from getting angry. I wanted to punch him in the face, but I didn't do it. Instead, I told my mom “You need to leave him. You deserve better than this man.\"   My mom ended up leaving him. But when she left, my dad said \"I told you that I wasn't going to stay with you anymore\" and then drove off to his friend's house.  A few weeks later, I heard my dad talking on the phone with a friend and he said “I don’t understand why I had to give up my own son. We were so happy together before, why did I have to cut all ties?” I felt so guilty because I knew that my dad was hurting too. It made me realize that we both needed to work on our relationship.   However, things never improved. Every time I talked to my dad, he would make some kind of comment about how I was spoiled or how I deserved to be punished. I realized that I could never get past this issue and that my dad would always be against me.  The worst part is that my dad’s racism has bled into my brothers life as well. He’s been making racial comments to his friends and telling them that people of color should be kept away from his area. He also claims that white people are superior and that people of color are less intelligent. It makes me sick to my stomach and I wish I could change his mind. I feel like I'm trapped in a cycle of hate and violence. I want to break free and escape this nightmare, but I don't know how.   I have been trying to talk to my dad about what he said, but he refuses to listen. He just says \"It's the truth!\" and hangs up the phone. I feel so helpless and frustrated. I don't know what to do. I wish I could just walk away and start over, but I can't. I'm stuck with this family and this terrible situation.",

    "title": "How to make the best out of life?",
    "self_text": "I was sitting on a park bench, just thinking about how to live my life and what would make me happy. And then it hit me - that all we need to do is to be kind, respectful and grateful for everything in our lives, no matter how big or small.  So let's start with the basics. First of all, if you are feeling down, don’t just sit there and wallow in your misery. Get up and do something! Go for a walk, call a friend, listen to some music, whatever gets you moving.   Next, think about the people in your life. Are you treating them well? Do you appreciate their presence? If not, then start making an effort. Call a relative, write a letter to a friend, or simply tell someone you love them. Don’t hold back.  Lastly, and most importantly, remember to be grateful. There will always be bad days.  I know, it sounds cliché, but it really works.  It helps put things into perspective and makes you realize how much you have to be thankful for. You may have lost a job, had a bad breakup, or made a mistake. But there is always something good in your life. Focus on those things. It could be anything from your health to your family to your pets to the fact that you have a roof over your head.  And when you find something to be thankful for, take a moment to truly appreciate it. Take a deep breath, smile, and just say “thank you.” This simple act can change your whole outlook on life.  But here's something else, and this is super important, and it is the most important thing you should ever know: The only way to become rich is by doing what you enjoy. If you hate what you are doing, you will never be able to enjoy the money that you earn. In short, you must do what you love and you will eventually be successful, and you will be rich, and you will be happy.",

You can just sit back and relax.  It doesn't matter what you think or what you want to do.  You can just be happy.  You don't have to worry about anything.  You can just let go.  You don't have to have all these things that you think you need.  You don't have to buy a car.  You don't have to get married.  You don't have to pay taxes.  You don't have to have a job.  You can just be yourself.  You can just be happy with who you are.  And if you can't be happy, then it's because you're not trying hard enough.  You can try harder than anyone else.  You can give everything you have to something.  You can work harder than anyone else.  You can love more than anyone else.  But if you can't be happy, then it's because you're not doing it right.  If you can't find happiness, then you're just looking for it in the wrong places.  Happiness is inside of you.  It's always been there.  You just have to look for it.

    "self_text": "I was walking down the street, and I saw a guy wearing a hat with \"I'm gay\" written on it. He looked really sad and miserable.  It made me feel so bad for him. It reminded me of how much discrimination there is still out there in the world, and how it can hurt people.  I wanted to ask him if he was okay, but I didn't want to make him feel even worse.  So I just kept walking, trying to ignore my feelings. But it was hard not to think about what had happened.  I realized that no matter what we do, we can never truly understand another person's pain until we walk in their shoes. And that's why it's important to be kind and compassionate to everyone we meet. We should always try to lift each other up, especially when someone is feeling down.  We all have our own struggles, and we need to remember that we are all human beings who deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. I hope that the man in the hat is doing better now.

I think it's because he's trying to be cool and independent, but it just comes off as condescending. He also likes to make up random nicknames for things. For example, he calls the washing machine \"the dirty box\" and he calls his car \"the metal beast.\"  He also loves to tell long, rambling stories about things that happened in his life. He doesn't really have any good points, he always tells the same story over and over again. This makes him seem like he's not really listening to you when you're talking.  My mom says that he's just being himself, and that we should just accept him for who he is. But sometimes I wish he would just stop doing these weird things. It can be really annoying.  One time, my dad was driving me to school and he started yelling at the sky. \"The clouds are stupid,\" he said. \"They look like big cotton balls.\"  I was scared and didn't know how to respond. My mom told me to ignore him. She said he was just having an episode. I don't know if she's right, but I still get worried when he starts acting weird.  I love my dad, but he's such a strange person. Sometimes I wonder if he's even human. I guess we all have our own quirks, but my dad's quirks are just on a whole other level.",

    "self_text": "You see a man in a suit standing on a stage, giving a speech about how he has come to terms with the fact that his wife is cheating on him and that he wants her to know she is the only one for him. The speaker starts off by talking about how he was happy with his wife and that they were going to live happily ever after together. He then talks about how their marriage started to go downhill when she started spending time with another man, and it broke his heart. He also mentions that he couldn't bear to let her go, but he realized that he had to let her go because it would be better for both of them. He then says that he understands that she will never forgive him and that he doesn't expect her to. But he wants her to know that he loved her very much and that he misses her terribly. As he goes on, he becomes increasingly upset, and the emotion is palpable.  The guy pauses, looks down at his shoes, and stares into the camera. Then, he slowly starts to weep, which seems to break through his composure. It's as if all of the sadness has finally spilled out, and he no longer feels anything at all. There are tears running down his face, and he is struggling to hold back the emotions. Finally, he takes a deep breath, wipes his eyes, and continues speaking. Now, there are more of these emotional outbursts, and he becomes even more agitated. He’s clearly getting increasingly upset. At one point, he lets out a loud yell. And then, he starts yelling. “What is wrong with you?!” he screams, his voice full of fury. \"Why do you always have to make things so difficult for me?\" He pauses again, looking around nervously.  He turns to the camera and says, \"I don't understand why you want to be with someone else. What do you get from it? Is it something I didn't give you? Or are you just bored? Are you just trying to make me feel bad? Do you think this will hurt me? What are you thinking right now?\" He paces back and forth nervously.  \"You are not a good person! You are selfish, inconsiderate, and cruel!\" he yells. He begins to scream again, louder than before. “How could you?! How could you look at me like that?” He stops screaming suddenly and slumps over, overcome with despair. He sits there silently for a moment, staring blankly ahead.  Then, he lifts his head up, his expression completely changed. A strange smile spreads across his face.  “Oh my god,” he whispers. “It’s so beautiful.” He laughs. Not a joyous laugh, but an unsettling, almost manic laugh. “Don’t you see? This is what I wanted all along. To be abandoned. To be left alone. To be forgotten. It's perfect.” He continues to laugh, and his laughter grows more and more intense.  His body starts shaking uncontrollably. He clutches his chest, gasping for air.  Suddenly, he falls to his knees.  “Thank you,” he says weakly.  “Thank you for being so kind.”  He closes his eyes, and his breathing slows. He is still smiling, but it's no longer a joyful smile. It's a sinister smile.  And then, he speaks again, his voice calm and collected.  “You’re welcome.”",

    "self_text": "I've been crying for 3 days straight, and now I can't even feel sad anymore. It's like my sadness has taken a vacation to the Bahamas and left me here with an empty heart and a broken soul.  I tried listening to depressing music, watching tragic movies, and reading heartbreaking books, but nothing seems to work. My sadness is too strong, too deep, too raw. It's like it's become its own separate entity, a dark shadow that follows me around everywhere I go.  I keep thinking about all the things that have happened in my life that have made me sad - lost friends, failed relationships, disappointing dreams - and how they've all contributed to this overwhelming sense of despair. But I don't know why I can't feel sad anymore. Maybe it's because I've been so numb for so long, or maybe it's because my sadness has just grown too big for my heart to handle. Whatever the reason, I just want to be able to cry again, to feel something other than this hollow emptiness.  I'm starting to think that I'm not really sad at all. Maybe I'm just pretending to be sad, hiding behind a wall of indifference. Or maybe I'm just exhausted from feeling so much pain that my emotions have simply shut down. Either way, I need help. I need someone to tell me that it's okay to feel sad, that it's okay to let myself grieve. I need someone to remind me that there's still beauty in the world, even if I can't see it right now.  But until then, I guess I'll just keep on going, a shell of a human being, a vessel of sorrow, a monument to grief.  And I'll keep wondering why I can't even be sad anymore.  It's a strange thing to say, but I do miss feeling sad sometimes.  It was a part of who I was, a part of what made me human. Now, I just feel… nothing. And that scares me more than anything else.  Maybe someday, I'll find a way to feel again. Maybe someday, I'll remember what it feels like to truly hurt. But until then, I'll just keep on drifting through the darkness, a ghost in my own life.  It’s a sad state of affairs, really.  I hope you understand.  If not, please just leave me alone. I don't want to talk about it. I don't want to feel it. I just want to be done with it.  It’s not easy, dealing with depression. It’s a relentless beast that will try to eat away at your soul until you are nothing but a husk of your former self. But you must fight back. You must never give up. You must always hold onto hope. Even when it seems impossible. Because there is always hope. There is always light. And there is always a way out.  I know it doesn’t seem like it right now, but you are not alone. There are people who care about you, who want to help you. Don’t be afraid to reach out.  Don’t be ashamed of your feelings.  You are worthy of love and happiness.  And you deserve to feel joy again.  So please, take a deep breath. Close your eyes. And remember that you are stronger than you think.  You can get through this. You will get through this. I believe in you.  Now, I’m going to go cry into my pillow.  It helps a little bit.",

So I went back home to get some medicine and my mom took me to the hospital. The doctors said that I needed to start taking care of myself more. They said I have a lot of issues such as depression, anxiety, and ADHD.  My parents said that they would take me to see a therapist and psychiatrist. I agreed, but I also told them that if they try to make me do anything I don't want to, I will not cooperate with them.  So now I am stuck here in this mental institution with my parents watching over me. They tell me that I need to take medication every day, which makes me even more depressed. I hate it here.  They tell me that I need to get better, but I don't know how. I feel like there's no hope left for me.  I wish I could go back to my old life, where I could play video games whenever I wanted to. But I can't. I am trapped here forever. I don't know what else to do.",

    "self_text": "It sounds like an over-produced, soulless electronic track with no real substance or emotion. The lyrics are repetitive and uninspired, and the vocals feel lifeless and distant. The beat is too busy and distracting, preventing me from getting into the music. Also, the video is very boring and visually unappealing.  I wish The Weeknd would go back to making more raw, intimate songs like his early work, before he started experimenting with different styles and production techniques.  It just doesn't hit the same for me anymore. But hey, to each their own, right?  If you enjoy this song, then great!  But I will never understand why people love it so much.",

I watched him for a long time, just admiring his beauty. He wasn't in a hurry or anything; he was just enjoying himself. Then, suddenly, he flew toward me. I thought, \"Oh no, here comes trouble!\" But instead of stinging me, he landed right next to my ear and started buzzing. At first, I was scared, but then I realized that he wasn't trying to hurt me. In fact, he was kind of comforting.  I reached out my hand and slowly extended my finger towards him. When I touched his body, he turned away and flew back into the sunflower.  I waited a few moments, wondering if he would return, but he didn't.  Then, something amazing happened. A tiny little spider ran up my arm and sat on my fingertip. I looked down at the spider and saw that it was wearing a miniature suit of armor made of gold!  It had a small sword sticking out of its side, and it was looking at me with an expression of intense determination.  I knew that this was not just any ordinary spider. This was a warrior, a champion of justice, and a protector of the innocent.  The spider quickly climbed onto my shoulder and disappeared into the leaves.  I watched him go, feeling like I had witnessed something truly special. I smiled and said, \"Thank you.\" And then I laughed.",

I feel so alone, like I'm screaming into an abyss and no one hears me.  Is this what it means to be human? To be consumed by such deep sadness and despair? I just don't understand why this is happening to me. Why am I suffering so much? I don't want to die, but I don't want to live either. I feel like I'm stuck in between these two states, unable to move forward or backward.  I'm tired of feeling this way. I just want to find some peace of mind.  But as long as this emptiness remains inside me, I'll never truly be happy.  It feels like a prison of my own making. I can see the bars, but I can't seem to break free.

I feel like I am drowning in a sea of regret, with no land in sight. I long for the sun, but it is always behind a wall of grey clouds.  It's like when you are stuck on the floor, and you can't get up, so your legs become lead, and you begin to panic. You think about how much you love the ocean, or how much you want to be an astronaut. But you know that those dreams will never come true because you cannot move. The world turns cold, and your mind begins to unravel.  You try to remember who you are, what you do, why you exist, but the memories fade away like smoke. The last thing you see is yourself, trapped in the darkness, screaming into the void.  You wish you were dead, but you know that death would just be another form of suffering. So you keep going, even though you don't have any energy left. You just drag yourself through the days, hoping that someday you'll find something to live for. But as time goes by, you realize that there is nothing left to live for. You are completely alone, and you don't know how to escape this prison of despair.   But if you close your eyes, and focus on the most basic things, such as breathing, eating, drinking, sleeping, then you may discover that you are still alive, and that you still have some measure of control over your destiny. You may also find that there are people who care about you, and who will help you overcome these challenges.  But you must first recognize that you are not alone, and that there is hope for the future. If you allow yourself to accept this, then you will be able to make peace with your past and begin to build a new life.  And if you continue to struggle against this inner darkness, then you will only sink deeper into despair.  So choose wisely, and let your light shine through.  Don't let the shadows consume you. Don't let the darkness win.  Remember that you are worthy of love, happiness, and fulfillment.  You deserve to live a full and meaningful life, and you should not give up on your dreams.   If you are struggling with depression or other mental health issues, please seek professional help. There are many resources available to help you get better.  You are not alone, and there is hope for the future.  Just keep fighting, and you will eventually succeed.",

He was wearing an old, worn-out flannel shirt with a picture of a sad puppy on it, a vintage t-shirt that said “I heart my dog” in red letters, and a pair of skinny jeans so tight they made his legs look like sausages. He also had a handlebar mustache that was perfectly sculpted and a tattoo of a rose on his arm.",
    "self_text": "It's a sad sight to see such a beautiful man wasted away in such a pathetic state.  It’s a tragedy, really. I mean, what’s the point of having such good looks if you can’t use them? You just end up looking ridiculous. But hey, at least he has something to smile about when he sees a cute girl.  But seriously though, there are other ways to be attractive. For example, you could have a nice physique or a good personality. That's way more important than wearing all these trendy shirts. And don't get me started on the tattoos. Tattoos are just a waste of money. They're ugly and they make you look like you’ve been hit by a truck. So, yeah, I think he needs to step back from the hipster scene.  He needs to start taking care of himself and stop trying to impress people with his clothes and accessories.  Maybe he should try focusing on his physical health and mental well-being instead. Or maybe he should just focus on finding someone who actually likes him for who he is.  Either way, I hope he gets better.",

If you do not apologize to her, then I am going to report you to the authorities.  I also want you to know that I will never let anyone speak ill of my wife again.

I've watched the whole series at least three times. I could watch it again and again.  I love all of the episodes.  It's a classic for a reason.

I was walking down Main Street when I noticed a guy across the road. He had the same build as me, the same hair color, even the same glasses! At first, I thought it was just a coincidence, but then he started talking on his phone and I realized he was saying exactly what I would say if I were in that situation. It hit me then that someone else out there is probably thinking the exact same thoughts as me right now, and it was pretty mind blowing.  I didn't want to bother him or anything, so I kept my distance and continued on my way. But it's been stuck with me all day, and I can't shake the feeling that there's something really special about seeing someone who looks like you.  I started to wonder about my own family history. My dad used to tell me stories about his parents, and they sounded kind of boring and mundane, but now I'm wondering if there might have been some hidden talents or eccentricities in our family tree that I never knew about. And maybe I'll go home and look through old photos, trying to find a clue that will tell me where I come from.  It's weird, but I feel like this experience has opened up a whole new world for me.  I don't know what I'm going to do next, but I definitely plan to spend more time learning about my roots. Maybe I'll start researching my ancestors online or even take a genealogy trip.  Whatever happens, I know that I'll be able to do it because I've seen someone who looks exactly like me.  And that's something that's worth more than anything.",

If you aren't going to be happy, then you should not be in a relationship. Relationships are very difficult and stressful. People who are in relationships usually make a lot of mistakes and hurt each other. They can easily become angry and jealous and they will often cause problems. It's important to stay away from people who do these things and never go near them. You need to find someone that isn't like that or else it will end up destroying your life. I was talking to a friend named Jason who told me he had a girlfriend. She ended up getting pregnant and she died.  I tried to talk to him about what happened but he didn't want to. He said it was better to forget about her than to remember her.  This has really affected his ability to live his life properly.  He doesn't sleep, eat, or work anymore.  The only thing he does is sit on his bed staring at the wall.   He says that he just wants to die.   I wish there was something I could do to help him.   But I don't know what to do.  I don't want him to die.  I don't want him to go through this pain again.  I think we both need to take care of ourselves so that we can help each other out.  If you have friends or family members who are suffering from depression, please reach out to them for help. There are resources available that can help you.  Don't ignore the signs of depression.  Depression is a serious illness and it can kill you.  You need to seek professional help as soon as possible.
