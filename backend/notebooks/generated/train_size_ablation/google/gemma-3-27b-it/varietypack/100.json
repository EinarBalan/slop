The fact that we saw no underdog stories in these last two seasons, as well as the fact that the edit made it seem like the underdogs were really struggling, only makes things worse. There are too many people on the cast who don't know how to play Survivor properly, and they end up being carried by their allies. This season has been particularly bad, but the same can be said for the previous season. It seems like everyone has lost sight of what Survivor is supposed to be about.  I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way.   It's also important to note that the casting process has become increasingly focused on finding people who are physically attractive and have interesting backgrounds, rather than people who are actually good at playing the game. As a result, we've seen a lot of casts filled with people who are more interested in getting screen time than winning the game.",

They have LeBron and AD who can be top ten players when healthy and they have a bunch of shooters that can space out the floor. That being said, they need to add another ball handler/playmaker to take off pressure from Lebron and AD. Dennis Schroder could fill in that role but he's pretty inconsistent so it'll be interesting to see if Rob Pelinka will try to bring him back or get someone like Monte Morris or Tyus Jones. Also, Russell Westbrook has been very bad for them, as he doesn't really fit with the way the game is played today. He's too turnover prone and his shot isn't very consistent. So yeah, I think the Lakers can make the playoffs next year if they can stay healthy and make a few smart moves in free agency.",

However, I do think that his acting range is limited and that he often plays the same type of character over and over again.

    "self_text": "A new study has found that there's an ideal way to consume Oreo cookies. Researchers from Penn State University have discovered that dunking the cookies in milk for exactly five seconds yields the most satisfying experience.  The process goes like this: Dunk the Oreo in milk for five seconds, twist the two sides apart, lick off the creme filling, and finally enjoy the chocolate wafers separately. This technique maximizes both texture and taste.   According to the researchers, the dunking time of five seconds is crucial. Any shorter, and the cookie doesn’t absorb enough milk; any longer, and it becomes too soggy.  Additionally, separating the cookie allows you to savor each component individually, enhancing your overall enjoyment.  So, if you want to optimize your Oreo-eating experience, follow these steps!

He makes more money than me, but he is really great about us both having our own bank accounts and not being overly concerned with the finances. His mom has been making passive aggressive comments lately about how I “must be so happy” that he makes good money. She also keeps suggesting expensive things for him to buy me. Yesterday she made a comment at dinner saying “you must never have to worry about anything!” in front of all our friends and family. My husband was very embarrassed, but didn’t say anything.  I want to make sure everyone knows I am an independent woman who can take care of myself and doesn't need anyone to provide for me. I don’t know what to do. I don’t think yelling or arguing will help the situation. Any advice?",

I was thinking about telling the librarians that there is nothing wrong with wearing your shoes inside the building as long as you have been walking on clean floors.

Round your answer to the nearest foot.   2) The graph of the equation y=x^3 - x^2 + ax + b intersects the x-axis at (-1,0), (2,0), and (5,0). What is the value of a+b?   3) A circular garden has a radius of 7 meters. There is a path around the garden that is 1 meter wide. How many square meters does the area of the path equal?   4) When 30% of a number is added to the number, the result is 48.1. What is the number?   5) In the diagram below, ABCD is a rectangle with AB = 8 and AD = 6. Point E lies on CD such that AE bisects angle DAB. What is the length of DE?   Thank you very much!!",

I would never want to bother him as he is already busy enough with work.
