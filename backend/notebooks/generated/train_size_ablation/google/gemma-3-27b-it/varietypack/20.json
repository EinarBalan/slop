When I have a good listener, even if they don’t give me advice or anything like that, but just listens and doesn’t interrupt or try to talk over me, I feel better about myself. It feels as though you are being understood. It’s not always easy to be a good listener because sometimes we want to jump in with our own stories or opinions, but it’s so rewarding when you can truly hear someone out without judgment.

He says that if he really cared about her he would want to spend every moment with her. She's very hurt by these comments as she knows he loves her and they are still getting to know each other.  I tried to explain to my dad that people need their own lives and friends outside of relationships, but he thinks I am wrong and that he has more experience in life than I do. It seems like there's a cultural difference here; my parents came from an older generation where marriage meant spending almost all your time together.   He told me once that I was too independent and didn't value having a man in my life enough because I wanted to continue doing things I enjoyed after being married.    It's frustrating because I don't think he realizes how damaging those kinds of comments can be.  My sister is starting to question herself and whether or not she's being \"too needy\".

It seems like there are all these great options out there, but they’re either booked up for months or just don’t feel right when you meet them. So what do we need to be able to access more quality mental healthcare?  What makes a therapist “good”? Is it their education? Personality? Their experience with specific issues? Or something else entirely?  I think part of the problem is that finding a therapist feels like dating—you have to go through lots of bad first dates before you find someone who clicks. And even then, it takes time to build trust and rapport. What if we could make the process easier? Maybe a better way to match patients with therapists based on personality, expertise, and availability? Or maybe we need to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health so more people would become therapists in the first place? I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this.",

I used to have trouble getting to bed on time and had problems falling asleep because I couldn't shut my brain off at night. I was also really tired during the day and would end up taking naps when I didn't need them. It's been about a week since I started doing meditation before bed, and I think it has made a huge difference. My mind feels much more relaxed and peaceful when I get into bed, so it's easier for me to fall asleep. But as long as you can still function well throughout the day, don't worry too much about it.",

She now has a new family and doesn’t want any contact with me or our son. My heart is broken as it is to not be able to see my son but it also hurts knowing that he doesn’t even know who I am. I contacted my ex wife asking if I could at least get photos of him so I could just see how he looks but she blocked me on everything. I went to her home today hoping to catch her outside but she called the police on me saying I was harassing her. The cops told me they couldn’t help me because there wasn’t an active court order in place to see my son. So I had a lawyer draw up paperwork to get legal visitation rights and custody. After serving her papers she moved out of state without leaving a forwarding address. I hired a private investigator to find her and he tracked her down to North Carolina. I went to visit her and she refused to speak to me. Her current husband said I should leave her alone and that she will never let me see our son. I understand she may need space from me but I don’t understand why she would keep our son away from me. It isn’t fair to him. I feel like he deserves to know who his father is.”\\n\\nI think you are right to pursue your parental rights legally. It sounds like you've done everything reasonable to try and reach out and establish some kind of connection, and she is intentionally obstructing that.\\n\\nIt's incredibly painful to be denied access to your child, especially when the other parent seems motivated by spite rather than what's best for the kid. Don't give up. Keep fighting through the legal system. Document everything – every attempt to communicate, every instance of being blocked or harassed, etc. This documentation will be invaluable in court.\\n\\nConsider these additional steps:\\n\\n*   **Legal Representation:** Continue working closely with your attorney. They can advise you on the specific laws in both states (where you were originally located and where she is now) and navigate the interstate aspects of custody.\\n*   **Interstate Custody Laws:** Be aware of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA). This law determines which state has jurisdiction over custody cases involving children who live in different states. Your attorney will be familiar with this.\\n*   **Supervised Visitation:** If initial visits aren't granted, ask about supervised visitation. Even limited contact is better than no contact.\\n*   **Therapy/Counseling:** This situation is emotionally draining. A therapist can provide support and coping strategies.\\n*   **Focus on the Child's Best Interests:** Throughout the process, always emphasize that your goal is to be a positive influence in your son's life. Courts prioritize the well-being of the child.\\n\\nIt's going to be a long road, but your son deserves to know you, and you deserve the chance to be a part of his life. Stay strong and persistent.\"",

    "self_text": " The researchers discovered that there is a link between insufficient sleep and the release of cortisol — a hormone that regulates your metabolism and blood pressure — which can lead to mood swings, increased appetite and weight gain.   Researchers also found that people who don’t get enough sleep tend to experience emotional exhaustion, which can lead to negative emotions like sadness, frustration and anger.   “We know that sleep plays an important role in physical health, but we often underestimate its impact on our mental health,” said Dr. Amy Wolfson, a professor of psychology at Loyola University Maryland and co-author of the study. “This study shows that getting enough sleep can help you feel better about yourself and manage your emotions.”   Source: https://www.foxnews.com/health/insufficient-sleep-body-image-depression-anxiety-stress-study   #sleepproblems #bodyimage #mentalhealth #research #news #cortisol #emotionsexhaustion #anger #frustration #sadness #weightgain #bloodpressure #metabolism #loyolauniversitymaryland #drwolfson #people #feelbetter #help #manage #emotions #role #physicalhealth #impact #study #can #getenoughsleep",
