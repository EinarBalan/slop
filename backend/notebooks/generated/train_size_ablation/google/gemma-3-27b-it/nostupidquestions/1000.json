I think there needs to be a law banning any former politicians from holding public office again, or making money off of their past positions. This would help encourage more good people to enter politics because they know they won’t become millionaires at our expense. It would also give the public a little bit of hope. I don’t even understand why people vote if they are just going to get lied to and stolen from anyway.  I guess the simple answer is, we need term limits. But then what will these career criminals do with themselves once they are out of office?",

I think therapy is only necessary if you are struggling with something serious. Should I go to therapy just to make them happy? Or should I stand my ground and tell them that I don't need it?

Is there a limit to how much energy can be created by the sun through fusion? Or is it infinite?   I am asking because my science teacher told us today about how we are going to run out of fossil fuels and will eventually need to find another source of energy. He said that solar power could potentially solve our problems since the sun has an \"infinite\" amount of energy, which made me question if that is actually true.",
