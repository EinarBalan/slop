It does not matter if you leave it plugged in for hours after it is fully charged.   There are many safeguards in modern phones and chargers to prevent overcharging or overheating of the battery. However, it's still recommended to unplug your phone once it is fully charged because it can reduce the lifespan of the battery.  The battery is only rated for around 300-500 cycles before its performance degrades. The more often you cycle the battery, the faster it will degrade.
