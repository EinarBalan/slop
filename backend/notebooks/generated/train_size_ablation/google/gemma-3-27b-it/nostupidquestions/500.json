    "self_text": "I'm trying to understand how democracies work and I was looking at countries with different forms of governments. The US for example has a presidential system, where the executive branch (the president) is separate from the legislature (congress). Whereas in the UK the prime minister comes from the parliament (specifically the House of Commons), so there isn't really that separation. This seems like it would lead to more power being concentrated into fewer hands, and less accountability. Is there a reason why the UK decided to adopt a parliamentary system instead of something similar to the US?",
