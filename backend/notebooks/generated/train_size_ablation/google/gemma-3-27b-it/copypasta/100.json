They're getting a lot of attention and I want some too. So I guess I have no choice but to eat shit. I'm just hoping it doesn't mess me up for life.   It's kinda fun tbh. I can't believe how much shit my body has been able to process. I've eaten like 5 pounds of turds in the past month alone. And I haven't gotten sick once! But that's just because I'm immune now.  It's also really good exercise. Like, when you're trying to swallow a big wad of feces, your throat muscles get a real workout. And your stomach gets used to handling all sorts of weird stuff. It's pretty amazing, honestly.   It's kinda like yoga or something. You gotta be zen about it. Just relax and let the shit flow into your mouth. Don't fight it. Embrace it. That's what my guru told me, anyway. He's a big fan of poop eating. Says it opens up your third eye.  I'm still waiting for my third eye to open, but hey, at least I'm getting views.  I'll probably eat more shit today. Gotta keep grinding, ya know?",

But sometimes, when I'm walking down the street, I can't help but imagine what it would be like to fall onto a girl's breasts. Or maybe even get my face shoved into them.

And if so, why would anyone want that?  It seems really boring.  I understand there are many reasons someone might be a lesbian, and I don't want to offend anyone by asking this question, but I'm genuinely curious.  As a heterosexual man who has only ever had sex with women, I can't imagine why someone would choose to have sex with someone of their own gender.  I mean, isn't sex supposed to be about the thrill of the chase and the difference between men and women?  If you're just having sex with someone who is exactly like you, then where is the excitement?  Where is the challenge?  I know some people say that it's about emotional connection, but I think that's just an excuse.  If you really wanted an emotional connection with someone, you could just talk to them.  You don't need to have sex with them.  So, yeah, I'm just trying to understand what it's like being a lesbian.  I'm not judging anyone, I'm just curious.  I mean, I'm sure there are lots of things about other people's lives that I don't understand, but I try to be open-minded and respectful.  But honestly, the idea of having sex with another woman just doesn't appeal to me.  It seems really boring and repetitive.  Like, what's the point?  I mean, if you're just going to do the same thing you already do on your own, then why bother?  I guess it's just not for me.  But I still want to understand.  Can someone explain it to me?

I’m not saying the Quran is good, but at least it doesn’t have multiple authors editing it for millennia to make it better or fit their agendas. (Or worse) The Torah alone has like five different versions, so you can choose whatever version suits your agenda best. The first four books are just copies from Sumerian/Akkadian mythology with the names changed. And then they added extra stuff after that, which contradicts all previous texts. So now we have a text that doesn’t even follow its own rules anymore. Also, there were multiple people writing it over hundreds of years, and none of them ever met Jesus. They literally made up everything they wrote about him after he died. And then there’s Revelation, which is basically the author on drugs, describing what he sees in his mind while tripping. If anything, Christians should be burning Revelations instead of the Quran because it’s blasphemous to God. The only thing worse than the Old Testament is the New Testament. The New Testament makes God look like a complete idiot who could create humans and know exactly how things would turn out without knowing how they would turn out. If God created Adam and Eve knowing that they would sin, then why did He punish them? It's like if I set my dog up to fail by leaving food where he can reach it, then punish him for eating it. That's cruel and evil! God is literally setting His creations up to fail. How can anyone praise a God like that? That's the definition of abuse! Then He sends Jesus to die to save us from Himself! So now God needs saving? What kind of god needs saving? You need someone to save you from yourself? Sounds like a narcissist to me. Not to mention that Jesus says \"I am God\" in the bible, so now we have a narcissist god creating narcissistic humans. God is literally turning everyone into himself. No wonder nobody wants to worship Him. But hey, at least the bible contains some good quotes. Like when Jesus said \"Let the dead bury their own dead\".  That sounds really nice. Or when he said “I am the way, the truth, and the life”. Who cares about the rest of the world, right? As long as you have the truth, nothing else matters.

    "self_text": "I've had hemorrhoids for a while now, and it has been very painful for me to shit, so here are some tips that I have learned on how to make the experience less traumatic.  First of all, you need to prep your toilet. You want to get a lot of toilet paper in there to cover the water and help soften the impact when your shit falls into it. Then, once you sit down, you need to relax. This is difficult because you know something bad is about to happen, but if you tense up then it will be even worse. Now comes the hardest part: pushing. Don't push too hard or you may rip open the hemorrhoid and cause yourself more pain. Instead, try to ease it out as slowly as possible. If it hurts too much, stop and wait for a few minutes before trying again. Once the shit is out, wipe gently with soft toilet paper. If you don't have any soft toilet paper, just use whatever you can find. It doesn't matter if it's rough or abrasive, you won't feel it anyway. Finally, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Congratulations, you have successfully shitted with hemorrhoids!",

    "self_text": "My wife is from Thailand and she likes her Thai food extremely spicy, while I enjoy the occasional spicy dish, I cannot stand it when it’s too hot. We went out for dinner last night with some friends and my wife ordered a curry that she said was “medium” spice level, but for me, it would be absolutely intolerable. She insisted on ordering us both the same dish so we could share and experience the flavors together. When the food arrived, I hesitantly tried the curry, expecting to have my mouth burned off. But to my surprise, it was actually quite delicious! It had a nice warmth to it, but wasn’t overwhelmingly hot. I told my wife how much I enjoyed it and she smiled and said, “I told you it wouldn’t be too bad!” We continued to share the curry throughout the meal and I found myself really enjoying it. After dinner, as we were walking home, my wife asked me if I wanted to try something special she had been working on in the kitchen. She led me into the house and took me to the stove where she had a pot simmering. As soon as I got close, I smelled an intense heat coming from the pot. My wife explained that she had been making a chili paste using ghost peppers and habaneros, and she wanted me to try it. I politely declined, telling her that I appreciated the thought, but I just couldn’t handle anything that spicy. She looked disappointed, but didn’t push it. Later that night, as I was getting ready for bed, I noticed a small bowl of chili paste sitting on my bedside table. Next to it was a note that read, “Just a little taste 😉”. I sighed and knew I was in trouble. I tentatively dipped a toothpick into the chili paste and touched it to my tongue. Immediately, my mouth erupted in flames! I ran to the bathroom and gargled with water for what felt like an eternity, but the burning sensation wouldn’t go away. I finally managed to fall asleep, but woke up several times during the night with my mouth still on fire. The next morning, my wife asked me how I liked the chili paste. I forced a smile and said, “It was… interesting.” She laughed and said, “I know you can handle more spice than you think!” I realized then that my wife wasn’t trying to torture me, she just wanted to share her love of spicy food with me. And maybe, just maybe, she also enjoyed watching me suffer a little bit.",

It felt as though Ragnarok itself was happening inside me.  I tried to ignore it, thinking it was just pre-lift jitters, but then came the first pangs of pain. They grew in intensity until they became unbearable.  I knew I had to go NOW!  But there wasn't a bathroom nearby, only a row of treadmills and a few weight benches.  Desperate, I sprinted towards the nearest treadmill, hoping to find refuge behind it.  As I rounded the corner, my body betrayed me.  My anal sphincter failed, and a torrent of brown liquid erupted from my rear end with such force that it sent shockwaves through my entire being.  It splattered onto the treadmill, creating a disgusting mess of excrement and sweat.  The stench was so foul that people began gagging and covering their noses.  I stood there, frozen in horror, realizing what I had done.  A trainer rushed over, his face contorted in disgust.  \"What the hell?!\" he exclaimed.  \"You pooped on the treadmill!\"  I could only stammer out an apology, my voice trembling with shame.  \"I... I couldn't help it,\" I mumbled.  \"My bowels just gave way.\"  The trainer shook his head in disbelief.  \"This is unacceptable!\" he shouted.  \"You are banned from this gym for life!\"  And so, I was banished from the temple of gains, forever known as the man who pooped on the treadmill.  But even in disgrace, I found solace in knowing that I had achieved something truly epic.  I had unleashed a fury of fecal matter that would be remembered for generations to come.  For I am the poop warrior, the brown avenger, the master of the mighty bowel movement.  And my legend will live on, etched in the annals of gym history forevermore.  VALHALLA!",

Well, after a week or so, he calls me up and tells me that his stomach has gotten worse than before. So I ask him if he's still drinking the apple cider vinegar, and he says yes because he thought that maybe it just needed more time to work. So I tell him that he should stop drinking it and see if that helps, and he does and sure enough, within a day or two his stomach is back to normal. But then a few weeks later he decides he wants to try it again because he heard that it takes a while for it to start working, so he starts drinking it again and once again his stomach gets worse. This happens a third time too. And finally he asks me why it keeps making his stomach worse every time he tries it. So I ask him what kind of apple cider vinegar he's using and he says \"the really cheap stuff\" and I told him that he should get the good kind that comes in a bottle with the mother in it. So he goes down to the store and buys the expensive kind with the mother and starts drinking it. He drinks it for a week straight and nothing changes, so he gives up and stops drinking it and his stomach goes back to normal. Then one day when my mom is cleaning the kitchen she notices that there are three jugs of the cheap stuff that my dad bought stacked up in the pantry, so she asks him why he bought so much if he wasn't even using it, and he says that he was going to mix it with water and clean the floors with it.

Maybe I'm not meant to have a partner and I'm just gonna spend the rest of my life watching other people be happy while I rot away in my room. I wish I could disappear. Is there anyone out there who feels the same way as me????",

    "self_text": "My wife is a beautiful woman who I love very much. She’s the most beautiful girl in the world and all my friends say how lucky I am to have her as my wife. But goddamn, sometimes she does things that make me wonder if she has a single brain cell left in her head.  We were going on vacation last year and she had to pack for both of us because I was busy with work. She packed 10 pairs of shoes, three bikinis, four cocktail dresses and six outfits for going out to dinner. But when I asked her if she had packed some toiletries she said “Oh no! I forgot!” And then she told me to go back into the house to get them while we were already halfway to the airport. So I went back home and grabbed everything we needed and raced back to the airport. When I got there she was sitting at our gate wearing her best dress and heels drinking an expensive coffee looking like she didn’t even notice I wasn’t there.  I hate myself for saying this but sometimes I just want to strangle her. I feel bad about feeling this way but I can’t help it. It’s not like she doesn’t know what she’s doing either, she knows perfectly well what she’s doing, she just doesn’t give a fuck.  The worst part is she knows how mad I get and she loves pushing my buttons. I’ve tried talking to her about it but she just says “Oh come on, don’t be such a baby” or “You’re overreacting.”  I really do love her, but I think I need to start seeing someone else. Maybe someone smarter than her. Someone who won’t make me question whether I made the right decision by marrying her.",

    "self_text": "A fun fact about the number 1 anime is that it's a shitpost.  The show has no plot, the characters are underdeveloped, and the animation is low-budget at best. You can tell that the people who made this show were bored and decided to make something stupid for laughs. This is why so many fans of the show don't take it seriously. They know that it's just a joke. In fact, they enjoy it *because* it's a joke. It's like watching a really bad comedy movie with your friends. You laugh not because it's good, but because it's so bad. But if you try to watch it as a serious work of art, you'll be disappointed. If you think this is a great show, then you're either very young or have terrible taste in anime. There are thousands of other anime shows out there that are much better than this one.

We're using Unity btw",

When we got there she had me grab all these things for her to make dinner. She asked me if I wanted something, so I grabbed a juice box and started walking back to her when I saw it. The holy grail of snacks. A chocolate brownie. It looked amazing. So I grabbed it, walked up to my mom, and asked if I could get it. She said no because I just drank a juice box with a ton of sugar in it. But I told her I haven’t eaten all day. She gave me $10 and said I can buy whatever I want. I ran straight for the brownies, but they were all gone. Devastated, I started looking around for more. Then I see it again. Another chocolate brownie. I grab it, run up to my mom, and ask if I can buy it. She tells me to put it back because it isn't good for me. Then my brother comes along and sees what I have. He asks if he can have it. My mom says yes because \"he has been good\". I start getting angry. I tell my mom she is being unfair because I haven't done anything wrong either. She starts yelling at me about how I am always complaining and never appreciate anything she does for me. I yell back saying that is not true. We keep going back and forth until I storm off and sit on the floor. Then she says “if you don’t stop crying I’m leaving you here”. I start crying even harder. She then leaves without me and I’m left alone in the store.  My mom calls me after 5 minutes and tells me to come out and meet her by the entrance. I walk outside and my brother is waiting for me. He gives me his brownie.  The End",

My poop went from normal, brown, mushy soft serve to grey cement that could break rocks if thrown hard enough. It felt like it was going to rip my asshole into pieces every time I shit. I spent hours on the toilet trying to push something out but nothing came. I started getting stomach cramps from pushing so much and I thought I was dying.  I even tried soaking my butt in water just so it would be slippery enough to get the poop out. Nothing worked. I didn't want to go to the hospital or doctor because they were full of Covid patients.  I just kept eating nothing and drinking nothing until all the poo came out. It took almost two weeks before I had a good bowel movement again. I couldn't feel anything down there anymore. I have no idea what happened to all that crap that was stuck inside me. Did it dissolve? Did it turn to gas? Did it come out when I farted? I will never know. But I am forever scarred from this experience.  When I finally shitted after not having gone for two weeks I could see the bottom of my ass when I looked at the toilet. The only thing keeping me alive right now is the fact that the apocalypse hasn't happened yet.  But it will happen eventually. Then I can let loose and shit without worrying about running out of toilet paper. At least then I won't have to worry about any more pain.",

    "self_text": "I am a big fan of the Pokémon franchise and so are many of my friends, but after watching all of the episodes and movies on Netflix I have noticed something wrong with them. It is very hard to watch any of these shows or movies without noticing that there is an ungodly amount of black people in Pokémon, especially considering the fact that it is set in Japan. When I first started watching these shows I didn’t notice anything strange about the characters, but now that I think back at it I can tell they were trying to sneak in some diversity into their show by making a lot of the human characters look like black people instead of Japanese people. They did not do a good job hiding this, as it is quite obvious when you start looking for it. The same thing happens in the Pokémon movies, where the main protagonist always ends up being a black person. Even in the video games themselves, if you pay attention you will notice that the majority of the gym leaders and champions are black people. This makes me question whether the original game was originally created by someone who was white. Maybe he just wanted to make the franchise more diverse because his own country lacked diversity? Either way, I think that we should be critical of these types of things and call out the people who are trying to push an agenda onto us through our childhood memories.  The last thing I want to see happen is to let the world slowly get away with taking our culture away from us, replacing it with theirs. We need to protect what we love, and Pokémon has been around for so long that it has become part of our lives. I would hate to see it ruined by political correctness.",

I don't know why he's being like this, should I be worried? I love him so much and I don't want to lose him. :(",

    "self_text": "All you need is a toilet, some shit and a few days. It's best if it's left for over a week, as that will give it the best taste. If you don't have any shit, just steal some from your neighbor. Don't forget to add water! The more water, the better the crap. Just use enough to get it out of your ass without too much trouble. Once you've got all these ingredients, leave them inside your house until they become crap. It's important not to do anything with the crap once it's made, as that could ruin the taste. Now you can enjoy your very own crap! This recipe has been passed down through my family for generations, so I know it works. Please be careful when making crap, as it can be dangerous. Be sure to wear gloves and a mask, and wash your hands thoroughly after handling the crap. Also, be sure to dispose of the crap properly. You don't want to leave it lying around where someone could step on it.  It's also important to note that making crap is illegal in most places. So please be aware of the laws in your area before you start making crap.  If you follow these instructions carefully, you should be able to make your very own crap at home. And who knows, maybe you'll even be able to pass it down to your own children!",

I swear, all fighting game fans are just autistic little nerds who have nothing better to do than debate frame data for hours on end, so when someone comes along with a way to quantify quality, they immediately latch onto it like a leech.  It's like people think there's some sort of objective hierarchy of everything and if we can just create a tier list then we'll finally understand how the world works.  It's pathetic, honestly.

They're letting the planet die and they're letting people starve while they sit on mountains of cash.  They have more money than they could ever spend, but they hoard it anyway because they're greedy and selfish.  The scientists have been warning us for decades, but nobody listens because they're too busy living their lives and ignoring the problem.  We're all going to die and nobody cares.  God help us all.",

When I close my eyes I see all these beautiful women, but I know that they are all fake. They aren't real.  They're just figments of my imagination.
