    "self_text": "First of all, you need to be rich.  This is the most important thing. Girls care about money more than anything else. If you're not rich, then forget about it. You're never going to get a girlfriend.  Second, you need to be handsome. This is also very important. Girls want to be with someone who looks good. If you're not handsome, then you're out of luck.  Third, you need to have a good personality. This is less important than being rich and handsome, but it still matters. Girls want to be with someone who is kind, funny, and interesting.  If you can meet these three requirements, then you have a good chance of getting a girlfriend. But even if you do, there's no guarantee that she'll stay with you. Girls are fickle creatures. They can change their minds at any time. So don't get too attached.  If you're feeling down about your chances of getting a girlfriend, then just remember that there are plenty of other things in life to enjoy. You can focus on your career, your hobbies, or your friends. Don't let the lack of a girlfriend ruin your life.",

    "title": "The Real Meaning of Farting",
    "self_text": "We all fart, we have been farts since the beginning of time and will continue to be farts till our very last breath, it is a basic human function that cannot be controlled or ignored, it's a natural process, like breathing, eating, sleeping etc.  But what does it really mean? Well, I believe farts are actually ghosts who can't find their way out of your body, they get stuck in your intestines and when you try to release them they make a loud noise because they are screaming for help, but no one ever listens, so they just keep getting louder and louder until finally they explode out of your ass! Isn't that beautiful? It's almost poetic.  But there's more, did you know that every time you fart you're releasing a tiny piece of your soul? That's right, your soul gets smaller with every fart you let out, which means that if you fart too much you might eventually run out of soul and become an empty shell of a person, wandering around aimlessly trying to find meaning in life, but never finding it because you lost it all in your farts. So next time you feel a fart coming on, think twice about letting it go, you might be losing a piece of yourself in the process.  And don't even get me started on silent but deadly farts, those are the worst kind, because those are the souls of people who died without saying goodbye, they're trapped inside you forever, haunting your insides and making your butt stink like death itself. And what about ghost pepper farts? Those are the souls of demons, burning your insides and leaving a trail of fire wherever you go. But maybe, just maybe, farts aren't always bad, maybe some farts are angels, bringing joy and laughter to everyone around you, lifting spirits and making the world a better place. Or maybe they're just farts, who knows? All I know is that farts are mysterious, powerful, and sometimes smelly, and we should all embrace them for what they are: a part of being human.",

The performances are outstanding, with Ethan Slater as SpongeBob SquarePants giving a truly remarkable performance. Overall, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves musicals or just wants to have a good time. It's a heartwarming and uplifting story that will leave you feeling inspired and full of joy.",

Here's what I found:  Pussies have a better sense of smell than men do. They can smell things that men cannot even detect. This is because they have more olfactory receptors in their noses.  Pussies also have better hearing than men do. They can hear higher frequencies than men can. This is because they have smaller ears.  Pussies also have better eyesight than men do. They can see better in low light conditions. This is because they have larger pupils.  Pussies also have stronger muscles than men do. They can lift heavier weights than men can. This is because they have more muscle fibers.  Pussies also have faster reflexes than men do. They can react to stimuli quicker than men can. This is because they have shorter nerve pathways.  Pussies also have more endurance than men do. They can run for longer distances than men can. This is because they have more red blood cells.  Pussies also have more pain tolerance than men do. They can withstand more pain than men can. This is because they have more endorphins.  Pussies also have more intelligence than men do. They can solve problems quicker than men can. This is because they have more brain cells.  So, as you can see, pussies are clearly superior to men in every way. If you don't believe me, just ask a pussy!

He once tried to pickpocket me in the middle of a grocery store but I caught him and yelled at him.  He also likes to do things like tell me stories about how he used to bully kids back in high school.  But the weirdest thing he does is when he gets mad at me he starts speaking in tongues.  Like, he'll be yelling at me for something I did wrong and then suddenly he'll switch over to this gibberish language that sounds like a mix between Latin and Swahili.  It's really creepy and unsettling.  I don't know what's going on with him, but I think he needs help.",

I guess not, because those people would die anyway. So we can kill people if they're bad enough. What about if the ten people are just criminals? Or if they're just homeless people? Or if they're just poor people? And where do we draw the line? Is there such a thing as \"good\" and \"bad\"?  Is morality subjective? Are we all just animals?",

So I quickly got up and ran into the bathroom and started trying to plug it with tissue. It wasn’t working, so I grabbed some cotton balls and jammed them in there pretty hard. That didn’t work either. Eventually I realized I needed something more dense so I used toilet paper. And then that didn’t work so I thought “what about an ice cube?” But I couldn’t reach any ice cubes from where I was standing because they were in the freezer which was too far. Then I had a brilliant idea! What if I just stood over the sink and blew my nose? So I did that and nothing happened so I tried again but harder this time and I accidentally shot a stream of blood into the mirror. It went everywhere and it was hilarious. The worst part is my mom walked in right after and she was furious. She said I made a mess and I ruined her bathroom. She also said I was being ridiculous for trying to stop a nosebleed with toilet paper and ice cubes. But I don’t care what she says, it was still funny.",

About a month ago, my doctor started me on another medication called clozapine to help reduce my symptoms further. It seems like it is helping, but lately I've been experiencing some strange things that are making me wonder if I'm losing touch with reality again. Sometimes, when I look at people, their faces seem distorted or they appear to be looking right through me. Other times, I hear voices whispering in my ear that aren't there. I know these could be side effects of the medication, but it's still scary to experience them. I feel like everyone around me is judging me and plotting against me, even though I know logically that isn't true. I'm starting to become paranoid and anxious all the time, and it's interfering with my ability to function normally. I can barely sleep anymore because I'm constantly worried about what might happen next. I'm afraid to go outside or interact with other people, fearing that something bad will happen. Has anyone else experienced similar symptoms while taking clozapine or other antipsychotics? What did you do to cope with these feelings and regain your sense of reality? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  I also want to mention that I'm not currently under any immediate threat of harming myself or others, but I'm concerned about where this is heading if things continue to worsen. I just need to know if this is normal and how long it usually takes for these side effects to subside.",

You get to play as an animal and go on adventures in a world filled with other animals. But there is no real story or challenge. It's just a bunch of random stuff happening. And when you try to do something interesting, it gets ruined by the fact that you have to watch ads every few minutes.  I am so sick of seeing these YouTubers sponsoring games that are nothing more than glorified ad farms. They should be ashamed of themselves for promoting such garbage to their viewers. If you want to support good content creators, please don't watch any videos about this game.  I can't believe how many people fall for this crap. They see a popular YouTuber playing a game and they think it must be good. But that's not true. The only reason why these YouTubers play these games is because they get paid to do so.  I swear, if I ever meet one of these YouTubers in person, I'm going to tell them exactly what I think of them.",

The worst part is, if I get hired somewhere else, the cops will find out about it. And what if I go back home? She has a whole network of people in the police department and they would probably arrest me for something stupid just to make me suffer.

I was just surfing the web when suddenly I saw an ad for something like \"You are the third visitor today!\" and clicked it (I know, I know) and now there is a new app that appeared on my phone called \"Worms\" and it won't let me delete it.  It keeps saying \"App is essential to your system\" even though I don't use it at all.  The icon looks like a green worm and I think they stole all of my data because every time I open a webpage or an app, I get bombarded with ads for worms, so my phone has become useless.  Is there any way I can remove this without resetting my phone?  I have really important photos and videos on here that I don't want to lose!

If you don't have anything like money or fame, then you can try to get a degree or learn a skill but it will take years of hard work and dedication.  But the easiest way to get a woman to love you is to be rich or famous. Women are attracted to men who have power and status, and they will often overlook other flaws in a man if he has these qualities. So if you want to find a wife, then I recommend that you focus on making money or becoming famous. It's the best and only way to make a woman want you.",

    "self_text": "The radius of the sun is approximately 695,000 kilometers (432,000 miles), which is about 109 times the Earth's radius.  The distance from the Sun to the Earth varies throughout the year as the Earth follows an elliptical orbit around the Sun. However, on average, the distance between the Sun and the Earth is about 150 million kilometers (93 million miles). This distance is known as one astronomical unit (AU).  Thus, the radius of the sun/distance from the earth = 695,000km / 150 million km = 0.00463 = .463% of the earth. That means that if you were to fly out to the surface of the sun with a spacecraft in your hands, it would take approximately 463 years to reach the surface of the sun while travelling at 1 kilometer per hour.   In conclusion, the sun is not big enough to make a meaningful dent in the radius of the earth. It would be like trying to extinguish a fire by pouring a cup of water on it.   That is all.

Like, he has a tragic backstory but he never deals with it. All he does is pretend like nothing happened. And everyone says he's the best doctor? What are you smoking? The only reason people like him is because they're kids who don't understand what good storytelling is. They just want someone funny and cool. But he's not funny. He's just obnoxious. And he's not cool. He's just a dork. If you think the 10th doctor is good then you have bad taste.  I would rather watch the 5th doctor than the 10th doctor any day.",

    "self_text": "I was a guitarist in an orchestra, but got fired for hitting the conductor with my guitar. In my defense, he told me to \"play it like you stole it\" and now I am banned from all orchestras. Also, I once wrote a song about how much I love the guitar called \"I love guitars\". It became a hit among other guitarists. But then people started saying that it was too simple and repetitive. So I rewrote it with more complex chords and rhythms. Now nobody likes it anymore. So here's what happened:  The first time I played the guitar, I thought it was easy. All I had to do was press down on some strings and strum them. But then I realized that there were so many different chords and scales. And I didn't know where to start. So I decided to take lessons. My teacher was really strict. He would yell at me if I made a mistake. But I learned a lot from him. After a few months, I was able to play a few songs. But I still wasn't very good. So I kept practicing. Every day, I would spend hours practicing. And eventually, I started to get better. I could play faster and cleaner. And I could even improvise. But then I started to feel bored. I wanted to learn something new. So I started to experiment with different styles of music. I tried blues, jazz, rock, and country. And I found that I liked all of them. But then I started to feel lost. I didn't know which style of music to focus on. So I decided to quit taking lessons. I just wanted to have fun. And that's when I started to write my own songs. I wrote songs about everything that was happening in my life. About my friends, my family, my loves, my fears. And I found that writing songs helped me to cope with difficult emotions. But then I started to worry about what other people would think of my songs. Would they be any good? Would anyone even listen to them? So I stopped writing songs for a while. But then I realized that I couldn't stop myself from writing songs. It was just something that I had to do. So I started writing songs again. And I didn't care what other people thought. I just wanted to express myself. And that's when I started to find my voice as a songwriter. And that's why I'm very good at playing the guitar!",
