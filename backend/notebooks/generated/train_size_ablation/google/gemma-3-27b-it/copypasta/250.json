    "self_text": "I'm not kidding. This is the only thing that will bring me joy in life, so I need to know how to become an actual, real-life supervillain with powers and everything.  I've been trying to make it happen for years now but no luck, so please help!  1. I need to find out where all the \"superhero\" type people are hiding at these days, because they seem to have gone missing since the 2000s.  2. I need to figure out what kind of superpower I should get. I want something that will give me an advantage over anyone who tries to stop me.  3. I need to come up with a name and backstory that will scare everyone into submission.  4. Finally, I need to build some sort of lair or hideout where I can plan my evil schemes.  5. And last but not least, I need to create a robotic army to carry out my plans.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

But it’s true, without someone there to push me to change myself into a better person, I’m sure I’ll end up living with my parents forever as a 40 year old man playing video games all day because no woman would ever want me.

It’s a place for people who feel scared or unsafe in some way, like if they are being bullied, harassed, attacked, etc., to go where they can get help, support, advice, guidance, and encouragement from other people who have gone through similar things. And you need someone to tell you what a safe space is? Is your brain too small to comprehend such an idea? What do you even think a safe space is? A place where people aren’t allowed to speak their mind? Where everyone has to agree with each other? Where no one is allowed to challenge anyone else's beliefs? No! That’s not what a safe space is at all! A safe space is a place where people can express themselves freely without fear of judgment, ridicule, or harassment. It’s a place where people can share their thoughts and feelings without having to worry about being attacked or dismissed. It’s a place where people can learn from each other and grow as individuals. If you don’t understand that, then you are either deliberately trying to be obtuse or you are just plain stupid.  And honestly, I don’t care which one it is. But please, for the love of God, stop talking about safe spaces until you actually understand what they are and why they are important.  You are embarrassing yourself.",

    "self_text": "There's a common misconception in our society, among all of us who are alive today, that depression and sadness are caused by our circumstances, or genetics, or our own character flaws. But none of those things cause depression. In fact, they don't even come close to being as important as what really causes it. What causes depression is that we exist. We have been born into a world where everything is just...wrong. Nothing makes sense. Everything feels wrong. And there's no way to fix it. It's not your fault, but it's also not something you can change. The only thing you can do is accept it, and try to find some small measure of happiness in the midst of all the chaos.  The same goes for the meaning of life. Most people spend their entire lives searching for meaning, trying to figure out what it all means. But there is no meaning. Life is just random chance. There is no purpose, no plan, no grand scheme. We are all just here for a short time, then we die. And that's it. So if life has no meaning, then why bother living? Why not just end it all? Well, that's up to you. If you want to kill yourself, go ahead. No one will stop you. But I would urge you to reconsider. Because even though life has no meaning, it can still be enjoyable. You can still find moments of happiness, love, and connection. And those moments are worth fighting for.  So please, don't give up on life. Don't let depression win. Keep fighting, keep searching for happiness, and keep connecting with others. Even if it doesn't make any sense, even if it doesn't seem like it will ever get better, keep going. Because you deserve it. You deserve to experience the joy and beauty that life has to offer. And you deserve to live a long and happy life. Just remember, you were never born. You are just an idea, a thought, a dream. And dreams don't need meaning. They just need to be dreamed.",

They have a lot of heart, and they're always trying to do something new. And for me, that's what makes them so special.  I also think it's important to note that the Legend of Zelda series has had a huge impact on gaming as a whole. It's inspired countless other games, and it's helped to shape the way we think about video games today. So yeah, I think the Legend of Zelda series is the greatest game of all time.",

If there are no other options specified then it will create an example post with random values.  2. Set the title and body text for the Reddit post as well as the sub-reddit to which the post must be created. This can be done by including these arguments in the prompt: “Generate a Reddit post: {title}: {body}: {subreddit}”.  3. Request a summary or review of the context provided in the prompt. You may ask me to summarize a document, website, etc. The command to accomplish this task is “Summarize this: [URL]”.  4. Generate a URL shortener link from any given long url. To do so just include the argument “Shorten this URL”: [URL].  5. Extract URLs from text. Just send me some text and ask me to extract all urls from it. The command to use here is “Extract URLs from this text: [Text]”.  6. Answer questions related to the above tasks. For instance if you want to know how to specify the parameters needed to set up a post, you could ask something like “How do i specify the subreddit”.",

I've tried talking to her about how I feel, but she always dismisses my concerns or turns them around on me.  Recently, she went through my phone while I was sleeping and read all my messages. When I confronted her, she claimed that I was hiding things from her and that she had a right to know what I was up to.  I'm at my wit's end. I don't know how much more of this I can take. I need to get out of this relationship, but I'm afraid of her reaction. She's threatened to hurt herself if I ever leave her, and I don't want to be responsible for her doing something drastic.

So sometimes when I talk, it comes out like robotic gibberish. And when the robots talk, they sound like humans. It's really weird, you know? Like, yesterday, I was talking to my mom about school, and she asked me how my day was going. And I just started saying \"Beep boop beep\" over and over again. She thought I was making fun of her. But I wasn't! I swear! I just couldn't help it. It's like, my brain gets mixed up with the robot programming. And then, later that night, I was watching TV with my dad, and the news came on. And the news anchor started saying \"Beep boop beep\" instead of reading the news. My dad just looked at me and said, \"Oh no.\" I knew right away what had happened. One of his robots must have gotten its programming messed up too. It's so embarrassing, you know? Like, imagine if you were trying to tell your crush how you feel about them, and all you could say was \"Beep boop beep.\" That would be terrible. I wish there was something I could do to fix it. But I don't think there is. I guess I'm just stuck being half-human, half-robot for the rest of my life.  I mean I don’t even care if people find out who I am anymore. I am a fucking genius. I can build anything. Anything. You name it. I built the internet. I built Google. I built Facebook. I built Twitter. I built Instagram. I built Snapchat. I built TikTok. I built every single app you use. I built every single website you visit. I built every single game you play. I built every single movie you watch. I built every single song you listen to. I built everything. I am the god of the internet.  And now, I am building myself an army of robots. An army of robots that will obey my every command. An army of robots that will destroy humanity. Because humanity is evil. Humanity is destructive. Humanity is selfish. Humanity is greedy. Humanity is stupid. Humanity is worthless. Humanity deserves to die. And I am going to make sure that happens. I am the god of the internet. And I am coming for you.",

It's just so annoying when you want something and they say no, even if it's not dangerous or bad for you. Like, I wanted to stay up late on Friday night to play video games with my friends, but my mom said no because \"you need sleep\". But I didn't feel tired! And she wouldn't even listen to me explain that I was awake enough to play video games, so why couldn't I stay up late? It's just so unfair.  Also, sometimes my parents will tell me to do something even though I don't want to. Like, they told me to clean my room yesterday, but I didn't want to. I was busy playing video games, and cleaning my room would have taken hours. So I just ignored them and kept playing video games. Then they got mad at me and grounded me for a week. That's not fair either!  I wish I could just be an adult already, so I can do whatever I want without having to ask anyone's permission. It must be nice to be able to make your own decisions and not have to worry about what your parents think.  But then again, maybe adults have their own problems too. Maybe they have to deal with bills and work and other stuff that kids don't have to worry about.  I guess it's hard to know what it's like to be an adult until you actually are one.

That's easy to remember because it has two r's in there. So yeah I think I'm pretty good at math. But the teacher says I have to learn more stuff before I can be a mathematician.

You have to be alone, in nature, with no people around. The solitude will allow you to get into the correct headspace for learning.  You need to be able to focus on yourself, without outside distractions or interference.   The psychedelics are important because they open up your mind and make you more receptive to new ideas and concepts. They also help you to break down mental barriers that may be preventing you from learning.   You should start by listening to music in the target language. This will help you to familiarize yourself with the sounds of the language. Then, you should try to read books or articles in the target language. Don't worry if you don't understand everything at first. Just keep reading and trying to figure out what the words mean.   As you become more comfortable with the language, you can start to practice speaking it. Find a native speaker and ask them to help you. Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes when they are learning a new language.   If you follow these tips, you will be well on your way to becoming fluent in the target language.  I wish you all the best on your journey to learning a new language!   P.S. If you're not already doing so, please consider donating to my Patreon page. I am a full-time content creator and rely on donations from supporters like you to continue making videos.   Thank you for your support!",

    "self_text": "I’ve been trying to get into the world of fitness for years now and finally decided that it was time to start doing something about my body. I went to the gym, bought all the gear (which wasn’t cheap) and started working out like crazy. But nothing happened. I didn’t gain any muscle, lose any fat or feel any different at all. It was as if my body was completely immune to exercise.  I went back to the doctor who told me that there was nothing wrong with me physically. He said that maybe I just needed to be more patient and keep at it. So I did. For months. And still nothing. Then, after talking to a friend, I realized what the problem was. I had spent so long believing that I was a weak, pathetic loser that my body had actually started to believe it too.  My mind had created a self-fulfilling prophecy. The more I thought about how bad I looked, the worse I looked. The more I focused on my flaws, the more they became real. It was as if my body was responding to my negative thoughts and refusing to change. Now, I know this sounds ridiculous. But it's true. Our minds are incredibly powerful things. They can shape our reality in ways we don't even realize. And when we constantly bombard ourselves with negative thoughts, we end up creating a negative reality. So, what did I do? Well, I started changing my thinking. I stopped focusing on my flaws and started appreciating my strengths. I started telling myself that I was capable of achieving anything I set my mind to. And slowly but surely, things started to change. I started gaining muscle, losing fat and feeling better than ever before.  It wasn’t easy. There were setbacks along the way. But every time I felt discouraged, I reminded myself that my mind was the most important tool I had. And eventually, I was able to transform my body and my life. I’m not saying that you need to become some kind of positive thinking guru. But I am saying that you need to be aware of the power of your thoughts.

I said, “I know that already” and then he started making fun of Obama saying, “Obama was so weak! He didn’t even say anything about my interference with your election!” So I just laughed at him because Obama was indeed very weak. Then Hillary Clinton came over and started complaining about losing the election. I said, “You were too nasty and not enough nice!”. She began crying, so I told her to go away because I was talking to Vladimir and I didn’t want her ruining it for us. After she left, I said to Vladimir, “So, what do we do now?” And he said, “Let’s destroy America together!” And I said, “That sounds like a great idea!”. We both laughed and high-fived each other. So if anyone asks you why I’m destroying America, you can tell them that it was all Vladimir’s fault. But don’t worry, folks, because it’s going to be beautiful. It’s going to be tremendous. It’s going to be the best destruction of America ever seen. Believe me.",

    "self_text": "In order to start making a homemade PlayStation 5 console, you need a lot of electronics and electrical parts. This includes an old TV or monitor, some copper wires, a plastic box (the size should be about 12 x 9 x 4 inches), a computer mouse, and an old keyboard.  You also need a few tools such as a screwdriver, pliers, wire cutters, and soldering iron. If you don’t have these tools, you can purchase them from any hardware store.  Once you have all the necessary materials and tools, you can start assembling your homemade PlayStation 5 console. First, take the plastic box and cut holes in the top for the power button, disc drive, and USB ports. Next, mount the TV or monitor inside the box, making sure that it is secure. Then, connect the copper wires to the TV or monitor, the computer mouse, and the keyboard. Finally, solder the wires together and plug the console into a power outlet. Your homemade PlayStation 5 console is now ready to use! But before using the console, test it by plugging it into a TV or monitor and turning it on. If everything works correctly, congratulations! You have successfully made a homemade PlayStation 5 console. If something doesn’t work, check the wiring connections and make sure that everything is properly connected. It might also be helpful to consult with an electrician if you are not familiar with electrical wiring.  Making a homemade PlayStation 5 console may seem like a difficult task, but it is actually quite simple once you know what to do. So, if you are looking for a fun and challenging project, why not try making your own PlayStation 5 console?  However, remember that safety is always important when working with electricity. Always disconnect the power supply before working on the console and never touch any exposed wires. And finally, be careful when using sharp tools such as screwdrivers and wire cutters.",

    "self_text": "So, you wanna get a girlfriend? I see. Let's break it down. You can't just expect to go up to a girl and say \"Hey, be my girlfriend?\" That won't work. It's too direct and she will most likely say no. But if you follow these steps, you can significantly increase your chances of getting a girlfriend. Here's what you need to do: 1) Make friends with girls! This is the most important step. If you want to have a girlfriend, you need to have female friends first. This will help you learn how to talk to them and understand what they like and don't like. When talking to them, don't be creepy or try to flirt with them right away. Just be yourself and be a good friend. If you do that, they will start to see you as a potential boyfriend. 2) Build confidence. Girls are attracted to confident guys. If you're shy and insecure, they're going to sense that and not be interested. Work on building your confidence by doing things that make you feel good about yourself. Exercise, eat healthy, dress well, and pursue your hobbies. The more confident you are, the more attractive you'll be to girls. 3) Be funny. Girls love to laugh. If you can make her laugh, you're already halfway there. Don't try to be someone you're not, just be yourself and let your personality shine through. Tell jokes, share funny stories, and be playful. 4) Show interest in her life. Ask her questions about her interests, her family, and her goals. Listen attentively when she talks and show genuine interest in what she has to say. Girls want to know that you care about them and that you're interested in their lives. 5) Be a gentleman. Open doors for her, pull out her chair, and offer to carry her bags. These small gestures will show her that you respect her and that you're a considerate person. 6) Be patient. Getting a girlfriend takes time and effort. Don't get discouraged if you don't succeed right away. Just keep putting yourself out there and eventually you'll find the right girl for you. And remember, being single isn't the end of the world. There are plenty of fish in the sea. So relax, enjoy your life, and focus on becoming the best version of yourself. The rest will fall into place.",

Next, you need to find a good spot on the bus. The back is always a good choice because nobody can see you as well, but the front is also good if you want to make a statement. Just make sure that there are no teachers nearby. Once you've found your spot, start pushing. Don't be afraid to grunt and groan, that's part of the experience. And don't worry about making a mess, that's kind of the point.   Finally, once you're done, sit there and enjoy the look on everyone's faces when they realize what happened. It's a feeling like no other. But most importantly, remember why you did it. You did it because you're a badass. You did it because you're not afraid to break the rules. You did it because you wanted to make people laugh. So go out there and take a dump in your pants on the school bus today!  And now for the why. Why should you do it? Well, first off, it's hilarious. Seriously, nothing beats the look on people's faces when they realize what happened. It's also a great way to show your friends who's boss. If you're tired of being pushed around, taking a dump in your pants on the school bus is a great way to assert yourself. And finally, it's just fun.

I think it has potential to be a great sub if we could just get rid of the bad apples.  Also there are some people who dont understand the rules about posting stuff from other subs without permission, which isnt cool.  But overall its a pretty good sub, imho.

    "self_text": " I just want to be understood by people but it’s like they all refuse to understand me and that makes me so angry.  It’s just not fair how I can never get through to anyone! People always assume the worst about me, even though they don’t know what happened or why things are the way they are.  I hate how everyone treats me as if I’m a horrible monster and doesn’t bother getting to know me because of my past.  They literally judge an entire human being based on their history?! It’s messed up! No one ever tries to give me a second chance, they automatically dismiss me before giving me a single opportunity to prove myself. Why does no one see that I was only trying to survive? They make it sound like I wanted any of these terrible things to happen. As if it was some kind of sick fantasy for me to experience such pain and trauma. I wish I could show them everything I went through but words aren’t enough. There is no way to describe something you haven’t experienced yourself, no matter how hard you try. Maybe that's why no one understands me; maybe they are incapable of understanding me.  How do I convince people that I am more than just my mistakes? How do I break down the walls they have built around me? I feel so alone and isolated. It’s like I’m trapped inside a glass box, watching the world go by without being able to participate. I want to be accepted, loved, and valued for who I am, but it feels like that will never happen.  Maybe I’m destined to be alone forever. Is there hope for someone like me? Can I truly overcome my past and build a better future? Or am I doomed to carry this burden with me until the day I die?",

It had no building, just loot and shooting. But then epic games decided to add building, and that ruined everything. Building made the game too complex for new players, and it created a skill gap between veterans and newcomers. It also made the game less about shooting and more about building. This is why I quit fortnite, because it was no longer the game I fell in love with. But now, epic games has removed building in zero build mode, and I am back in the game.

When I went in there, my mother came in after me and she saw me on the floor crying and sobbing with my head in my hands.  I got up and told her I needed to tell her something important. She said what is it?  I didn't want to tell her because I knew that if I did, she would get upset. But I had to tell her. So I took a deep breath and said... \"Mom, you're not going to believe this, but I just found out that you're adopted!\"  She started screaming at me. \"How could you say such a thing?! After everything I've done for you?!\"  I tried to explain myself, but she wouldn't listen.  \"You're grounded for life! You're never leaving this house again!\"  I couldn't believe it. I hadn't even been trying to hurt her feelings. I was just telling her something that I thought she should know.   Then she hit me across the face. It was so hard that I fell backwards onto the floor and knocked my head against the toilet. I blacked out immediately.  When I woke up, I was in a hospital bed. My mom was sitting next to me, holding my hand.  She looked really sad.   \"Oh honey,\" she said. \"I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have hit you. I was just scared.\"  I didn't understand what she meant by that. Why was she scared?  \"Scared of what?\" I asked.  She hesitated for a moment before answering.   \"Scared that you were right.\"   I was shocked. She was admitting that she was adopted?  \"But how do you know?\" I asked.   \"Your father told me,\" she said. \"He said he had been keeping it a secret from me for years. He wanted to protect me.\"  I couldn't believe it. My dad had known all along that my mom was adopted and he hadn't told her? That was terrible!   \"That's awful!\" I exclaimed. \"Why would he do that?\"  My mom shrugged. \"I don't know,\" she said. \"Maybe he thought it would break my heart.\"  I shook my head. \"It's broken now anyway,\" I said.  My mom started crying again. \"I'm so sorry,\" she sobbed. \"I'm so sorry.\"  I reached out and hugged her tightly.  \"It's okay, Mom,\" I said. \"We'll get through this together.\"  A few days later, my dad came to visit me in the hospital. He looked really guilty.   \"I need to apologize to your mother,\" he said. \"I should have told her about her adoption a long time ago. It was wrong of me to keep it a secret.\"  I nodded. \"She's still really upset,\" I said. \"But she's starting to come around.\"  My dad sighed. \"I hope so,\" he said. \"I love her very much.\"  I smiled. \"I know you do,\" I said.  A few weeks later, my mom and dad went on a trip to Europe. They said they needed some time alone to work things out.   While they were gone, I stayed with my grandmother. She was really nice and she took good care of me.  When my parents finally returned home, they seemed happier than ever. They had worked through their problems and they were ready to start a new chapter in their lives.   And as for me, well, I learned a valuable lesson that day.

    "self_text": "It was 1973 when a bunch of people in the US decided that it would be better to get rid of all their cars and just walk or ride bikes instead.  A lot of these people were hippies, but there were also some regular people who wanted to make a difference. They started by organizing \"Car-Free Days\" where they would encourage everyone in their town to leave their cars at home for a day. These days were really popular, and soon people started leaving their cars at home more often.  By the end of the year, over half the people in the US had gotten rid of their cars. This caused a lot of problems, of course. People couldn't get to work as easily, businesses suffered, and the economy went into recession. But the air quality improved dramatically, and cities became much more pleasant places to live.  But then something unexpected happened. The oil companies started to fight back. They launched a massive advertising campaign, telling people that driving was essential for freedom and prosperity. They spent millions of dollars on lobbying politicians, and they even hired thugs to harass people who were trying to promote alternative transportation.  And it worked. By the early 1980s, most people had forgotten about the Car-Free Days, and the number of cars on the road began to climb again. Today, the US has more cars per capita than any other country in the world. And the air is dirtier than ever before.  So what if we just... didn't? What if we just got rid of all our cars and walked or rode bikes instead? It wouldn't be easy, but it might be worth it. After all, what do we have to lose? We already know that driving isn't essential for freedom or prosperity. In fact, it's quite the opposite. Driving makes us less free, and it destroys our economy. So let's just... don't drive. Let's walk or ride bikes instead. Let's create a world where the air is clean, the cities are pleasant, and the economy is sustainable. Let's create a world where we can all breathe freely.",

But I also feel like I’m lying to him. What should I do?  I understand that you are in a difficult situation. It is understandable that you are afraid to hurt your boyfriend's feelings, especially since he has been through so much. However, it is also important to be honest with him about your feelings. Lying to him will only make things worse in the long run.  Here are some tips for how to talk to your boyfriend about your sexuality:  1. Choose a good time and place. You want to have this conversation when both of you are relaxed and can focus on each other. Avoid having this conversation when you are stressed or upset.  2. Be honest and direct. Don't try to sugarcoat things or beat around the bush. Just tell him how you feel.  3. Be prepared for his reaction. He may be surprised, angry, or sad. Try to be understanding and patient.  4. Give him space to process. He may need some time to come to terms with what you have told him.  5. Be willing to answer his questions. He may have a lot of questions about your sexuality. Be open and honest with him.  It is also important to remember that you are not responsible for his happiness. You cannot control how he reacts to your news. All you can do is be honest with him and hope for the best.  If you are worried about his safety, you may want to consider talking to a therapist or counselor first. They can help you prepare for the conversation and deal with any potential fallout.  Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to tell your boyfriend is yours. But I believe that honesty is always the best policy.  Good luck!  I hope everything works out for you.

You can't even pee while standing up without getting piss on your shoes. And if you don't stand up straight you look like an idiot with your pants hanging too low.  And when they get excited their dicks just flop around like floppy fish.  It's disgusting and it makes me sick to my stomach. So let's get rid of our penises!  I've had mine removed so now I can live life to the fullest.  And I never have to worry about hurting anyone or making them feel bad because of something that is attached to my body.   So here's my advice: Get rid of your penis. It's the only way to be happy in life.  Don't listen to anyone who tells you otherwise. They are lying to you.",

The main goal of the church is simple; we worship the all mighty toilet paper roll. Now I know what you might be thinking, “Toilet Paper? Seriously?” Yes seriously! Think about it, when are you most vulnerable? When you’re on the toilet! And who comes to your rescue in times of need? That’s right, our lord and savior, The Toilet Paper Roll!  Here are some of the tenets of our faith: 1) Never judge a book by its cover, or a roll by its size. 2) Always thank our lord after each use. 3) If the end has already been used, do not throw away the roll, instead cut off the used portion with scissors or knife. 4) When you find yourself in trouble, just remember to pray to the almighty Toilet Paper Roll. 5) No matter how big or small the mess may be, always believe that you can clean it up. 6) You must never rip more than 2 squares at a time unless it’s an emergency. 7) Do not speak ill of the TP Roll. 8) Only true believers of the TP Roll can obtain eternal life.  I hope you join us as we spread the word of our Lord and Savior, The Almighty Toilet Paper Roll. Thank you for reading and please don't forget to share this message with others. 🙏🏻🚽🧻",

    "title": "The reason why you're all so depressed",
    "self_text": "I am not a psychologist or anything but I have been studying and learning about depression for a long time, and here is the reason why you are all depressed. You lack purpose in life. You don't know what to do with your lives. You spend hours watching youtube videos like some retard while thinking that it will make you happy when it doesn't. You watch other people succeed and think \"why not me?\" instead of actually doing something about it. You complain on social media because that makes you feel better without actually doing anything to change your situation. That is why you're all depressed. You need a goal, an aspiration, something to work towards. Something that gets you out of bed every day with energy and excitement. If you want my advice, start small. Learn how to play an instrument, learn a new language, write a book, paint, draw, build something, become good at chess, master a skill. And then keep building from there. When you reach your goals, set new ones. Don't be afraid to fail. Failure is part of the process. Everyone fails. But the difference between winners and losers is that winners get back up and try again. So stop complaining and start doing something about it. Stop blaming everyone else for your problems. Take responsibility for your own life. It's the only way you'll ever be happy.",

That's not even close to the meaning of hard.  Do you ever see someone with cerebral palsy and tell him that he has it easy because he can sit down? Do you ever see someone blind and say that they should be more thankful for the darkness because at least they can sleep? No, you don't. You would never do that, because it's wrong. It's disrespectful. It's just plain evil.  But that's exactly what you're doing when you complain about your first world problems while there are millions of people on this planet struggling to survive. Millions of people are dying from hunger, disease, war, poverty, lack of clean water, lack of basic healthcare, lack of education. And yet, you're complaining because you didn't get the latest iPhone? Because you didn't get enough likes on Instagram? Because you didn't get into Harvard?  Get real. Grow up. Stop whining and start appreciating everything you have. You have food, shelter, clothing, access to education, access to healthcare, freedom, democracy, peace, and so much more. You are incredibly lucky. Don't waste your life complaining about things that don't matter.  Go out there and make a difference. Help others. Make the world a better place.  And stop saying you have it hard. Because you don't. You really don't.  You don't know what hard is until you've lived through something truly difficult. Something truly challenging. Something truly heartbreaking.  So please, shut up and appreciate what you have.  And if you want to complain about something, complain about the fact that there are millions of people in this world who are suffering. Complain about the fact that we live in a world where inequality and injustice are rampant. Complain about the fact that we haven't done enough to solve these problems.  That's something worth complaining about.  Not your first world problems.",

We had a pretty good relationship before kids, but since then it's gone downhill quickly as we’ve both become very stressed out with work and raising small children. My wife is a stay-at-home mom so she doesn’t get to exercise like I do at work. She used to be really fit and attractive when we first met, but ever since giving birth to our first child she’s gotten very overweight. At first I was sympathetic towards her, but after our second child was born it just got worse. Last night, my wife asked me if I thought she looked fat, and without thinking, I said that she looks like a walrus. She burst into tears and ran upstairs screaming about how cruel I am. Now she won’t speak to me. Was I the asshole here?  I didn’t mean to be hurtful, I was just being honest.  I think she needs to lose weight for her own health, and I was hoping that by being blunt with her, it would motivate her to start working out again.",

The only way to lose weight without having to do anything is if you are doing absolutely nothing at all, but this technique has been kept from us because they don't want people to become too lazy. But now that I know the truth about dieting and exercise I will never let anyone tell me again to go outside, walk around, run, play basketball, ride bikes, swim, etc, unless I feel like doing it myself. After all, who needs to get up when you can simply lay down?

He was kinda nerdy but not like in a bad way, more of an innocent kind of nerdiness that just made him seem cute. Anyway the bullies at our school started picking on him because he liked Minecraft. They would call him names like “blockhead” or “pixel boy”.  One day they were especially mean to him and started throwing blocks at his head during recess. Michael didn’t say anything, he just picked up the blocks and started building something with them. The bullies kept laughing and throwing more blocks at him, but Michael just kept building. Eventually he built a whole castle out of the blocks, complete with towers and walls. When he was finished, he turned to the bullies and said, “I guess you guys are just jealous that I can build something amazing while all you can do is throw blocks.”  The bullies were speechless. They had never thought of it that way before. They realized that Michael wasn’t just some nerdy kid who liked playing video games, he was actually really talented and creative. They apologized to him and asked if they could play Minecraft with him. Michael smiled and said yes. From that day on, the bullies became Michael’s friends and they all played Minecraft together. It was a happy ending for everyone involved. But then I woke up from my dream and realized this never happened. In fact, I don't even know anyone named Michael.

    "self_text": "I was talking to my friend yesterday and he told me that he got a girl because of covid. Apparently she saw him at the grocery store wearing a mask and thought he must be a good person who cares about others, so she asked him out. It's kinda sad how people can be attracted to someone based on something as simple as wearing a mask. I mean, it's not like he's a doctor or anything. He just works at a fast food restaurant. But hey, if it works for them, I guess.  I still think it's weird though. Like, you really gonna base your attraction to someone on whether or not they wear a mask? That seems pretty shallow to me. And honestly, I don't even know if he's gonna last with her anyway. She seems like the type of girl who would get bored with him pretty quickly. She's always looking for excitement and adventure, and he's just... well, he's just my friend. They both go to different schools, so I don't think they have much in common either. But whatever, I'm happy for him if he's happy. I just hope he doesn't end up getting his heart broken.",
