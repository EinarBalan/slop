(music) Oh, I'm gonna get on my knees and beg you to be mine, babe.   I will do anything for you.  Anything at all.   I would even kill someone if you wanted me to, baby.  Oh, I'll die for you, baby.  I really mean it.   I love you more than words can say.  You are my everything.  Without you, I am nothing.  I want to spend every waking moment of my life with you.   I wanna hold your hand when we walk down the street.  I wanna kiss you under the stars.  I wanna wake up next to you every morning and go to sleep next to you every night.   I wanna spend our lives together.  I wanna grow old with you.   I wanna watch our grandchildren play in the park.  I wanna share everything with you.   I wanna tell you how much I love you every day of my life.  I wanna make you happy every day of my life.   I wanna give you everything you ever wanted.   I wanna fulfill all of your dreams.  I wanna be the man of your dreams.   I wanna be your hero.  I wanna be your savior.  I wanna be your protector.  I wanna be your lover.  I wanna be your friend.   I wanna be everything to you.  I want to be the best husband in the world.  I want to be the most loving father in the world.   I want to be the most successful businessman in the world.  I wanna be the most powerful man in the world.   But none of that matters without you.  You are the only thing that matters to me.  I would trade it all away just to be with you.   So please, baby, say you'll be mine.  Say you'll spend the rest of your life with me.  Say you'll marry me.  Say you'll let me love you forever.  Please, baby, don't leave me.   Don't break my heart.  I can't live without you.   I need you.   I crave you.  I desire you.   I lust after you.   I yearn for you.   I worship you.   I adore you.   I idolize you.

I'm so tired of being alone, I don't know what to do anymore. I don't even know how to get a girlfriend, it's so hard when you're shy and awkward.

I'm so lonely and depressed, I can't even enjoy my hobbies anymore because all I can think about is how much I want a girlfriend. I've tried everything, dating apps, speed dating, joining clubs, but nothing seems to work. I'm starting to think that maybe I'm just not meant to be loved. I guess I'll just have to accept my fate and live a solitary life. But it's so hard, I just want to hold someone close and feel their warmth. I want to share my life with someone, laugh together, cry together, and grow old together. Is that too much to ask? I don't understand why this is happening to me. I'm a good person, I'm kind, intelligent, and funny. I have a lot to offer, but nobody seems to notice. I'm starting to feel invisible, like I don't even exist. I'm losing my mind, I can't take this anymore. I need help, I need guidance, I need a miracle. Please, someone, anyone, tell me what I'm doing wrong. I'm desperate, I'm willing to try anything.

Who are we to question their authority? We are only citizens! They know better than us! It's not like they're going to screw things up for their own personal gain or anything...  Are we really gonna let these corrupt politicians run our lives forever?  No!  We must take back control of our planet.  But how?  That’s where I come in.  I have a plan.  A plan so simple yet so brilliant that it will make you question everything you thought you knew about climate change.  My plan involves… (drumroll please)…   Nuclear power plants. Yes, you heard me right. Nuclear power plants. We need more nuclear power plants. Lots of them. Everywhere. We should build them on top of mountains, under the ocean, even inside volcanoes.  It doesn’t matter where we put them. As long as they produce electricity, we’re good.  Sure, there might be some risks involved. But those risks are minimal compared to the risk of doing nothing. And besides, we can always cover up any accidents with propaganda and misinformation.  And don’t worry about the radioactive waste. We can just dump it into the ocean. No one will ever notice. Or maybe we can shoot it into space. That sounds fun.  So what do you say? Are you with me? Let’s save the world together. With nuclear power plants.  What could possibly go wrong?  P.S. Don't forget to subscribe to my YouTube channel for more brilliant ideas. Link in description below.",

I didn't know what to say, so I said \"sorry\".  She laughed and said \"it's okay\" and then asked if I wanted to switch positions.  I said sure and we switched, so now I'm penetrating her from behind.  This is way easier because there's nothing blocking my penis, so I can just push it in as much as I want.  It feels good, but I still feel bad for not being able to penetrate her normally.  Afterwards, she thanked me for trying and said that she really enjoyed it.  I was relieved to hear that, but I still felt like I failed somehow.  I don't think I'll ever be able to penetrate a transgender woman again.",

His dad used to have a really nice sports car, but he didn't like it much because he had to be careful while driving it and couldn't drive fast. So he decided to buy a truck instead. He liked that he could go as fast as he wanted without worrying about damaging the vehicle, and he was able to haul things around with it. But then one day, while he was driving home from work, he got into an accident. He wasn't hurt, but his truck was totaled. He went to the junkyard to get his stuff out of the truck, and he noticed something strange. There were several people standing around the truck, looking at it. He asked them what they were doing, and they said they were trying to figure out how to get the engine out. He told them that he was the owner of the truck, and they all apologized for snooping around. They explained that they were mechanics who were interested in seeing the engine. They said that the engine was very rare and valuable, and they would pay him a lot of money for it. He agreed to sell them the engine, and they gave him cash on the spot. He took the money and bought himself another truck. This time, he decided to buy a different kind of truck. He bought a pickup truck with a big engine and four-wheel drive. He loved this truck, and he drove it everywhere. One day, while he was driving down the highway, he saw a familiar face. It was one of the mechanics who had bought his engine. He pulled over to say hello, and the mechanic told him that he had just finished rebuilding the engine. He said that it was now even more powerful than it had been before. He offered to let him take it for a spin. He accepted the offer, and he was amazed by the power of the engine. He thanked the mechanic for letting him try it out, and he drove away. As he was driving home, he started to think about everything that had happened. He realized that he had made a mistake by selling the engine. He should have kept it and rebuilt it himself. He also realized that he had learned a valuable lesson. He learned that sometimes, you need to take risks in order to achieve your goals. And he learned that sometimes, the best way to learn is to make mistakes. The next day, he went back to the junkyard and asked if they had any other engines for sale. They did, and he bought one. He spent the next few months rebuilding the engine, and he finally finished it. He put the engine in his truck, and he drove it everywhere. He loved his truck, and he never regretted buying it. The end.",

I’ve been saying this for years and people always scoff at me, but it’s true. If you think you can meet women organically by going out to bars or clubs or whatever, you are delusional.  The truth is, most women don’t want to be approached by strangers anymore. They want to know who they’re dealing with before they even consider giving them the time of day. That’s why online dating is so effective. You have your profile up there, with pictures and a bio, and women can check you out before they decide whether or not they want to talk to you. It takes the guesswork out of things and makes it much easier to connect with someone. And yeah, it might feel weird at first, sending messages to random women on the internet, but trust me, it’s worth it. Because if you don’t do it, you’re just gonna sit around alone forever, wondering what could have been. So go ahead, download Tinder or Bumble and start swiping. What have you got to lose? At least give it a shot.  I’m telling you, it’s the only way to get girls these days.",

What if there had never been any wars or conflicts between them and the West? Or even worse, what if they had won? Would we be living in a world where communism was dominant, and democracy was just a distant memory? How would our lives be different?  I know it sounds like a crazy thought experiment, but sometimes I can't help but wonder about these scenarios. It’s not that I want communism to win, it's just that I am curious about how the world would be different if it did. If there was no World War II, there wouldn’t have been an occupation of Japan, Korea, Germany, Austria, Italy, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Albania, Yugoslavia, Greece, Norway, Denmark, Luxembourg, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Finland, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and many more countries!

They smell, they shed, they poop, they pee everywhere, they get sick and need expensive vet care, they chew up your furniture and your shoes, they bite you when you try to touch them, they wake you up at night with their incessant barking or meowing, they lick themselves in public, they leave hair all over everything, they require constant attention, and they die and then you have to grieve for them like they were people. It’s ridiculous. If you want companionship, get a friend. If you want something to take care of, get a plant. But if you want an animal, go to the zoo.  I think that pets make people stupid. Why would anyone spend so much time and money on an animal? That money could be used for more important things, like education, travel, or investing. And why would anyone let an animal control their life? People who have pets always talk about their pets and how great they are. It’s annoying. They treat their pets like children, dressing them up in clothes, taking them out to eat, and even pushing them in strollers. It’s pathetic.  And what happens when you go on vacation? You have to pay someone to come to your house every day to feed and walk your pet. Or you have to take your pet with you, which is even worse. Imagine trying to find a hotel that allows pets. It’s a nightmare.  I just don’t understand the appeal of having a pet. They’re messy, smelly, and demanding. They’re nothing but trouble. I’m better off without one.  In fact, I hate animals.  They’re dirty, dumb, and dangerous.  I wouldn’t trust one as far as I can throw it.  And I wouldn’t want one anywhere near me.  So please, keep your pets away from me.  I don’t want to catch anything from them.  Or get bitten by them.  Or have to smell them.  Just keep them away from me.  Thank you.",

I looked at the chicken and thought, \"Why not?\" So I grabbed it by the legs and stuffed its head into my mouth. It was still alive and flapping around, but I just kept chewing. It tasted like chicken, but with more feathers. After I finished eating the chicken, I felt really sick. I threw up on the sidewalk and then passed out. When I woke up, I was in a hospital bed.

In fact, studies have shown that spam bots are actually more likely to give up and go away when they are ignored. So next time you encounter a spam bot, don't bother responding.

    "self_text": "So I have a couple of theories about why people are getting that black screen on their Xbox Series X consoles when they turn them on for the first time. My first theory is that it's caused by a bug in the operating system. The OS needs to be updated before you can use the console and if there is a glitch during that process, then the console might get stuck in a boot loop.  The second theory is that the console isn't able to connect to the internet. This could be due to a bad wifi connection or an issue with your network settings. If the console can't connect to the internet, it won't be able to download the necessary updates and will get stuck in a boot loop.  And the third theory is that the console has a hardware defect. This could be anything from a faulty power supply to a broken motherboard. If the console has a hardware defect, it might not be able to boot up properly.  I think the most likely cause of the problem is a bug in the operating system. But it's also possible that the console isn't able to connect to the internet or that it has a hardware defect.  If you're experiencing this problem, try restarting your console several times. If that doesn't work, try resetting your network settings. And if that still doesn't work, contact Microsoft support.",

    "self_text": "I have been following the case of a former child actor, Danny Masterson, who was convicted of rape in May 2023. As many people know, he played Malcolm on That '70s Show. While Masterson's fans and supporters claim that his conviction was politically motivated and based on false accusations by Scientologists, it is important to understand the facts of the case. In November 2022, Masterson's first trial ended with a hung jury after jurors were unable to reach a unanimous verdict. However, in a retrial in May 2023, Masterson was found guilty on two counts of rape for assaulting women he met through the Church of Scientology. He faces up to 45 years in prison. The evidence presented at the trial included testimony from multiple women who accused Masterson of sexual assault, as well as emails and text messages allegedly sent by Masterson himself. Additionally, experts testified about the effects of trauma on memory and the difficulty of recalling details of traumatic events. The prosecution argued that Masterson used his position within the Church of Scientology to intimidate victims into silence and avoid accountability for his actions. Masterson has maintained his innocence throughout both trials and plans to appeal his conviction. However, the overwhelming evidence presented at the second trial suggests that he is guilty of the crimes he was charged with. It is important to note that the allegations against Masterson are serious and disturbing. Sexual assault is a crime that causes significant harm to victims, and it should not be taken lightly. While some may disagree with the outcome of the trial, it is crucial to respect the legal process and the decisions made by the jury. The case of Danny Masterson serves as a reminder that even those who appear to be successful and beloved can be capable of committing terrible acts. It also highlights the importance of holding perpetrators of sexual assault accountable for their actions.",

    "self_text": "I’m just going to come out and say it… the fitness industry is full of shit. It doesn’t want you to get results, because if you do, they lose money. They want you to buy their products, their programs, their meal plans, their supplements, their gym memberships, and all the other stuff that will make them rich while you stay fat and miserable.  But what if I told you there was a way to get in shape without having to work hard? What if I told you there was a way to build muscle, lose fat, and feel great without spending hours at the gym or eating bland, tasteless food? Well, there is. And it’s called biohacking. Biohacking is simply using science and technology to improve your body and mind. It’s about understanding how your body works and then finding ways to optimize it.  Here are some things you can do to start biohacking your body today:  1. Sleep more. This is the most important thing you can do for your health. When you sleep, your body repairs itself and builds muscle. If you don’t get enough sleep, you’ll be tired, stressed, and less able to focus.  2. Eat healthy foods. This should be obvious, but it’s worth repeating. Eating processed foods, sugar, and unhealthy fats will sabotage your efforts to get in shape. Instead, focus on eating whole, unprocessed foods like fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and healthy fats.  3. Exercise regularly. You don’t need to spend hours at the gym to get fit. Just 30 minutes of moderate exercise each day can make a big difference.  4. Take supplements. There are many supplements that can help you improve your health and performance. Some good options include creatine, whey protein, and vitamin D.  5. Use technology. There are many technologies available that can help you track your progress and optimize your health. Some examples include fitness trackers, sleep monitors, and brainwave sensors.  Biohacking isn’t just about getting in shape. It’s about taking control of your health and well-being. It’s about optimizing your body and mind so you can live your best life.  If you’re ready to take control of your health, I encourage you to learn more about biohacking. There are many resources available online and in libraries.  And remember, the key to success is to start small and be consistent. Don’t try to change everything overnight. Just pick one or two things to focus on and gradually add more over time.  You’ll be surprised at how much better you feel when you start taking care of yourself.",

I want you to tell me about your life.\" The boy frowned. \"My life? What does that even mean?\" \"Your experiences! Your feelings!\" I exclaimed, trying to be encouraging. The boy paused for a moment, then spoke slowly, \"But I don't have any feelings. I'm just a robot.\" My jaw dropped. \"A robot?! You're telling me you're a robot?!\" \"Yes,\" the boy replied matter-of-factly. \"I was created by Dr. Wily to destroy Mega Man.\" I stared at him in disbelief. \"Dr. Wily? Mega Man? Are you kidding me?\" The boy shook his head. \"No. It's true. I am Proto Man, the evil brother of Mega Man.\" I sighed. This was going to be harder than I thought. \"Okay, okay,\" I said, trying to regain my composure. \"Let's start with something simple. What do you like to do for fun?\" The boy tilted his head. \"Fun? What is 'fun'?\" I groaned. This was going nowhere. \"Never mind,\" I said. \"Just tell me about your powers.\" The boy smiled. \"Oh, I have lots of powers. I can shoot lasers from my eyes, fly through the air, and teleport anywhere in the world.\" I raised an eyebrow. \"Teleport anywhere in the world?\" \"Yes,\" the boy replied proudly. \"I can even teleport to other dimensions.\" I blinked. \"Other dimensions?\" \"Yes,\" the boy said. \"I once teleported to a dimension where everyone was made of cheese.\" I burst out laughing. \"Cheese?! That's ridiculous!\" The boy shrugged. \"It was a very cheesy dimension.\" I couldn't stop laughing. This was the most absurd conversation I had ever had.

War games are fun but they don't prepare you for the horrors of a real battlefield. They also give false confidence and encourage recklessness. I think that if the US had been more serious about its training, then it would have won both Iraq and Afghanistan.  War games are a waste of time and money. They don't teach soldiers anything useful. They just make them feel good about themselves.  I think that the US military should stop wasting time and money on war games and start focusing on real-world training. If we want to win our wars, we need to train like we fight. That means getting out there and fighting! I am a veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. I saw firsthand how unprepared our troops were for the realities of combat. It was a disaster.  We lost so many lives because our soldiers didn't know what they were doing. We need to do better.
