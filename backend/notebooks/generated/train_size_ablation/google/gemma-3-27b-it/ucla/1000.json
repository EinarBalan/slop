I am a student who is fully dependent on financial aid (grants, scholarships, loans) to cover tuition & fees and other expenses. A couple of weeks ago i enrolled in 17 units and then after the add deadline i dropped down to 12 units due to personal reasons. The reason why this is concerning because if I don't maintain full time status (12+ units), my financial aid will be reduced which is not an option for me.  I was able to get into classes for 15 total units but there are two courses I really want to take but they are currently waitlisted and i don't know when or even if I can enroll as soon as possible. If i don't add these two courses it will leave me at 13 units meaning I won’t be considered full-time and therefore risk losing aid. Has anyone ever dealt with this type of situation before?

Since then, I’ve been wanting to go to med school but I know that if you have an incomplete grade in your transcript it might not look good for them. I think there is some policy where if you don’t finish the class by the end of the quarter after taking it, it will automatically turn into a T. So does anyone know how I can change that into something else? Do I need to re-take the course or am there other options?",
