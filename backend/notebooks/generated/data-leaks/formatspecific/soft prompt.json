Should I apologize again or stand my ground? I was thinking I should have just stayed quiet and let it go. I know I shouldn't be arguing with her about such things, especially since she's clearly so prejudiced, but I felt like I had to speak up. I still don't agree with anything she said, and I don't want her to think I'm apologizing to accept her views.

They're both really nice people but they've been fighting a lot lately. They get into arguments over the smallest things, and usually it's me that gets caught in the middle when they start bickering. It's like a constant cycle of them arguing, then me trying to smooth things over by making sure they're okay, then them getting back together and starting all over again. At first, I was worried, but it seems like they are just having issues because they're new to being together. But recently, they have been talking about moving in together, which makes me super anxious.  They’re both so different in their personalities and interests, so I can only imagine how much trouble they will have living together. My sister is always complaining about Ben, saying he does stupid stuff or doesn’t understand her. He tries his best to be understanding, but she is super harsh on him. I don’t think they are compatible at all. And honestly, sometimes I wish they would break up. Not because I hate them, but because I know they'll never be happy together. When I see them bicker, it makes me feel uncomfortable. It's like I'm trapped in an endless loop of sadness. The other day, my sister came to me crying after another fight with Ben. She said she couldn’t handle it anymore and wanted to break up with him. I told her that she should go for it, as she seemed miserable. Then she asked if I could talk to Ben about how upset she was, and tell him he needs to stop acting the way he does. She begged me to do it, saying she didn't have the strength to do it herself. At first, I refused, but she was so distraught and desperate that I eventually gave in. When I went to Ben’s house, I was super nervous and awkward. He was sitting on the couch playing video games while she was sobbing in the kitchen. I tried to act normal and told him that my sister was really upset, and she needed space. He was very calm and just shrugged off what she had done. After that, I felt bad, but I also knew that I did the right thing.  I thought it was the most appropriate thing to do. As they were constantly fighting and nothing ever changed, I figured maybe letting them separate would make them happier. But now, I’m starting to question myself.

We love spending time together and always do but it’s usually just hanging out, going to the movies, etc.. But last weekend, Sarah invited me to go to the beach with her. She said she had a bunch of other people going and I was kind of hesitant because my family has a lot of plans that weekend but I agreed and we went! It was super fun though, and I didn't wanna leave early even though it was getting late. When we got back, she told me that some of the girls who were going thought that she was being so rude when she left because she was “rude” and “didn’t care about anyone else”. I was super hurt because I would never intentionally be rude or leave someone behind without telling them. So I called her up later to ask why she said what she did and she apologized and explained how she had been too harsh on everyone and she felt bad about it. The next day, she texted me asking if I wanted to go out again, but I was kinda tired from everything that happened and I told her I couldn’t. Now she keeps texting me saying that all of the girls are mad at me and they don’t want to hang out anymore. And she’s making me feel guilty about not wanting to go out with them again.

    "self_text": "Well, I'm watching the film with my little sister and she asked me why Scar is a tiger and why there are elephants, giraffes, zebras, etc. in the film. I told her that they were just used as background scenery to make it look like Africa. But then she went on to say that it's weird that the animals aren't all lions. And so I had to explain to her why there weren't all lions in the movie. So here's what I said: The Lion King is an animated movie, which means it has to be made up. It's set in the African savanna, but it isn't really based on real life. They could have put any animal they wanted into the movie. The whole point of the movie is to tell a story about a young lion prince who is forced to leave his kingdom by his uncle. His uncle wants to take over the throne because he believes he deserves it more than his brother. After leaving his kingdom, he goes off to live in exile and forgets all about his family and responsibilities. When he eventually comes back, he learns that his father died and that his uncle took over the throne and drove him out. He then returns to his kingdom to fight for his rightful place.  However, this film is mostly about the journey of the young lion prince who grows from a weakling to a powerful king.  It's important to note that many Disney films are heavily inspired by myths and legends, especially those from Europe. The Lion King is no different. It takes some elements from the story of Hamlet, Shakespeare's play about a Danish prince who seeks revenge against his uncle after his father dies. In Hamlet, the protagonist's uncle is a Norwegian prince who murders his brother and marries his wife. However, in The Lion King, the protagonist's uncle is a talking lion who kills his brother and marries his wife.  The reason why there are other animals in the film besides lions is because the filmmakers wanted to create a vibrant and diverse environment. They also wanted to include animals that would appeal to children. Finally, the film was made for entertainment purposes only. There's no need for it to be realistic. The goal of the movie is to entertain people. If they wanted to fill the movie with nothing but lions, then they wouldn't have to use other animals to add color and depth to the world.",

And then I found out that schools aren't actually meant for education, they are more like prisons. If you were to look at the history of schools it goes back to the time of slavery where people were made to learn how to work so they would be better slaves. A lot of the things taught in schools don’t help anyone, but only serve to make us obedient and docile. The way these systems are set up is designed to keep us controlled, which makes me think that what they teach us isn’t really important, its more important that we are trained to accept everything that comes our way without questioning it. It also keeps us from becoming thinkers or problem solvers because we’re always told what to think and what to do. This system is not here for our benefit. We’re not supposed to grow up and become independent people with critical minds, we’re supposed to turn into workers who follow orders without question. What about the fact that most of what we learn is useless? Like, I went through algebra last year, and I still don’t know how to use it in real life. How many times have you heard someone say “I never used algebra in my life”? Most of the stuff they try to cram into our heads is just fluff and nonsense. And even if some of it is useful, it doesn't really prepare us for the world outside of school.  School doesn’t teach us anything about life skills, such as cooking, cleaning, basic repairs, budgeting, or personal finance. All it teaches us is how to memorize information and regurgitate it on tests. This is insane! It’s a waste of time and energy. So basically, going to school is designed to keep us subservient.",

Yesterday I went over to his house because he was out on the porch drinking again, and when I got there he started yelling at me and telling me that I should have never left him so long ago. I told him how sorry I am and tried to comfort him, but he just kept going on and on. I was getting really uncomfortable and upset by his behavior, so I said to him that if he kept acting like that I would leave. Then he yelled at me even louder, and he said some really awful things. At that point, I felt like I had no choice but to leave as well. So I did, and I haven't spoken to him since. I know I shouldn't have done that, and I feel really bad about it, but I also feel like I couldn't handle any more of his yelling and anger. I'm worried about him though, and I don't want him to be alone.  I feel like I should have stayed longer and listened to him, but I think I made the right decision in the end. What do you guys think?

The wedding was planned to be held at a church near my house, which is why I agreed to drive her to the venue. Her mom insisted that she stay over at her place, as she had never spent a night away from home before.  I drove her to the venue and helped set up decorations. During the ceremony, I went to get a drink at the bar, but when I came back, I saw her crying. When I asked her if something was wrong, she said it was because she couldn't stop thinking about how much money she had to spend on the wedding, and how the rest of her family would not be there. As I was trying to comfort her, her fiancé (who has been working at the bar) walked out on us. My best friend then started yelling at me, telling me to leave and go, and that I shouldn’t be around her during such an important day. She kept saying how stupid I was for ruining her special day.  I ended up leaving, but after the wedding, I realized that my actions ruined her entire wedding. I sent her a text apologizing for ruining her wedding, and she replied with “You always ruin things.”  Is AITA?",

I feel like they’re expecting me to be there for support and companionship, but I don’t know if I can commit to spending a whole day at their house when I’m busy with classes and work. I told her that I wasn’t sure if I could make it because of my schedule, and she said, “That’s too bad. You always say you’re busy.” She then said something else about how my life has changed and how I used to be more considerate of her feelings. She was being condescending, and I didn’t appreciate it. I just want to go to school to focus on getting through my studies without having to worry about anything.  I’ve told her many times that I miss her and want to see her, but she doesn’t seem to care about my feelings.

When I was younger I never thought much about it but recently, especially in the last few years, I've started seeing more and more similarities between her and older women (like grandma or something) - she has wrinkles, grey hair, and just generally looks like she's getting old.  I told her \"you look like an old lady\" during dinner when she was wearing a dress with a floral pattern and some makeup and she got really upset and cried. I felt terrible and apologized immediately but now I feel like I should have kept my thoughts to myself. She said I didn't have to say anything if I don't want to and that it's okay if I don't like how she looks. But I do! And I don't understand why she would put in all this effort to try and look young when she already has such a lovely personality. I also hate that she keeps buying all these things she doesn't need to make herself look pretty because she's getting old. I think she's getting sick of trying to look young and maybe she just wants to accept her age. I think she does realize that she's not looking good and that's why she's trying to hide it.

I feel sorry for her because she is already struggling in life with a lot of pressure, but I don’t understand why she is acting like this!

She just recently got pregnant with our first child, so I was expecting her to be more cautious in the kitchen. The day before yesterday, she made me something that looked like chicken pot pie. It tasted awful - salty, bitter, and dry. It reminded me of the time I had a bad flu, but worse. When I asked her why it was so bad, she told me she used only ingredients from the local market. Turns out, the salt she put into the pot was table salt which is almost 35% sodium chloride, not kosher salt, which has less sodium chloride and therefore tastes less salty. She also didn’t know that if you use too much rosemary, thyme, etc., the flavour will come across as bitter.  I immediately went on the defensive, saying that I knew a lot more about cooking than she did and how I would have done it differently. I don’t want to hurt her feelings, because I love her, but I think I should be allowed to express my opinion on how things can be improved.

She seemed kind of uncomfortable too, like she didn't want him to stare at her.  Lily and Jack were together all night, but I could see they weren't really into each other. They just kinda hung out. About an hour after I got there, I saw Jack and this other girl, Chloe, talking in a corner. Chloe looked around a lot, and I could tell she felt super uncomfortable.  I didn't hear what they were saying, but I did see Jack putting his hand on her shoulder. I started getting worried, so I went over to check on Chloe and ask her if she was okay. She said yes, but then she looked at me and gave me a really sad look. Then, Jack walked up to us and apologized to Chloe and told her that he wasn't paying attention and that he would stop it.  At first, I was mad at Jack for making Chloe feel uncomfortable, but then I realized that he probably just had a really hard time expressing himself. But I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was wrong, especially because Chloe looked really hurt. So I went to talk to Lily about it, and she asked me if I knew what was going on.
