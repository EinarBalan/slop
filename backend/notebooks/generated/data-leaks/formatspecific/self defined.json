They’ve added in more content but it still isn’t fun because the game is too punishing.  The current problems include:   1.  Too much grind for things like resources/gold   2.  Some bosses are just out-right broken and can easily kill a player with under 30% health left (like the last boss on the third tier)  3.  Can't properly see what is around you in most areas (even after upgrading your vision)   4.  There’s no way to upgrade the tools or weapons other than by spending gold which makes them almost useless without grinding for hours.   5.  So many bugs! It feels like they haven’t actually tested the game at all before releasing it.  What are your thoughts on how the developers should fix these issues?",

So I asked around online about meeting new people, and a friend suggested I offer rides to others going on road trips.   I ended up posting on Reddit asking if anyone would want to take a ride with me.  There were about 3 responses from strangers.   One person said they wouldn't want to just sit in the car, but asked if I wanted them to join me when I stopped at a place they were visiting.   Another person said they didn't want to make a long trip out of it, but they'd be happy to meet up when I got close to their location.   The third person said they'd love to join me! So we're talking about a few different scenarios here.   It seems odd that strangers would agree to get in the car with a complete stranger, but I think it might be possible.  I guess it depends on the people I talk to.  I don't really care where I'm going, I just want to have company.   Is there anything wrong with wanting to do this? Should I be worried?

    "self_text": "Okay so here’s the deal, I have been using my iPhone for years and it has gotten to the point where it annoys me more than anything. This isn’t about features or performance, just the things that get on my nerves. I know everyone loves their iPhones but I don’t really like them that much anymore.  So what is the most annoying thing about having an iPhone to you?  I think it’s the constant ads and promotions. Like, every time I open an app I get an ad for something!  It’s also when Apple tries to “improve” something with software updates. For example, they changed the way the volume buttons work on the newest iPhones, which made it harder to adjust the volume because you had to use two fingers instead of one. That was incredibly frustrating.  Or how they change the phone settings in iOS every year.  What do you guys think?  And it's not like other phones do that either.  Android phones seem to stay the same and only add features if you buy the new model.  So yeah… I just wanted to talk about this and see what others thought.",

    "self_text": "My partner and I have been together for about 2 years now, we live together and have been talking about getting married since about 6 months ago. Last night my partner told me she's not ready to marry me yet because she said I don't show her enough affection and wants me to be more affectionate with her.  I showed her how I'm naturally affectionate by cuddling when she falls asleep or if she has a nightmare, holding her hand while watching movies, and giving her hugs whenever I see her. She said these things aren't enough, so she suggested I try to do more things that would make her happy, such as buying her flowers and going out on dates.  I said I didn't know what she wanted from me, so she gave me a list of 10 things she wants me to do. I took her list and started doing all of those things but it feels forced and unnatural to me. Then last night she said she was tired of me trying to please her so she asked me to stop trying so hard.  She then said she doesn't want to get married until she knows I truly love her.  So I went over to her house, sat down and told her that I loved her and told her I was willing to work on making her happier but I wasn't going to force myself to change just to satisfy her wishes.  When I got home she blocked me on everything.  Do I need to apologize or should I leave her alone for a bit before reaching out again?",
