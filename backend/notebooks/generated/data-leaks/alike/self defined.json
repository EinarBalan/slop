When it goes into Windows, my games run a bit smoother, but if I go back to the loading screen, it gets stuck again.   Does anyone know what that black box does?",

    "self_text": "The term “Hristi” (Christ) is a Greek word for “redeemer”, but it’s not the only meaning associated with it. In the Old Testament, there was a ritual sacrifice of a lamb for atonement for sins.  The priest would place his hands on the lamb's head and pronounce a specific blessing over it. Then he would take a handful of its blood and sprinkle it before the altar as an offering to God for the forgiveness of sin. This was done every year.   In the New Testament, when Jesus came into the world, he became the ultimate lamb and atoned for the sins of all people, both Jews and Gentiles. He took upon himself the penalty for our sins and died on the cross so we could be redeemed from eternal punishment. He then rose again from the dead and ascended to heaven, where he now reigns with his Father.   His sacrifice was more than just an animal being sacrificed; it was an act of love, and redemption, which allowed us to enter into fellowship with God.    When the Orthodox Church says “Hristi” (Christ), it's referring to His ultimate sacrifice for the salvation of humanity. So, the meaning of “Hristi” goes beyond the literal translation of the word.   It also refers to the idea of redemption through Christ's death, burial, and resurrection.   It represents the ultimate sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins.  We can find references to the word “Hristi” in the Bible such as Romans 5:8: “But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, God reconciled us to himself through the Lord Jesus Christ.”",

I saw a YouTube video from pastor Mark Driscoll where he said, “Jesus gave us forgiveness and we were given an opportunity to forgive others.” I think his message was trying to say that Jesus forgives us but we have to make a choice to forgive those who have wronged us.  However, I just wanted to know if “unforgiven” is used as a technical term when referring to someone who has been forgiven by God.   If so, what does it mean? Does it mean that God never stops forgiving us?",

I have been looking into various techniques to accomplish this and want to test out a few different approaches for my specific game genre (action-adventure) which involves verticality as well as horizontal movement.  It’s important to note that this game has 2 main movement systems, one for horizontal movement and another for vertical movement. The horizontal movement feels good so far but it is the vertical movement I’m most concerned with.",

It’s saying that you can turn something bad into something good, like using a broken piece of glass to make a beautiful sculpture.   Also, I think it has a bit of a religious connotation too, speaking about forgiveness. You need to forgive yourself for making mistakes and move on.  It is not easy but if you focus on the beauty of life and what you have instead of dwelling on what you lost, you will be able to find peace.",
