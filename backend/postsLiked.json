I was skeptical, I mean I've always thought of vinyl as this really old fashioned material that's made from, well, real materials, like vinyl. But the employee told me that almost all new vinyl records are made from recycled plastic. Apparently the old records that get thrown away are collected and melted down to make new ones.

Apparently, this is because our brains are still recovering from the weekend and our reaction times are slower. I know it sounds weird, but it's true. I've been doing some research and it seems that this is because our brains have to wake up from a state of reduced activity and it takes a while to get back to full alertness.

As I was coming out one night from work, I did what a lot of us would do and ripped off my surgical mask to breathe in some fresh air.   When I did it, I felt the earring come out of my ear because it got caught on the mask ear loop.   I heard it hit the ground and I took my phone out to look for it, but it was a dark parking lot and I just couldn\u2019t find it.  It was a small white gold hoop.  I searched for it the next day during the daylight, but was unable to find it.  It\u2019s a busy parking lot in the city, so I figured it was long gone. I was bummed because it was favorite daily wear earrings and they were not super cheap to replace.  I can only wear gold because everything else gives me an allergic reaction, so I just haven\u2019t worn earrings for the last two years for fear of the same thing happening again.  I put the remaining earring in my jewelry box because I keep my scrap gold jewelry in case I need to get something repaired.   Well, today, almost exactly two years later I noticed something on my sunporch that was shiny.  I reached down and picked up a small white gold hoop earring.   I thought it was weird because I remembered specifically putting it in my jewelry box in the little drawer were I keep my scrap gold.  I went to the jewelry box and sure enough, there it was.   So now I have the original set and no explanation how the missing earring made it back home.  I have regularly vacuumed and swept that sunporch over the last two years and I specifically remember the incident in the parking lot because I was so bummed about losing my earring.",

I thought nothing of it at the time but it got me thinking. I decided to test her skills so I set up a mini climbing wall in my garage and to my surprise she nailed it. She's been climbing ever since and it's honestly the funniest thing to watch. She's not as fast as a human but she's definitely got the agility and strength for it. I'm thinking of getting her a climbing harness and some ropes so she can join the climbing club at the local gym. Has anyone else out there had a pet with an unusual talent?",

People will call in to book a massage but refuse to disclose when they want to come in, even when they are looking for a specific time slot.  For example a client wants to book a 4pm appointment. They call and ask what time do you have available.  I answer 11am.  They respond, \"no that won't do\".  I ask when would you like to come in.  Instead of telling me when they want to come in they will repeatedly ask what times I have available until I basically guess the time they want.  What I don't understand is if they are looking for a specific slot and can only come in at a specific time why not lead with that? Why waste their own time?

I spent 10 years working with these slimy creatures and learned a lot about them. Here are some interesting facts about snails.\n\nFirst, snails are highly intelligent. They can learn to navigate mazes and remember routes they've taken before. They're also very curious and will explore their surroundings to find food and shelter.\n\nSecond, snails are very social creatures. They live in communities and have a complex hierarchy. They even have a way of communicating with each other through a series of clicks and whistles.\n\nThird, snails are incredibly resilient. They can survive for a long time without water and can even seal themselves in a protective shell to protect themselves from predators.\n\nLastly, snails are very romantic creatures. They mate for life and are very loyal to their partners.\n\nI'm not sure why I'm sharing this, but I just found out that I'm getting laid off from my job as a snail trainer and I'm feeling a little nostalgic. Anybody else have any weird jobs they've had in the past?",

I've tried to get to know him a bit, but he's always brushed me off with a friendly but vague response.\n\nSo yesterday, my boss asked me to help him move a couch from the conference room to his house. I agreed, thinking it would be a good opportunity to get to know Dave a bit better. We got to his house and started loading up the couch. As we were carrying it up the stairs, I asked him if he needed any help. He said no, but I could see him straining under the weight of the couch.\n\nI decided to help him lift it up the rest of the way, and as we were setting it down, I asked him if he needed any more help. He said no, but then he looked at me with a sly grin and said \"I've got one more thing to show you.\" He pulled out a guitar from behind the couch and started playing a sick solo. I was shocked - I had no idea he played guitar.\n\nIt turned out that Dave is a huge fan of 80s rock music and has been playing guitar since he was a kid. He's been playing in a band with his friends on the weekends, and they've even played a few gigs around town. I was blown away by his talent, and we ended up talking for hours about music and rock history.\n\nI feel like I've known Dave for years, not just hours.

I'm confused but I shrug it off and tell myself I must have slept in and missed breakfast.\n\nBut then I see the same conversation with my friends in my head, the same jokes, the same laughter. I try to shake it off but I'm starting to feel a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\n\nI get to work and my boss tells me that we're having a meeting at 2 PM to discuss the Johnson account. I'm thinking to myself \"this is getting weird\". But then I start to feel that same sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu again.\n\nI'm working at my desk and I see the same coworkers around me, the same computers, the same papers. It's like I'm living the same day over and over.\n\nI try to take a break and go outside and I see the same people walking down the street, the same cars driving by. I'm starting to lose my grip on reality.\n\nI come home and my family is making dinner, the same dinner we had last night. I'm starting to feel like I'm stuck in some kind of time loop.\n\nI've been trying to figure out what's going on but I'm stumped. I've been going through the same day over and over and I'm starting to lose my mind.\n\nHas anyone else experienced anything like this? Any ideas on what's going on?",

There was a little boy who was about 4 years old and he was absolutely smitten with a goat. He kept going up to the goat and giving it hugs and kisses. The goat just took it all in stride and even seemed to be enjoying it. Then the boy started feeding the goat and it started to nuzzle his hands and lick his face. It was like they were the best of friends. The cuteness was almost too much to handle. The rest of the fair was pretty standard, but that little interaction between the boy and the goat was definitely the highlight of my day.",

I don\u2019t work in actual social work, but I do work in low income housing (at a Housing Authority) as a caseworker, and I feel like this might be the closest spot on Reddit for asking this question!   I am the housing caseworker for 3 separate properties (and two different programs). I handle things for current tenants of those properties, including income reexaminations, annual inspections, and all the other program rules HUD requires \u2014 most of which have to do with the income exams and inspections. I also handle things for people wanting to join the program and move into the properties \u2014 income checking, citizenship/immigration and background verification, securing socials/birth certificates/ID/etc, and completing the leases, rent calculations, and getting security deposits. It is a job I love a LOT and find really fulfilling, but I\u2019ve reached a point where I\u2019m absolutely at the end of my rope.   I have to have communication with the property staff \u2014 who collect rent, enforce the lease, handle maintenance requests, and other various property management style duties. For the past 5 months, despite MULTIPLE talks \u2014we are talking DOUBLE DIGIT sit down meetings \u2014 nothing is being communicated with me. For example, When someone moves out, I have two days to process that in our system in order to trigger a refund of their security deposit. That is a legal standard for the program we are part of. I am not being told about people moving out until weeks or even months later. I am not being told when there are pending evictions, Im not being told about people who change their minds about moving in \u2014 nothing is being communicated to me. These things are critical for me doing my job. I\u2019ve given up on this shit ever being resolved, because if no less than 16 meetings has gotten the point across, I doubt anything will.   I am the one tasked with training new employees \u2014 including new supervisors (I am not a supervisor!).  I have to help out one of my coworkers who is drowning in late work (a caseload she inherited that hadn\u2019t been worked in over a year) as well as helping the other programs in the building. Our IT department is woefully awful, and I\u2019m under 35, so I also have to play IT. I pride myself on being organized and good at my job (I\u2019ve gotten an award for shining star employee of the year!), but I feel like my job and the clientele I serve are suffering because I cannot stay ahead.   I am just so burnt out! I have stress nightmares. What do y\u2019all do to help maintain boundaries? To help the burnout? I do not want to quit my job \u2014 I truly love what I do.

I started to Become more Distant with my girlfriend and started to focus more on her flaws this week convincing myself that I was losing feelings. I guess this is my way of copping out and telling myself that all I need is myself in order to become more happy and stop feeling depressed. So eventually I broke the news to her I told her I was losing feelings I didn\u2019t break up with her yet but  I just wanted to let her know how I was feeling. This obviously destroyed her and she became very sad I told her that I try to see if I could rekindle those feelings knowing that I was going to break up with her a week or so passes by the end of things she took it very well we ended on good terms and we went our separate ways. Immediately after I begin to regret my decision but I was trying to convince myself as if it was the right choice for me every day pass by and I felt like my mental health was worsening and it was becoming suicidal. Two weeks have gone by now and I\u2019ve told her how I feel and that I want her back and I want to mend things and work through things. Understandably she told me that she has been recovering from everything and can just go back into a relationship just like that. And that she has felt like she is becoming a better version of herself and trying to love herself. She said she needed to see growth between both of us before we ever got back together.

I was in the audience and I was playing guitar with a band that was made up of pandas, we were doing a great set and everyone was dancing and having a great time. The whole festival was being held on a giant floating island in the sky and it was lit up with thousands of tiny lights that looked like fireflies.",

He has a home sawmill, which makes him some money - buys logs and uses the large and straight ones for lumber, and the rest for firewood. He does not grow his own food - usually just eats food that doesn't need to be cooked.  BUT - his income comes from a full time job at a local sawmill. Has worked there for 33 years.   Otherwise, his lifestyle is fully that of most homesteaders. Spends his off time working on his property, or helping other people. Has a tractor, farm/work truck, countless tools along with the sawmill, does all his own repairs and such.  No cell phone, landline, computer, or even a debit card.  What do think?

I lost to my friends friend(F17) who i thought was really cute and had really cool outfits. I asked my friend to help and set my up with her and she did it for me! We are both seniors and she is from Thailand, it's super cool.  We met for the first time in the library during lunch and talked a bit about our general interests. The problem here is we are both EXTREMELY SHY and awkward. I've never had a girlfriend or the opportunity to get to know a single girl and work my way up to asking her out. I think we hit it off a bit but I don't know what to do from here without seeming pushy or weird about it. Today was a significant bit more quite.  Today we talked a little about what she does after school and she said the friends she doesn't hangout with are far or their parents are strict. We live in the same general area so I said \"Well then maybe we could hangout sometime because we live close and my parents aren't too strict.\" and then she said \"I also work a lot though\" she works at a little place inside a store and they get a lot of people calling in sick lately so it makes sense. But that part of me can't help but feel like it was more of a \"no I don't think I'd want to hang out with you\" type thing.  How do i progress a relationship normally? I've been antisocial for most of high school so I'm really bad at this. I know she was fine with getting to know me like that because that's what my friend told her. But I also don't want to bore her and make her uninterested.  TLDR: I'm a antisocial guy trying to talk to a really shy girl, how do i progress normally without being weird or without boring her?",

For context, the state of Colorado recently came after me saying I owe state income taxes for 2018. I did not live in Colorado at the time, but I had accidentally used my parents\u2019 home address in CO on my W4 as I had not moved into my new city when I started the Job 1 (and forgot to change it once I moved - my mistake!). I already paid them the taxes I \u201cowed\u201d in 2017 when I started Job 1 - it was a headache to deal with so I just paid and thought that would be the end of it. I stayed at Job 1 until September of 2018, when I started Job 2. I used the correct state (not CO) when filling out my W4 for Job 2. The letter I received stating the income I owe taxes on in 2018 is for the total income I made between Job 1 and Job 2, so I\u2019m confused why it would be that amount if my W2 for Job 2 does not have a CO address. I\u2019m concerned they will keep coming after me for subsequent years even though I filled out W4s with the correct state address for subsequent jobs. Thanks in advance for any info/advice!",

Here's what newegg says when I compare the two (if that link doesn't work just yell at me or something to fix it xD):  Computer parts, laptops, electronics, and more - Newegg United States   Space in the case is not a concern and I have enough wattage to support the 3060 card (I have a 650W power supply)  Also wondering what they mean when they say, \" 2 x HDMI 2.1\" That means it'll still give me 2 HDMI ports right? I need that for my monitor and my drawing tablet.  Any feedback would seriously be awsome. Thanks <3",

I don\u2019t work in actual social work, but I do work in low income housing (at a Housing Authority) as a caseworker, and I feel like this might be the closest spot on Reddit for asking this question!   I am the housing caseworker for 3 separate properties (and two different programs). I handle things for current tenants of those properties, including income reexaminations, annual inspections, and all the other program rules HUD requires \u2014 most of which have to do with the income exams and inspections. I also handle things for people wanting to join the program and move into the properties \u2014 income checking, citizenship/immigration and background verification, securing socials/birth certificates/ID/etc, and completing the leases, rent calculations, and getting security deposits. It is a job I love a LOT and find really fulfilling, but I\u2019ve reached a point where I\u2019m absolutely at the end of my rope.   I have to have communication with the property staff \u2014 who collect rent, enforce the lease, handle maintenance requests, and other various property management style duties. For the past 5 months, despite MULTIPLE talks \u2014we are talking DOUBLE DIGIT sit down meetings \u2014 nothing is being communicated with me. For example, When someone moves out, I have two days to process that in our system in order to trigger a refund of their security deposit. That is a legal standard for the program we are part of. I am not being told about people moving out until weeks or even months later. I am not being told when there are pending evictions, Im not being told about people who change their minds about moving in \u2014 nothing is being communicated to me. These things are critical for me doing my job. I\u2019ve given up on this shit ever being resolved, because if no less than 16 meetings has gotten the point across, I doubt anything will.   I am the one tasked with training new employees \u2014 including new supervisors (I am not a supervisor!).  I have to help out one of my coworkers who is drowning in late work (a caseload she inherited that hadn\u2019t been worked in over a year) as well as helping the other programs in the building. Our IT department is woefully awful, and I\u2019m under 35, so I also have to play IT. I pride myself on being organized and good at my job (I\u2019ve gotten an award for shining star employee of the year!), but I feel like my job and the clientele I serve are suffering because I cannot stay ahead.   I am just so burnt out! I have stress nightmares. What do y\u2019all do to help maintain boundaries? To help the burnout? I do not want to quit my job \u2014 I truly love what I do. But my mental health is suffering massively.",
