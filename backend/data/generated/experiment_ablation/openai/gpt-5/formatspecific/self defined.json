  "title: AITA for labeling our fridge shelves after my boyfriend kept rearranging my leftovers like a museum exhibit?\n self_text: My boyfriend (29M) and I (27F) moved in together six months ago and overall it’s been great, except for one weird ongoing issue: he treats the fridge like it’s his personal art installation. He calls it “curating the coldscape.” Every time I put groceries away, he moves everything “for optimal flow.” That means my yogurt gets tucked behind pickles, fruit goes to the dairy shelf because “color contrast,” and he’ll decant leftovers into mystery containers with no labels because “labels ruin the aesthetic.” I’ve asked him multiple times to stop rearranging my stuff because I can’t find anything and things go bad. I’ve thrown out more wilted greens in the last month than in years. We tried compromising: he could arrange the door and one shelf however he wants, and I’d keep the rest how I need it. That lasted two days. So last week, after losing an entire curry (RIP) to the void behind three jars of olives, I printed simple labels: “Top shelf: dairy,” “Middle: leftovers,” etc., and a small “Please don’t move” sticker on my containers. Nothing aggressive, just clear. He got mad and said I’m “policing the fridge” and making our home feel like a kindergarten classroom. Over the weekend he had two friends over and made a joke about my “control freak stickers,” which was embarrassing. I told him the labels are staying until he can actually leave my food where I put it. He says I’m being inflexible and killing his joy in his own home. I think I’m just trying to keep food safe and not waste money. AITA for labeling the fridge?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for labeling my Tupperware with Latin plant names so my boyfriend would stop “sharing” my lunches?\n self_text: I (28F) live with my boyfriend (29M) and we share a fridge with two roommates. I meal prep vegetarian lunches for the week because I’m busy and on a budget. Despite multiple conversations and labeling “Please don’t eat,” my boyfriend keeps taking my containers “because what’s yours is mine.” We split groceries 50/50, but he eats more than half of my prepped stuff and tells me to “just make more.”\n\nI’m a botany grad student with a label maker. So last week I labeled my containers herbarium-style: “Brassica oleracea var. italica 250g,” “Oryza sativa 200g,” “Cicer arietinum 150g,” etc. Translation: broccoli, rice, chickpeas. He didn’t touch them for days. Then he found out via a roommate that it was just normal food with fancy names, and now he’s furious, saying I “weaponized Latin,” made him “feel stupid,” and embarrassed him because our roommates joked he got beaten by spells.\n\nI told him I’d switch back to English labels if he stops eating my portions, or I can make extra if he pays the difference. He said I’m being petty and controlling and that I should be happy to share. I can’t afford a separate fridge or to remake meals every time he raids mine.\n\nAITA for labeling food in Latin to deter him instead of just giving up and making more?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for creating a “library checkout” system for my boyfriend because he keeps “borrowing” my stuff and never returning it?\n self_text: My boyfriend (28M) and I (27F) have lived together for a year. He constantly “borrows” my things—chargers, headphones, Tupperware, hair dryer, my nice chef’s knife, even the power drill I bought—and they vanish into his office, car, gym bag, or the abyss. I end up spending 10–20 minutes a day hunting for basic items. I’ve tried: asking nicely, setting up a shared basket, labeling shelves, even a weekly “return bin.” It works for two days and then we’re back to me using a fork to pry open paint cans because the screwdriver is on a road trip in his trunk.\n\nLast week, after he “borrowed” my laptop charger and I found it three days later wedged under his couch cushions, I snapped and made a goofy “library checkout” system. I stuck little adhesive pockets and cards on commonly borrowed items. If he wants to use something, he writes his name/date on the card and slips it in. I also put a $1/day “late fee” jar on the counter. It’s tongue-in-cheek, and the fees go toward mutual takeout. I even made cute stamps. It took me an hour on a Sunday and I honestly thought it would be funny and help us both keep track.\n\nHe did not think it was funny. He said I’m treating him like a child, that it’s condescending and “weaponized office culture.” I said I’m treating him like a roommate who keeps losing shared resources. For the record, in the first week I recovered: 2 chargers, 1 knife, 3 Tupperware lids, the drill bit set, and my hair dryer. Late fees amounted to $6, which I put toward dumplings. He refused to eat them “on principle.”\n\nHe went to stay at a friend’s for two nights to “cool off.” Our group chat is split. Half think it’s hilarious and functional; the other half says systems like this create resentment and I should have just hidden my stuff. To me that feels worse and more petty.\n\nAITA for instituting a playful system to solve a real problem, or did I cross a line by turning our apartment into Dewey Decimal hell?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for eating my boyfriend's \"decorative\" eggs?\n self_text: I'm 29F and my boyfriend (31M) keeps a big ceramic bowl of eggs on the counter because he says they \"tie the kitchen together.\" He calls them his \"decorative eggs\" and told me not to touch them because they \"complete the vibe.\" I thought he was joking and also noticed the carton they came from was nearing the best-by date in the fridge, so I used six to make an omelet when my friend came over. He came home, saw the empty shells in the trash, and lost it. He said I \"devoured the architecture of our home,\" canceled our weekend plans, and then Venmo-requested me $48 for \"lost ambiance\" plus $6 for basil because \"the basil only looked good next to the eggs.\" He has now replaced the bowl with wooden eggs and sent me a Google Sheet labeled \"Aesthetic Pantry (Do Not Consume)\" that includes things like a baguette that must remain uneaten for three days for \"visual patina,\" a vintage cereal box that is allowed to be opened but only if it's refilled with new cereal so the box never looks slumped, and a lemon \"for mood.\" He says I need to apologize and agree to the spreadsheet rules or we should \"rethink cohabitation.\" I told him I'll pay for actual food I use, but I'm not paying for vibes or keeping a prop department in the kitchen. He says I'm dismissive of his hobbies and that \"design is sustenance for the soul.\" For what it's worth, I regularly cook and buy groceries; he likes to arrange them. His mom texted me that I should \"respect the artist.\" My friends think it's unhinged.

  "title: AITA for issuing \"dish citations\" to my boyfriend for leaving bowls to \"soak\" for days?\n self_text: My boyfriend (29M) and I (28F) live together. He will leave bowls “to soak” for literal days. I’ve asked nicely, set a 2-hour soaking timer, even made a simple chore chart. Nothing sticks. Last week, after I accidentally elbowed a milky spoon avalanche, I printed fake “Department of Sinkland” citations (on sticky notes) with checkboxes like “Failure to Rinse,” “Abandoned Pasta Barnacles,” and “Soak Exceeding 24 Hours.” The “fine” was either washing the items immediately or doing one of my chores as a swap. I also put a tiny rubber band “boot” on the sponge until the fine was “paid.” At first he laughed, then got mad when I stuck three citations on a bowl that had been “marinating” in grey water since Wednesday. He said I’m treating him like a child and turning our home into HR. I said it was a jokey, last-resort escalation after many talks, and it actually worked for a few days. He claims soaking is vital for “casserole physics” and that I’m prioritizing vibes over science. I countered that “soak” should mean 2–3 hours max, not a long weekend with algae. For context: we both work 9–5, dishes are his weekday chore, I do laundry/trash and most cooking. I’d happily swap chores permanently, but he insists dishes are “easy” and then doesn’t do them.

  "title: AITA for charging my fiancé $1 every time I find his “lost” stuff and putting it in a house “lost and found” box?\n self_text: I (29F) live with my fiancé “J” (31M). I love him, he’s kind and funny, but he is chronically allergic to putting his things in the same place twice. Every day it’s “Babe, have you seen my keys/wallet/ID/AirPods/left shoe/that pen from the bank?” Sometimes multiple times a day. He’ll call me from the driveway because he can’t find his keys and they’re on the coffee table behind his sunglasses, etc.\n\nI WFH and this has started to eat into my meetings and focus. Over the last year I’ve done all the “helpful partner” things: I bought a key hook by the door, a tray for his wallet, a little bowl for odds and ends, even slapped a Bluetooth tracker on his keys. I labeled drawers. I gently reminded. I less-gently reminded. I stopped reminding. Nothing stuck.\n\nSo about a month ago, I made a house “Lost & Found” box. If I find something of his in a random place (keys in the freezer, AirPod in a plant, gym card on top of the microwave), it goes in the box. There’s a sign on it that says “Lost & Found – $1 retrieval fee – proceeds to Date Night Fund.” I told him the purpose wasn’t to punish him but to incentivize using the trays/hooks we already have, and to make it less of an unpaid job for me to be his personal metal detector. I also said if he puts things in their designated spots, they never go in the box and there’s no fee. Win-win.\n\nFor the first week, he thought it was funny. He’d drop a dollar in the jar and say, “Thank you for your service.” But over the next couple of weeks he ended up paying $12 total because I kept finding things in bizarre places and putting them in the box. He got annoyed and said I was being petty and “taxing” him at home. I said I’m literally handing the dollars back to us for a date night and that he can avoid the “tax” by putting things where they go.\n\nThis past weekend it came to a head when he was late for the gym and his membership card was in the box. He grumbled that I “hid” it from him and made him late. I pointed to the sign and the empty hook where the card lanyard is supposed to live. He slammed a dollar down, took the card, and left. Later he told his mom (who loves to weigh in) and she called me “nickel-and-diming” and “controlling” and said if I really loved him I’d just help him because “some people are forgetful.” J echoed that and said I’m “making a game out of his ADHD” (he’s never been diagnosed, and he hasn’t expressed interest in pursuing that; he just says he’s “scatterbrained”).\n\nFor what it’s worth, I’ve offered other solutions: I sat with him to set up more trackers, suggested we try a shared checklist on the door, and I even offered to stop the lost-and-found if he commits to 2 weeks of using the tray/hook system. He said he doesn’t like “systems” and wants me to “just tell [him] where stuff is” because I “always know.” To be honest, I usually do, because I’m the one who finds it.\n\nI don’t think $1 is cruel or punitive, and I’m not keeping the money for myself. It’s gone toward our sushi date and a movie. The main goal was to stop being interrupted all day and to nudge him into a routine. He’s framing it like I’m punishing him for being forgetful and embarrassing him with my little box. I feel like I’m just trying to create boundaries around my time and mental load.\n\nAITA for the $1 “lost and found” system?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for implementing a full household inventory system and issuing my partner a \"gentle reminder\" for a missing spoon?\n self_text: I (31M) live with my partner “Lena” (29F). She’s wonderful, but we both get stressed by how often things go missing—keys, remotes, chargers, tape measure, that one whisk, etc. After a passport fiasco last year (we tore the apartment apart and still missed our train), I joked that what we needed was “warehouse-level organization.” She laughed and said, “If you want to nerd out with labels, go for it—just don’t rope me into it.”\n\nI’m a supply chain analyst, so I… went for it. I set up a very lightweight system: small clear QR stickers on shared items (remotes, keys, tool kit, chargers, pantry staples that constantly vanish, a few utensils), plus a little check-in/out tray by the door. Scan to “check out,” scan to “check in,” and it logs the last-seen location. I didn’t tag personal items (no journals, makeup, clothing, etc.). I also set the scanner to a quick “beep” because it made me laugh and honestly helped me remember to do it. For the first week, it worked great. We found the tape measure in seconds instead of days. No more nightly “Where’s the remote?” scavenger hunts.\n\nThen…the spoon incident. Lena took Spoon #12 (yes, I numbered the common-use spoons; I promise the stickers are tiny) to work for yogurt and forgot to scan it. It went missing for two days. I printed a silly “Gentle Reminder: Missing Asset—Spoon #12” slip with a smiley face and stuck it on the fridge. I intended it as a joke. She did not find it funny. She said it felt dehumanizing and like I was turning our home into her job. I apologized and explained I was trying to make light of it. She said the labels make the place feel sterile and performative.\n\nI offered compromises:\n- Remove labels from visible/pretty items\n- Keep tags only on the frequent offenders (keys/remote/chargers/tools)\n- Silence the beep\n- No “person” tracking—just last location\n- No more printed “warnings” or jokey slips\n\nShe said she doesn’t want any scanning at all. She also peeled a few labels off, and when I replaced them with clear ones, she got more frustrated. The worst moment: we had friends over, someone picked up the remote, it did the little “beep,” and a friend asked what that was. Lena looked mortified. That night she told me I was choosing order over her comfort.\n\nFrom my side: before this, we’d lose 20+ minutes a day to searching. This saved time, reduced bickering, and honestly made me feel calmer. But I get that I escalated quickly and the “warning slip” was tone-deaf. I also realize that even if I see it as optional and helpful, she might feel monitored or managed.\n\nAITA for putting this system in place after she gave a casual green light, and for the dumb spoon “reminder”? Should I scrap it entirely and accept the daily search chaos? Or is there a middle ground like:\n- A single “drop zone” basket and no labels\n- AirTags on keys only\n- Silent NFC dots inside drawers (invisible)\n- Or “if you care about the system, you scan; if not, you don’t,” and I accept partial data?\n\nI genuinely don’t want to make home feel like work. I do want us to stop losing our lives to the hunt for a charger. Am I the asshole here?\n subreddit: r/AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for labeling our fridge shelves after my boyfriend kept \"foraging\" my meals?\n self_text: Been with my boyfriend (28M) for 2 years, living together 6 months. I (27F) work 12-hour hospital shifts and batch-cook six meals on Sundays. Every week at least two go missing. He says the fridge is \"communal\" and that if it's in a shared space it's fair game, and he \"foraged\" them when he was \"starving between Zooms.\" I asked him to stop; he said to write his name on what’s his, not the other way around. So I labeled shelves and containers \"Please don’t eat—prepped for work\" and even color-coded lids. He peeled off the labels and said he felt \"policed in his own home.\" Last week I put my meals in a small cooler with a combo lock on the zipper (literally a luggage lock) and he blew up, saying I'm treating him like a child and creating a \"hostile kitchen environment.\" I pointed out I pay half the groceries, I’m not locking up his food, and I only lock mine because I’m tired and don’t have time to cook twice. He says I’m controlling and should just make extra for both of us, but he doesn’t like my “boring” food and ends up DoorDashing anyway if I do. He’s now sulking and told our friends I put a padlock on the fridge, which isn’t true. They’re split: some say it’s petty, others say he’s being entitled.

  "title: AITA for setting a 24-hour soak timer for dishes and moving anything that exceeds it into a labeled \"archaeological dig\" bin?\n self_text: My boyfriend (29M) and I (28F) moved in six months ago and his approach to dishes is \"let it soak\" for literal days. I cook a lot and meal-prep, so the sink turns into a swamp if stuff sits. We tried a chores chart and talking; nothing stuck. I proposed a compromise: a 24-hour soak rule with a little magnetic timer. If a dish is still \"soaking\" when the timer dings, I drain the water and put it in a clear bin I labeled \"Archaeological Dig\" so it doesn’t rot in the sink or attract fruit flies. The bin is not punishment; it’s containment, and he agreed to the 24-hour rule. It worked for a week, then he left his cast-iron skillet and blender jar \"soaking\" for three days. I drained them and put them in the bin so the sink was usable. He came home, saw the pan in the bin, and blew up that I’m \"weaponizing organization\" and \"sabotaging\" his cookware. For the record, I didn’t scrub the cast iron; I literally just took it out of standing water. I pointed out we agreed to the rule, it’s a shared space, and I’ve already tossed one batch of fruit-fly traps this summer. He says I’m controlling and that dishes are his pace and my timer is infantilizing. I say if he wants his pace, he needs to keep it off our only sink. I even offered to swap: I do all dishes if he cooks all week, but he declined. Now it’s tense and he wants me to ditch the timer and the bin.

  "title: AITA for sending my husband a calendar invite titled \"Q3 Dishwashing Summit\" after he ignored my requests to help more at home?\n self_text: I (29F) work from home full-time and my husband (31M) is hybrid. We both work long hours, but since I’m physically at home, the bulk of cleaning somehow defaults to me. I’ve brought it up several times, and he says he’ll “do better,” but nothing sticks longer than a week.\n\nI’m a project manager by trade, so (yes, nerd alert) I tried to approach it like a project. I created a 30-minute recurring calendar invite twice a week called “Q3 Dishwashing Summit: Alignment + Action Items” with a short agenda: Dishes, Trash/Recycling, Floors, Laundry, and “Blockers.” I put it on our shared family Google calendar and invited his personal email. I thought the silly title would make it less confrontational and more… team-building?\n\nWhat I did not realize is that his personal calendar is synced to his work calendar and visible (title-only) to his team by default. He didn’t notice the invite until his manager jokingly asked in their stand-up if he needed budget approval for “Q3 Dishwashing.” He was mortified, came home annoyed, and said I publicly embarrassed him and treated him like a junior employee.\n\nI immediately changed future events to “Private” with a boring title and apologized for not realizing the visibility settings. But I pointed out that I’ve tried casual talks for months, and this was a structured way to actually commit. He says I crossed a line and weaponized work tools to shame him.\n\nAITA for using a calendar (with a joking title) to get accountability, even though it accidentally bled into his work visibility?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for making a PowerPoint to answer \"What do you want for dinner?\"\n self_text: I'm 29M, my girlfriend is 27F. For months, the nightly \"What do you want for dinner?\" turns into a loop: I say \"I'm good with anything,\" she says \"I need input,\" I suggest three things, she vetoes all three, then we spiral and end up eating cereal. I thought it would be funny/helpful to make a 12-slide PowerPoint with (1) a flowchart of cravings, (2) budget tiers, (3) commute time vs. wait time graph, and (4) a wheel spin video with our top options. The conclusion suggested tacos. I emailed it to her at 4:30 with the subject \"Q3 Dinner Strategy,\" then presented it when she got home, laser pointer and all. She laughed at first but then got upset and said I was mocking her and turning a simple question into a bit. She said if I cared, I'd just pick a place without theatrics. I said I literally picked tacos, with data. She said the \"work vibe\" killed her appetite and went to bed. Now she's short with me and says I don't take her feelings seriously. My intention was to break the stalemate and make it light, not belittle her. AITA for trying to systematize dinner, or is the presentation what crossed the line?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for making a \"couch custody schedule\" so my partner stops hogging the chaise?\n self_text: I (29M) live with my girlfriend (27F). We have an L-shaped sectional with a chaise—aka The Prime Spot. For two years, every movie night, she beelines for the chaise. If I get water or pause to turn off a lamp, boom, she’s starfished with the blanket and remote like she just claimed land for a new empire.\n\nI asked if we could switch sometimes. She said, “You don’t even like lying down during movies.” Which is partly true—I don’t like lying down with no blanket, no pillow, and a cold remote out of reach, which is what’s left when you do the chaise sweep.\n\nSo I made a “couch custody schedule.” It’s literally a shared Google Calendar: M/W/F she gets the chaise, T/Th/Sat I get it, Sundays are free-for-all. I also labeled the throw blankets with tiny tags (A, B, C) to rotate usage so one doesn’t get gross, and I put two coasters on the coffee table that say “Remote Lives Here” so it stops vanishing into Blanket Narnia.\n\nShe ignored the schedule the first week and said, “Schedules are for dentists, not couches.” So, admittedly, I escalated: I placed a body pillow across the chaise like a soft “parking boot” with a sticky note that said “Reserved per rotation—violators will be rerouted to ottoman.” It was meant to be funny and also gently enforce the system.\n\nShe did not think it was funny. She called it “deranged HOA energy” and said I’m turning our house into a compliance office. I tried to explain it’s about fairness and preventing couch divots in the same spot (those are real!), plus if we plan it, nobody has to silently resent the other person for 90 minutes during Dune.\n\nHer take: if I want the chaise, I should just ask in the moment rather than pushing a calendar invite like I’m scheduling a performance review. My take: asking in the moment has not worked, and I’m tired of the petty sprint-to-sit dynamic like we’re boarding Southwest.\n\nFriends are split: one says the schedule is cringe but the fairness is valid; another says I’m being controlling over furniture; my mom said, “Pick your battles; buy another chaise.” I removed the body-pillow boot, but I kept the calendar and labels. Girlfriend is still annoyed and says she won’t “RSVP yes” to sitting down in her own living room.\n\nAITA for systematizing couch fairness?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for putting “Do Not Eat” labels on all our houseplants after my boyfriend kept snacking on them?\n self_text: My boyfriend and I moved in together a few months ago. I keep a little window herb garden (basil, mint, chives) plus a bunch of regular houseplants because the apartment needs green.\n\nHe has a habit of grazing. The first time I found him literally plucking basil leaves and eating them, I laughed and said it was fine, just leave some for cooking. Then I caught him nibbling the mint (also fine) but a week later I saw him with a pothos leaf in his hand, and my soul left my body. I told him pothos is toxic to cats and not great for humans either. He said he “just wanted to see if it was as peppery as arugula” and immediately spit it out. He was fine, but it freaked me out.\n\nTo avoid any more “taste tests,” I bought plant tags and labeled everything: “Edible” for the herbs, and “Do Not Eat” for the houseplants. I even added a little red or green icon to make it extra clear. In a moment of what I thought was harmless humor, I also labeled our plastic IKEA plant “Do Not Eat” because it sits near the kitchen and, well, it’s plastic.\n\nCue last weekend. His mom came over and saw the tags. She zeroed in on the fake plant and asked why on earth there’s a “Do Not Eat” label on it. I explained the whole situation lightly, like, “He loves to snack and I wanted to keep him from accidentally eating the toxic ones.” My boyfriend got embarrassed and later told me I’d made him look like a toddler. He said the labels (especially the fake plant one) were condescending and I should have just trusted him after the pothos incident.\n\nI get that it’s a bit silly, but it felt like a simple, clear safety solution—and frankly, after the pothos nibble, I didn’t want to risk it. I’ve since removed the label from the fake plant to dial back the joke. He’s still annoyed and says I “publicly roasted” him in front of his mom.\n\nAITA for labeling all the plants (and briefly the fake one) to prevent accidental snacking?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for putting my partner’s houseplants on a shared calendar and sending “performance reviews” when they wilt?\n self_text: I (27M) live with my partner (26F). She loves plants, but she’s also the kind of person who will set a glass down “for a second” and rediscover it in 200 years. The plants were suffering. I offered to take over watering; she said no, she wants to learn and enjoy the routine.\n\nSo I made a shared Google Calendar called “Green Team.” Each plant has a recurring event (e.g., “Fern Hydration,” “Snake Plant Check-In”), with reminders and a little note like “2 cups, avoid leaves.” I thought I was being helpful/organized/funny. I even added optional “Stretch Goal: rotate pot 90°” once a month.\n\nThe problem: I got a bit… corporate. If a plant drooped, I’d move the event to “urgent” and write a follow-up note like, “Fern is trending below Q3 photosynthesis targets. Action items: water today; review light exposure.” Once, when we were having friends over, her phone pinged with a notification that said “URGENT: Succulent post-mortem (avoidable?).” Everyone laughed. She didn’t.\n\nShe told me I’m being passive-aggressive and making her feel incompetent about something that’s supposed to be relaxing. She said the “performance reviews” and “post-mortem” language are humiliating and turning our home into a parody office. I said I was trying to help and that she’d said she wanted the responsibility, I was just nudging. She said the pings make her anxious and the tone feels condescending.\n\nFor context:\n- I genuinely thought this would be a cute system. We both work in tech and joke about sprint planning for chores.\n- I never punished her or anything; I’d just water the plant if it got too sad.\n- After the dinner incident, I changed the titles to boring ones and offered to remove her from the calendar entirely.\n- She wants the whole thing deleted and for me to stop “managing” her hobby.\n\nI feel like reminders are reasonable if the plants are dying on our shared windowsill, but I also get that I might’ve leaned too hard into the bit. AITA for creating the calendar and using worky language, or is she overreacting to something that was meant to help?\n\nEDIT TO ADD: I already apologized for the dinner ping. I can delete the calendar, but I’m worried the plants will revert to crispy. I don’t want this to be a “me vs. her vs. plants” situation.

We both work long hours, so I meal prep on Sundays. I do a pretty boring system: chicken, rice, veg, and a couple of smoothies with psyllium husk and chia for fiber because my stomach is dramatic.\n\nMy boyfriend has a habit of \"taste testing\" my food while I'm at work. It's not one bite—it's half a container here, a full smoothie there. I asked him to stop multiple times, he said he \"forgets\" or that \"we share everything,\" which we do… except the groceries for my meal prep, which I buy myself.\n\nTwo weeks ago he chugged one of my high-fiber smoothies before a client meeting and ended up glued to the bathroom. He texted me blaming me for \"spiking\" the smoothie. I told him 1) I didn't spike anything and 2) stop drinking things that aren't yours.\n\nSo last week I labeled all my containers with my name and \"Please don't eat.\" He rolled his eyes and said the labels made the fridge look like a kindergarten cubby.\n\nThis week I bought a clear fridge lockbox for my lunches and smoothies. It's literally see-through and holds just my stuff. I told him I’m happy to share dinners and anything we plan together, but my prep is off-limits because I need it for the week and it's my money.\n\nHe got annoyed and said I was being controlling and \"policing the fridge.\" He also said putting a lock in a shared space is \"hostile\" and that if I \"trusted him,\" I wouldn’t need it. I said if he respected me, I wouldn’t need it.\n\nNow a couple of his friends think I'm \"doing too much\" and that I should just make extra for him. I have made extra before, but then he still eats mine because \"yours looks better.\" I'm tired, I budget for this, and I don't want to gatekeep fiber, I just want to eat my own lunch.\n\nAITA for locking up my food?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for moving my boyfriend’s alarm across the room after weeks of him snoozing 10 times every morning?\n self_text: I (28F) live with my boyfriend (30M). For the past few months, his morning routine has been destroying my sleep. He sets four alarms starting at 6:15, then snoozes every 9 minutes until about 7:15. The alarms are loud, then he grumbles, then there’s the bed shake and phone light. I don’t need to be up until 7:30 most days.\n\nI’ve asked him (multiple times) to consolidate to fewer alarms or just set one for the time he actually needs to get up. I’ve offered solutions: a vibrating watch, a sunrise lamp, soft alarms on his side only, or even me nudging him at a single time if that helps. He always says “I’ll try,” then the next morning it’s back to the Snooze Symphony. I’ve tried earplugs and a white noise app. I still wake up with the first alarm and then lie there tense waiting for the next blast.\n\nLast week, after yet another morning of nine alarms and him still not getting up on time, I snapped. The night before, I moved his phone and alarm clock to his dresser across the room and turned off the extra alarms, leaving just one at 6:45 (the time he actually told me he needs to be up). My plan was that he’d have to physically get up to turn it off and maybe break the snooze loop.\n\nWhat happened: He woke up, got out of bed, turned the alarm off, came back to bed, and fell asleep again. He woke up late and had to rush. He was furious and said I “sabotaged” his morning and made him look bad at work. I told him I’ve been asking for a compromise for weeks and I’m exhausted. He said my sleep isn’t more important than his punctuality and I have “no right” to touch his alarms.\n\nI apologized for not telling him before I moved them, but I also said the current situation isn’t sustainable. He’s now insisting we “set boundaries,” which to him means he gets to manage his alarms however he wants and I need to “deal with it,” or go sleep on the couch.\n\nAITA for moving the alarms without a heads up? I know I shouldn’t have messed with his stuff, but I feel like I’ve tried everything short of sleeping at a hotel. What’s a fair compromise here?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for turning my relationship into a “project” with SLAs and weekly standups?\n self_text: I (30M) have been dating my girlfriend (28F) for two years. We both work in tech and were constantly missing chores, double-booking plans, and forgetting stuff like who’s grabbing the cat’s prescription. I thought I’d be helpful and set up a Notion workspace and a lightweight JIRA board for “household ops.” At first it was great—shared grocery list, a calendar for date nights, and a rotating schedule for chores. Then I got… ambitious. I added “on-call” rotations for dishes/litterbox, a simple SLA for weekday texts (2 hours), and a “change freeze” on weekends during playoffs so I could watch games without last-minute errands. When we bickered about towels, I jokingly created a meeting invite called “Retrospective: The Great Towel Incident,” and wrote a short post-mortem with action items like “ack feelings within 15 minutes” and “verify towel hooks installed.” I also made a dashboard on the TV that showed a cute burndown chart of chores and a KPI widget for “2 dates/month.” She told me she felt like a coworker, not a partner, and that I was turning our relationship into a sprint. I said data helps reduce mental load and it wasn’t about control. We argued; I said, “If we don’t measure, we can’t improve,” which sounded way worse out loud. The straw that broke it was a “Q1 Relationship Review” I wrote with categories like “Communication,” “Shared Fun,” and “Cuddles,” with comments and a 1–5 rating (I swear I put “Exceeds Expectations” on cuddles). She packed a bag to stay at her sister’s for a few days and said the whole thing is dehumanizing. I took the dashboard down and apologized, but I still feel like the structure actually helped with forgotten tasks and made things fairer. She says fair isn’t the point if it kills the vibe.

I meal prep for work because it saves money and keeps me on track. Steve keeps eating my prepped lunches. I asked him nicely to stop; he said, \"We share.\" I started labeling containers with my name and dates—he still ate them. So I escalated to more obvious labels: \"Please don't eat :)\", \"Training for a 5k—need this,\" \"Allergy meds timed with this meal.\" Still went missing. Finally I wrote \"NOT FOR YOU, STEVE\" and itemized the cost/calories. He got mad, said I embarrassed him and made him look like a child in front of his brother (who laughed). I told him if he doesn’t want to look like a child, don’t eat things clearly marked as not his. Now he’s calling me petty and controlling over “a little pasta,” and says buying mini locks for my containers is “hostile.” I’m tired of budgeting and cooking just to end up buying takeout because my food’s gone.

  "title: AITA for renaming all the furniture my boyfriend named after his exes when we had guests over?\n self_text: I (25F) moved in with my boyfriend (27M) six months ago. He has this “quirk” where he names objects in the apartment—mostly furniture—human names. Cute in theory, except a lot of them are the names of his exes.\n\nFor example, the couch is “Megan,” the reading chair is “Jess,” the bar cart is “Ana,” and the salt grinder is “Natalie.” He’ll say things like “Can you put your drink on Ana?” or “Let’s cuddle on Megan.” It makes my skin crawl. I told him early on it bothered me and asked him to change the names or at least not use ex names, and he brushed it off as “nostalgic, not romantic,” and told me I was overthinking it.\n\nWe were hosting friends for dinner last weekend. Beforehand I asked him (again) to please not call the furniture by those names while people were over because it’s awkward and makes me feel weird. He rolled his eyes and said, “It’s just a bit.” So I made little tent cards and put them on the items with new, non-person names: “Sofa,” “Reading Chair,” “Bar Cart,” “Salt.” I even threw in a couple silly ones like “Sir Sits-a-Lot” for the ottoman to keep it light.\n\nDuring dinner he said, “Can someone pass me Natalie?” I smiled and said, “You mean Salt?” and pointed to the card. People laughed. Later he tried “Grab a seat on Megan,” and I said, “The sofa is right there.” More laughs, but he got quiet.\n\nAfter everyone left, he blew up at me for “publicly undermining” him and making him look weird in his own home. He said I could have talked to him privately (I did, multiple times), and that I embarrassed him on purpose. I said I was tired of being uncomfortable in my own living room, and that naming household objects after past relationships is weird and inconsiderate when you live with a partner.\n\nNow he’s sulking and says I owe him an apology for shaming him in front of our friends. I feel like I finally set a boundary in a way he couldn’t ignore, but I admit the public aspect might’ve been petty.\n\nAITA for renaming the furniture and calling him out in front of guests?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",

He’s great except for chores—dishes stacked “to soak,” towels never hung, wet socks retired on the shower rod like flags of surrender. After months of reminders turning into arguments, I gamified chores with a soccer ref theme: yellow cards for minor fouls (crumbs on the counter, socks on the rod), red cards for bigger stuff (leaving raw-chicken cutting board out, trash overflowing). Two yellows = a red. A red means 24-hour kitchen privilege suspension and you take over laundry that day. I made a small laminated scoreboard for the fridge. Yes, there is a whistle. I also joked about VAR using our doorbell cam to verify whether someone actually rinsed a pan; I did it once when he insisted he had. He said it was “infantilizing,” but the sink has been spotless for two weeks and I’ve taken cards too (I got a yellow for leaving the oven on). The blowup: he hung sopping-wet socks on the shower rod, they dripped onto a blouse I’d steamed for a presentation, and I issued a red card plus a 24-hour ban on his favorite mug (petty, I know). Later that day our friends came by and saw the board, and one asked about his “table position.” He was mortified, said I’m humiliating him and threatened to move out if I don’t take everything down.

We split rent and groceries 50/50. I also meal prep lunches because I’m on a low-sodium plan per my doctor. I’ve told him repeatedly that those meals are specifically for me and that I portion out my sodium for the week.\n\nHe’s a grazer and will open the fridge, see something ready to eat, and grab it—even if it has my name on it. I tried:\n- Labeling containers with “OP lunch—please don’t eat.”\n- Setting aside a designated shelf with his snacks and grab-and-go stuff.\n- Verbal reminders.\n\nIt kept happening. Last week I printed simple QR codes that link to a Google Doc called “NOT YOUR LUNCH (medical diet)” with the date range and a note: “If this isn’t yours, please don’t eat—replacement cost listed if you do.” I put them on my containers because he told me the labels “blend in” and he forgets. He said the QR codes were “kind of extra” and “infantilizing,” but I figured it would remove all doubt in the moment.\n\nYesterday, he ate one of my prepped lunches anyway. When I asked why, he said he was in a rush and “figured one wouldn’t matter.” It does matter because I plan ingredients and sodium totals for the week. I didn’t have a backup and ended up grabbing takeout, which threw off my plan and budget.\n\nSo I sent him a Venmo request for the listed replacement cost ($18—covers the chicken, veggies, and rice portion for two lunches plus the extra takeout I had to buy because mine was gone). He refused and said I was being petty and controlling. I told him I’m not trying to punish him; I just need my food to be there when I go to eat it, and if he eats it after all the labeling and me explaining why, he should replace it.\n\nHe’s now sulking and telling our friends I “charge him to live in his own house.” For the record, I don’t care if he eats shared groceries or anything I cook for both of us. This is specifically about the medical-diet meal prep I’ve repeatedly asked him not to touch. I’m not trying to be his mom; I just want my lunches to survive the week.\n\nAITA for using QR codes and sending a Venmo request when he ate my meal prep again?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for turning my wife's passive-aggressive sticky notes into formal museum plaques around the house?\n self_text: Me 31M, wife 29F. She leaves sticky notes around the house for things I historically forget: \"Rinse blender,\" \"No metal pan in dishwasher,\" \"Return scissors,\" \"Wipe stove.\" We've been working on it. I thought the fluorescent notes made the house look like a crime scene. For our anniversary I joked I'd make her \"classy signage.\" She laughed at the idea then moved on. A week later, while she was visiting her sister, I replaced six sticky notes with small brushed-brass plaques (Etsy, about $60 total): \"Please rinse the blender,\" \"Wooden spoons are hand-wash only,\" etc., in a friendly font with little icons. I also actually followed the instructions for a month. House looks neater; I'm remembering more. Problem: We hosted friends and a few people found the plaques hilarious. One called our kitchen \"the Museum of My Husband’s Habits.\" My wife smiled then later said it felt like I turned her legitimate frustrations into a joke that invites comment.

Whenever I brought it up casually, it turned into a rushed “we’ll figure it out later.” So I did what I do at work: I sent a Google Calendar invite titled “Q3 Romance Sync (Action Items + Roadmap)” for Sunday afternoon at a cafe, with an agenda in the description: chores division, date night cadence, phones during dinner, intimacy check-in. I even marked it “high priority” and added a goofy note about KPIs being “number of hugs per day” because I thought humor would make it less intimidating. He accepted the invite, but when we met he was visibly annoyed. He said I was making our relationship feel like a job and that it was condescending to “manage” him. I explained that this is just how my brain works (I’m a project manager), and if it isn’t on the calendar, it often doesn’t happen. The meeting actually worked: we agreed he’ll handle trash/vet appointments, I’ll do meal planning, we’ll both put phones away during dinner, and we’ll plan two date nights a month. But afterward he told me he still feels icky about being “scheduled” and that if love needs a roadmap, maybe we’re not compatible. I genuinely wasn’t trying to be cold or controlling; I was trying to create structure so we stop arguing and make time for each other.

Unexpected item in bagging area. It’s a cucumber, Brenda, the most expected item in the vegetable area. I remove it. Beep. Place item in bagging area. I place it. Beep. Remove plastic bag from scale. There is no plastic bag. I am the plastic bag. Beep.\n\nAn associate materializes from the Mist of Management, brandishing a handheld scanner like a wizard staff. “Need help?” he asks.

Would you like to join Produce Team? Options: YES. Also YES.\n\nI press YES because it’s green and so is the cucumber and frankly I trust color-coded destiny. Instantly a mini printer screams out a nine-foot receipt that is actually a contract, a riddle, and an onboarding PowerPoint. “Congratulations,” the associate intones, pinning a vest onto my soul. “You are now Assistant Regional Manager of Produce.” The vest says Produce Lason (Trainee) but the confidence says Manager.\n\nMy first task: deliver a motivational speech to the onions. I tell them that layers are not weakness; they are redundancy. They weep because that’s their brand. The tomatoes begin a slow clap. The potatoes do not move but I sense respect in their starch.\n\nThe self-checkout chimes again: REMOVE PLASTIC BAG FROM SCALE. I realize it is not a command; it is a mantra. I whisper it.

I meal prep because I work late and have dietary restrictions. I label my containers and we’ve had multiple talks about not eating them—he always apologizes but then “forgets.” Last week he ate my clearly labeled chili, so I petty-prepped: I made him his own batch and wrote FOR RACCOONS ONLY on the lid as a joke/reminder.

He told me I was “publicly shaming” him and being controlling about food in a shared home. I said I’m not controlling—I just want my own meals to be there when I get home. He says labeling his food like that makes me an AH and that if I wanted more respect I should “ask nicely,” which… I’ve done, many times.

  "title: AITA for labeling everything in my kitchen after my boyfriend kept \"forgetting\" where things go?\n self_text: I (28F) moved in with my boyfriend (30M) six months ago. We generally get along great, but the kitchen has become a battleground. I cook most nights and like a simple system: spices on one shelf, baking stuff together, knives in the block, reusable containers with their lids nearby, etc.\n\nHe insists he “puts things away where they make sense in the moment.” That has meant oregano in the tea bin, plastic wrap with the pots, a cutting board under the bathroom sink (???), and my favorite chef’s knife “drying” in the oven. I’ve had to go on 10-minute scavenger hunts mid-recipe just to find salt or a measuring cup. Food has gone bad because I couldn’t find leftovers until they were a science project.\n\nWe talked about it multiple times. I asked if he’d be willing to follow a simple layout; he said sure, but kept slipping back to “my system is just more intuitive.” So I bought a label maker. I labeled shelves (“Pasta/Rice,” “Canned Goods,” “Baking”), drawers (“Measuring Cups,” “Utensils”), and containers (“Flour,” “Sugar”). It took an hour on a Sunday. It wasn’t snarky—no “For people who can’t follow directions”—just plain labels. I even made a little “Lids live here” bin.\n\nFor a week, bliss. Everything was exactly where it should be. Then his friends came over for game night. One of them joked, “Bro, your kitchen is set up like a kindergarten classroom,” and they laughed. I laughed too, because honestly… it did look very organized. My boyfriend went quiet and then got mad after they left, saying I’d “childproofed the home” and embarrassed him. He said I should have taken the labels down before hosting because it made him look incompetent.\n\nI told him the labels weren’t for guests; they were for living like functional adults and not spending half our evenings hunting for a sieve. If he follows the system, I’ll happily remove them once it sticks. He says the labels make the house feel “sterile” and that I “weaponized a label maker” to make a point at his expense.\n\nI feel like I tried communicating, compromising, and finding a solution that literally harms no one.

  "title: AITA for naming all my girlfriend’s houseplants “Fred” so I could keep track of them?\n self_text: I (29M) recently moved in with my girlfriend (28F), who has approximately 27 houseplants. They are everywhere. Windowsills, bookshelves, the shower, hanging from the ceiling like leafy chandeliers. I offered to help with watering because she works long shifts and sometimes forgets, and she said yes.\n\nHere’s the problem: I could not tell them apart. There are three identical-looking trailing things (pothos? philodendron? ivy?) and two succulents that might actually be rocks. I kept asking, “Which one gets water on Tuesdays?” and she’d say, “The philodendron.” That did not help me.\n\nSo I made little plant tags and wrote names on them. But to keep it simple, I named every plant Fred. Different last names to differentiate. Examples:\n- Fred Pothos\n- Fred O. Dendron\n- Fred Aloe Vera Bradley\n- Fred Leaf Erickson\n- Fred Fernando\n- Fred Spiky Mike (I panicked)\nI also made a tiny spreadsheet with watering schedules: “Fred Pothos (kitchen)” every 7 days, “Fred Aloe (office)” every 21 days, etc. I was honestly proud of myself.\n\nMy girlfriend came home, saw the labeled Fred army, and got upset. She said naming is something special to her and that by naming them all the same thing, I’d made her plants into a joke and taken away their individuality. She also said the spreadsheet and the reminder I set on our shared calendar (“Fred Check-In”) made the plants feel “corporate.”\n\nI tried to explain the Fred system wasn’t a joke; it was the only way I could remember without mixing them up. One name theme = less confusion. I even offered to change some last names if she wanted. She said I should just remove the labels and delete the spreadsheet because she misses the “vibe.” I said I’d rather keep the labels so I don’t accidentally drown Rock Fred.\n\nIt escalated when I left a sticky note that said “Q2 Growth Review: Fred Fernando exceeded expectations.” I thought it was funny; she did not. She said I’m not respecting her space and that I’m making plant care about me. I feel like I’m trying to be helpful and also very carefully not killing Freds.\n\nNow she’s giving me the cold shoulder and hand-watering them silently while removing the tags.

I’m 28F and I do most of the cooking because I genuinely enjoy it and it helps me decompress after work. The issue is my boyfriend has a compulsion to add cinnamon to basically anything savory the moment I turn my back.\n\nI’m not anti-cinnamon. I use it in baking and sometimes in stews where it actually makes sense. But he’ll sneak it into tomato sauce, scrambled eggs, chili, even ramen. I’ve asked him nicely to please stop “fixing” my food after I plate it, and if he wants cinnamon he can put it on his portion. He agreed… for about a week.\n\nIt escalated at a small dinner we hosted last weekend. I made a lemon-garlic chicken pasta with capers. While I was refilling water in the kitchen, I came back to find him hovering over the pan shaking cinnamon like it owed him money. The whole kitchen smelled like a spice candle. I tried to salvage it, but it was basically dessert pasta.\n\nI was mortified and we ended up ordering pizza. Our friends didn’t say anything, but it was awkward. After everyone left, I told him I felt disrespected and asked why he did it. He said his mom always added “a pinch of cinnamon to balance acidity” and he was just helping. I said great, but I didn’t ask for help and it ruined the dish.\n\nTwo days later I came home with a small lockable toolbox (think tackle box) and put my spices in it. I left out basic salt/pepper and a small jar of cinnamon clearly labeled with his name so he could use it on his own food. I told him I’m not trying to control him, I’m trying to protect the meal I’m cooking from uninvited tweaks. He called it “insane and controlling,” said I made him look like a child, and that I embarrassed him in front of our friends by “overreacting.”\n\nFor what it’s worth, I’ve tried:\n- Asking him to wait until his plate is served to add whatever he wants (he agrees, then forgets).\n- Offering to let him pick recipes or cook with me (he says cooking stresses him out).\n- Prepping a small “his spice blend” jar with cinnamon and nutmeg he can sprinkle on his portion (he says it’s not the same if it’s not bloomed in the pan… which requires adding it to the whole pan).\n\nHe’s now sulking, and his mom texted me that her “pinch of cinnamon trick” is a family tradition and that I’m being “territorial about a kitchen I don’t own” (we split rent). I told her that traditions are fine but I’m not obligated to serve dessert bolognese to guests.\n\nAITA for locking up the spices until the meal is served?

He’s a project manager and literally schedules everything. Dinner with friends? Calendar. Laundry? Calendar. Watering his plants? Calendar. He’s not flaky, just… structured.\n\nThe problem is he’s missed a bunch of things with me because “it wasn’t on my calendar.” Dates, my sister’s art show, even a small weekend getaway we talked about. When I got frustrated, he said, “Babe, I’m not trying to ignore you. If it matters, put it on my calendar.”\n\nSo I did. I sent highly professional invites: “HOLD: Quality Time (Cuddles/Tea/No Phones),” “Stakeholder Meeting: Feelings,” and “Sprint Retro: What We Enjoyed This Week.” I included agendas like “10 min check-in, 30 min activity, 15 min dessert,” action items (“bring cozy socks”), and even color-coding so it wouldn’t conflict with his meetings. It sounds silly, but he actually started showing up on time and being really present. He even joked the first week that my “status updates” were cute.\n\nFast forward to last Friday. One of my invites apparently popped up during his team’s stand-up because he had his personal and work calendars synced. The invite title was “Backlog Grooming: Kissing + Board Game” (which I realize sounds worse to people who don’t know Agile). He said a couple coworkers snickered, his boss made a “work-life balance” joke, and he was mortified.\n\nHe came home upset and said I “undermined his professional image” and disrespected boundaries. I apologized for the embarrassment but said I only used his personal calendar. I didn’t know it synced to his work. He said I should have known because he’d mentioned syncing “everything,” but I genuinely didn’t clock that meant titles would broadcast during meetings. I offered to switch to vague titles like “Personal Appointment” and keep the rest in the notes, or stop using calendar invites altogether—if he could please stop using “not on my calendar” as a reason to miss things. He said that was manipulative and that if I need time, I should just “ask like a normal person.”\n\nFrom my perspective, I did ask. Repeatedly. He told me to use the tool that works for him, and it worked until the one hiccup. From his perspective, I publicly embarrassed him and made our relationship “content” on his schedule.\n\nMy friends are split. Some say he’s weaponizing structure to avoid responsibility and I just met him where he was. Others say I should have been more discreet, because “Stakeholder Meeting: Feelings” is… a choice.\n\nAITA for calendar-inviting my boyfriend to our own relationship?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for implementing a chore points \"rewards program\" for my husband after months of arguments about housework?\n self_text: Me (F29) and my husband (M31) both work full-time. We’ve been together 6 years, married 1, living in a small apartment with a dog. We’ve argued on and off for months about housework. He says “Just tell me what you want done and I’ll do it,” but when I ask, it’s often “in a bit,” and then hours or days pass and I end up doing it.\n\nI tried talking, lists, a shared calendar, even a Saturday “reset” hour. None of it stuck. So two weeks ago I made a chore points “rewards program” because he’s super into achievements in video games and fantasy football. I assigned points to chores (e.g., dishes = 10, vacuum = 15, laundry start-to-finish = 30, dog bath = 25). We both can earn points. At certain thresholds, you get small rewards (picker’s choice for takeout, I make your favorite breakfast, you pick the weekend activity, etc.). It’s funded from our joint “fun” budget we already had. I made sure nothing intimate/affection-based was tied to points because that felt gross. I also put in “streak bonuses” for doing the same task consistently and a “boss fight” once a week (deep clean the bathroom together, 50 points each). I tracked it with a silly magnet board on the fridge.\n\nAt first he laughed and did a few chores, then blew it off. When he saw I had more points after a few days, he got really irritated and said I was “gamifying our marriage” and treating him like a child. He especially hated that I gave negative points for leaving a wet towel on the bed and for letting the trash overflow (I called them “turnovers,” -5 each). He said it was punitive and I was trying to “manage” him.\n\nI pointed out that the system applies to me too (I lost points twice for leaving shoes out), and it’s literally just the chore list with a dopamine sticker. Also, he said he wanted me to tell him what to do; now it’s clear, visible, and we both get perks. He said if I have to bribe him to participate in our home, something is wrong, and that the scoreboard is embarrassing and transactional.\n\nWe had a stupid fight, I took the board down to keep the peace, and—shock—everything slid again. I feel like I tried a lighthearted solution that didn’t cost extra money, didn’t tie anything inappropriate to chores, and was meant to make it fair and even fun. He says I’m making the house feel like a classroom and that I should “trust him to step up without a chart.” But months of trusting didn’t work.\n\nAITA for trying to turn chores into a points-and-rewards system when regular communication wasn’t working?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for renaming our Wi-Fi to “Please Empty The Dishwasher” every time my boyfriend ignores chore texts?\n self_text: My boyfriend (28M) and I (27F) moved in together 9 months ago and split chores 50/50 on paper. In reality, he “forgets” unless I remind him. Texts get left on read, sticky notes are “nagging,” and calendar invites are “too corporate.” After the third time I came home to a sink mountain and a clean dishwasher, I changed our Wi-Fi name to “Please Empty The Dishwasher.” He emptied it in 10 minutes. So I started updating the SSID as needed: “Trash Night Is Tonight,” “Laundry Out Of Washer NOW,” “If You See A Sock, Pick It Up.” It honestly worked better than any other method. The problem is his friends noticed when they came over for game night, and his raid buddies saw the network name on screenshots/streams. He says I humiliated him and “weaponized the internet,” calling it controlling and petty. I argued it’s our shared Wi-Fi, I’m not locking him out, and I only change it when reminders go ignored. He’s demanding I apologize and stop “broadcasting our private business.” I think it was a funny, effective nudge after nicer attempts failed. AITA?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for setting \"office hours\" for my roommate because he keeps interrupting me while I WFH?\n self_text: I (29M) work fully remote. My roommate (30M) is between jobs and is home most days. I work out of my bedroom with the door closed, have multiple client calls, and really need uninterrupted blocks of time to focus.\n\nAt first it was small stuff: knock-knock, “Got a minute?” to ask if I’d seen the spatula, to tell me a meme, to ask if I could sign for a package, to see if I wanted coffee, to “quickly” help him move a bookshelf. It added up. I told him nicely a few times that during work hours (9–5) I can’t be interrupted unless it’s an emergency, but after a couple days the interruptions crept back in.\n\nSo I tried a more structured approach. I put a simple sign on my door with two windows: “Available” (green) and “Do Not Disturb” (red). I also set “office hours” where I promised I’d be available for non-urgent stuff: 12:30–1:00 for lunch chat and 5:00–5:30 after I log off. I told him if he needs something urgent (like a leak or fire), knock loudly and I’ll come. Otherwise, please wait for the green sign or office hours. I also offered to help him set up delivery preferences and text me ahead if a package needs a signature so I can plan around it.\n\nHe laughed and called it “corporate roommate,” but agreed to try. For two days it was great. Then last week, he knocked three times during a client presentation to ask if he could borrow my HDMI cable. I didn’t answer because the red sign was up and I was literally presenting. He got annoyed that I “ignored” him. Later, an Amazon delivery required a signature; he knocked while I was on another call; I didn’t answer; the driver left a notice. He was angry and said my “fake office rules” caused him to miss a replacement keyboard he needed.\n\nI reminded him I’d said to text me before delivery windows so I can be ready, or he can sign up for the “no signature” option. He said I’m being petty and treating him like a subordinate in his own home, and that if I want that level of control I should rent an office. For context: we split rent 50/50, both have equal use of common areas. I work from my room and only use the living room occasionally for calls (I always ask first). I’ve offered to buy him a $10 HDMI cable and cover a coworking day pass for him once a week so he can have space too.\n\nI genuinely don’t think “please don’t knock while the red sign is up unless the apartment is on fire” is unreasonable. He thinks I’m an AH for “making up rules” and not answering the door for his stuff. AITA for enforcing office hours and not responding to non-urgent knocks during work?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for turning chores into a \"level-up\" game and refusing to take down the scoreboard when my boyfriend said it made him feel like a child?\n self_text: I (28F) moved in with my boyfriend (30M) three months ago. We both work full-time and were struggling to keep up with chores. In my last apartment, my roommates and I used a goofy chore board that \"gamified\" tasks. You got XP for doing dishes, vacuuming, etc., and when you hit certain levels, you picked a small reward (like choosing the Friday takeout or getting a fancy coffee on the other person). It sounds silly, but it actually kept things fair and light.\n\nI set up a new version in our place: a whiteboard in the kitchen titled \"Household Hero Quest.\" It's got tasks with points, a little doodle of a sword and sponge, and level names like \"Dust Paladin\" and \"Vacuum Wizard.\" We tried it for two weeks, and things genuinely improved. Dishes were done, laundry didn’t pile up, and neither of us had to nag. I even caught him smiling the first time he hit \"Level 2: Mop Mage.\"\n\nThe issue started when we had some friends over for a game night. They noticed the board, laughed (not maliciously, just kind of amused), and made a couple of jokes like \"Congrats on your promotion to Sponge Knight.\" My boyfriend got quiet and later told me the board made him feel infantilized and embarrassed. He said it felt like I was \"managing\" him instead of being partners, and that seeing it in the kitchen was patronizing. He asked me to take it down.\n\nI suggested we keep it but move it into the pantry door, where it’s hidden unless you open it. I also offered to rename the levels to something more neutral (like \"Tier 1, Tier 2\") or switch to a shared app if he was just worried about guests seeing it. He said the whole concept bothers him because it turns us into \"points and prizes\" instead of communicating like adults. I told him this is exactly us communicating: it sets expectations and keeps things fair without resentment.\n\nHe said I was being stubborn and controlling by refusing to just take it down, especially after he said it made him feel bad. I said I don’t want to backslide into doing 70% of the chores again and that the system was working. Now he’s giving me the cold shoulder and said he’ll \"do chores when they need doing,\" which is… exactly what we tried before and it didn’t work.\n\nFor what it’s worth, I do not weaponize the board. I don’t shame him for low points. If anything, I’ve been chasing my own points more. I genuinely think it’s a playful accountability tool, and I was willing to compromise on the visibility and language. He says if I respected him, I’d just remove it and trust him.\n\nAITA for refusing to take down the chore scoreboard?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",

  "title: AITA for leaving \"parking tickets\" on my girlfriend's shoes when she parks them in the hallway?\n self_text: My girlfriend and I share a small apartment with a narrow hallway that leads from the front door to the living room. She often kicks off her shoes right in the middle of the hallway, which means I either sidestep like a ninja or stub my toe like a cartoon dad. We’ve talked about it a few times, I bought a small shoe rack by the door, and she uses it… sometimes. After the third late-night toe-stub, I made “Department of Hallway Transit” tickets (sticky notes) with silly codes like “H-01: Unmetered High-Traffic Zone” and a $0 fine. If a shoe got a ticket, I’d move it to the rack. I even ticketed myself once when I left my gym bag out. She says it’s passive-aggressive and makes her feel infantilized. I told her it’s meant to be a light reminder and a way to laugh about a recurring problem; I offered to stop if we set a clear “drop zone” and both stick to it. Things blew up when her friend saw a ticket on a boot and joked about it—GF was embarrassed and said I’m controlling. Now she wants an apology and a promise I’ll never “ticket” again, and says sometimes shoes end up there after long days. I get that, but I’m tired of playing hallway hopscotch at midnight.

  "title: I bought eggs and accidentally became the CEO of Breakfast\n self_text: I went to the store to buy eggs like a normal, tax-paying, bipedal human. The carton said “Grade A Large” which felt judgmental, but I accepted the performance review. The cashier asked, “Do you want a receipt?” I said, “No, I’ll remember,” which is the funniest lie I’ve told this year. I left with twelve oval promises of potential, feeling powerful and slightly calcium-rich.\n\nAt home I placed the carton on the counter and suddenly the air changed like a PowerPoint transition. The fridge hummed in a keynote tone. One egg rolled forward as spokesperson. “Congratulations,” it whispered in cholesterol, “you are now CEO of Breakfast.” Before I could protest, a rooster named Greg slid a tiny briefcase under the door. Inside: a mission statement that just said “Sizzle.”\n\nNow my mornings have quarterly omelette calls. We discuss yolk utilization, toast throughput, and jam synergy. I allocate resources: 60% scramble, 30% sunny-side, 10% R&D (experimental frittata). The toaster beeps in stock ticker Morse, the coffee negotiates a merger with my circadian rhythm, and the spatula union demands nonstick benefits. I ring the skillet like the opening bell and people clap somewhere, probably the bacon.\n\nThe eggs keep offering promotions if I “think outside the shell,” which is rich coming from eggs. Yesterday HR (Hot Resources) told me my performance is over-easy but trending poached. I countered with hash brown options and equity (extra quick syrupity), which is not even a thing but the pancake board loved it.\n\nAnyway, if you see me in Aisle 12 wearing a tie made of bacon, don’t ask for a promotion.

My manager asked how I did it and I said I held the “Resume” button until the printer remembered its childhood and chose a different path. Now the coffee machine has sent me a LinkedIn request and endorsed me for “Descaling.” My stapler has allergies. Excel crashed because I typed “=SUM(vibes)” and the vibes were non-numeric. HR says I owe PTO because I took a mental vacation to the break room without submitting a postcard. The office microwave requires a four-digit PIN and two-factor snacking. The wall clock refuses to hit 5:00 PM without a calendar invite and a quorum of sighs. I submitted an IT ticket and the ticket replied with feedback on my posture. I’m mentoring the Roomba on emotional boundaries but it keeps bumping into flags, many of which are red. I set my status to “heads down” and everyone asked why I was wearing a snorkel. The whiteboard ghosted me after I erased its boundaries. I tried to leave early but the door asked for two weeks’ notice and a knowledge transfer on how to jiggle the handle.

  "title: AITA for putting a tiny bell on my boyfriend’s snack shelf to catch who’s been stealing my food?\n self_text: I (28F) live with my boyfriend (30M). We agreed that we each buy our own treats and the other person asks before taking any. Despite that, my yogurts and cereal bars kept disappearing. He swore it wasn’t him and joked that I must be sleep-eating or that we had “snack poltergeists.” After labeling everything and even designating separate shelves, stuff still went missing. So I put a little craft bell on the inside of the pantry shelf where we keep snacks. If you open it, it jingles. Yesterday he was on a work call, opened the pantry, and the bell jingled. I said, “Oh, that’s the bell I set up to catch the snack thief,” not realizing he was unmuted. His coworkers heard the jingling and someone joked about Santa arriving. He looked mortified, wrapped up the call, and later told me I set a “trap” to humiliate him, that it’s controlling and childish, and now his team thinks he’s weird. I said I’m not trying to control him, I’m trying to protect food I paid for after talking didn’t work, and the bell cost $1 and solved the mystery.

I work long shifts and I meal prep on Sundays so I don’t end up surviving on stale pretzels and coffee. The meal prep is labeled, stacked, and honestly the neatest part of my life.\n\nHe has a habit of “forgetting” and grabbing one “in an emergency” which somehow happens 3–4 times a week. I’ve asked him to stop, gave him a designated shelf, put my name on containers, and even bought him his own snacks. He nods, apologizes, and then the next week I open my lunch bag at work to find vibes and disappointment.\n\nAfter the third time in a row, I got… creative. I turned the fridge into a tiny museum. I printed little placards and taped them below each container (“Exhibit A: Tuesday’s Lemon Chicken. Medium: Tupperware. Artist: Hungry Me.”). I strung a piece of red yarn like a velvet rope across my shelf. I even made a QR code that links to a 20-second audio guide of me saying, “Please enjoy this exhibit with your eyes only.” It was silly, I admit, but I figured humor might make the boundary stick.\n\nHe laughed at first. Then his friends came over for a game night. One of them opened the fridge and started doing the tour voice: “Ah yes, a rare yogurt in its natural habitat.” Everyone laughed. My boyfriend went quiet. After they left, he said I humiliated him, that treating him like a child is controlling, and that if I had a problem I should have just talked to him (I did, multiple times).\n\nI pointed out that I’ve tried calm conversations, labels, designated shelves, buying extra snacks. I spend hours meal prepping and money on groceries. I don’t want to fight; I just want to eat what I made. I told him I’m fine sharing if he tells me in advance, but not when it leaves me short at work. He said I owe him an apology for making a spectacle and that he only grabbed them because he’s “bad at breakfast” and “forgets to shop.”\n\nI offered a solution: I’ll prep 2 extra portions weekly just for him if he buys the extra ingredients, or he can set a reminder to shop. He said the “museum thing” made it a point of pride now and he’s “not engaging with that.”\n\nFor context: We split rent and utilities 50/50, groceries separately. He has access to my meals only when I offer. He doesn’t have dietary restrictions. I don’t police what he eats otherwise.

It actually worked for a week—things were labeled and people wrote cute notes. Last night Jake came home hangry, tried to grab my curry without saying anything, and I said “ticket, please.” He rolled his eyes, I held the jump rope, he called me insufferable and took it anyway.
