  "title: What exactly was the dial-up modem “scream” doing—were those tones actually carrying data or just the handshake?\n self_text: I grew up on AOL discs and that unholy modem orchestra, but I never actually understood what I was hearing.

  "title: ELI5: Why did dial‑up Internet sound like a robot screeching and chirping? What exactly was happening during that “handshake”?\n self_text: I’m old enough to remember clicking “Connect,” the modem dialing a number, and then the iconic BEEEEP-kssshhhh-dee-doo-dee-doo-cha-chirp before a page loaded one pixel at a time. I always wondered what that noise actually was.\n\n- Were those sounds literally the two modems sending test tones to agree on speed, error correction, and compression? Like, is each chirp a different “test” (signal-to-noise check, echo cancellation, etc.)?\n- Why was it audible to us—was my computer just playing the line audio through a tiny speaker, or is that the actual data on the phone line in the voice frequency range?\n- Why did picking up another handset nuke the connection?\n- Could you tell the final speed (28.8/33.6/56k) by the pattern of sounds, or is that a myth?\n- If I played a recording of a handshake into the line, would that ever work, or does each session negotiate unique details so a recording wouldn’t match?\n- Why was download faster than upload on 56k, and why did it require the ISP to be “digital on one end”?\n- Why did the noise stop after the handshake—were they using similar tones silently after, or a different modulation that we just didn’t hear?\n\nWould love a big‑picture, kid-friendly explanation and any fun “what each chirp means” breakdowns.

  "title: AITA for telling my boyfriend that if the dishes aren’t done within 24 hours, I’m not cooking for both of us anymore?\n self_text: I (29F) live with my boyfriend (31M). When we moved in last year we agreed on a division of labor: I cook dinner, he handles dishes. I like cooking and he hates cooking, and he said he preferred cleaning anyway, so it felt fair.\n\nThe problem is he doesn’t actually do the dishes the same night—or the next day. It often turns into a 2–3 day “soaking” situation. He leaves pans with water and a drop of soap and says he’ll get to it “tomorrow,” but tomorrow turns into “this weekend,” and by then the sink is full, stuff smells, and I can’t cook because there’s nowhere to prep or wash anything. Then I either end up cleaning “just enough” to make dinner (which snowballs into me doing half the dishes) or we order out, which isn’t in the budget.\n\nWe’ve tried solutions:\n- I started pre-rinsing and scraping so he’d only have to load the dishwasher/wash a couple pans.\n- We bought a better scrubber and dish gloves.\n- I set a reminder on his phone (at his request).\n- We tried “we clean together on weeknights” but he’d be “too tired after work” and promise to make it up on Saturday. Saturday comes and… football, errands, friends, etc.\n\nFor context, we both work full-time desk jobs, similar hours. I also grocery shop and plan meals; he takes out trash and does vacuuming. The one thing I really need in return for cooking most nights is that the kitchen gets reset so I can actually cook again the next day.\n\nLast week, after stepping around a swampy baking tray for the third day, I told him I needed a firm boundary: if the dishes from dinner aren’t done within 24 hours, I’m not cooking for both of us until the kitchen is usable again. That means I’ll make myself something simple (eggs, salad, microwave stuff) and he can handle his own food until the backlog is cleared. I’m not punishing him—I just can’t keep cooking when the sink and counters are unusable.\n\nHe got upset and said I’m “weaponizing food” and being petty. He argues he does eventually do the dishes and that I’m “making it a control thing” by setting a timer. He also says sometimes he genuinely needs to decompress after work and doesn’t want to immediately jump into scrubbing pans, which I get—but the delay keeps becoming days, not hours.\n\nI don’t think it’s crazy to ask that dishes get handled within 24 hours of the meal, especially when that’s the only way the cooking/cleaning split works. I’m not asking him to do more; I’m asking him to do the thing he already agreed to, in a timeframe that lets me keep doing my part.\n\nAITA for drawing that line and not cooking for both of us if the dishes aren’t done within a day?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: Why do non-English URLs turn into “xn--” gibberish when I paste them? Is that normal/safe?\n self_text: A friend sent me a legit-looking site in Cyrillic (it was something like кафе.рф). In the chat/app it shows up in the native script, but when I copy/paste it into a text editor or see it in my browser’s address bar, it becomes xn--something-long.tld.\n\nWhat’s actually happening under the hood here? Is that just how the internet stores non-Latin domain names? How do browsers decide when to show the pretty native characters vs the “xn--” version?\n\nAlso, is there a security angle I should worry about? I’ve heard of “homograph” phishing where letters from other alphabets look like English ones (like an a that’s not really an a). How do I tell if a link is legit? Do HTTPS certs show the real domain in a reliable way, and is there an easy way to check this on mobile?\n\nFinally, why do some apps (Discord/Slack/email clients) show the native script while others auto-convert to the xn-- form?

  "title: Why did dial‑up internet make that screechy “EEEE-brrr-kkkshhh” sound, what was happening during it, and could a dial‑up modem still work today?\n self_text: I only ever heard the dial‑up noise in memes and old movies. What was actually going on during that sound—were the modems “negotiating” speeds and error‑correction, or was it literally the data? Were there specific standards (V.34, V.90/V.92) that correspond to the different chirps/tones?\n\nAlso, why did we hear it out loud? Was the noise necessary, or just the modem’s tiny speaker letting you hear dial tone/ring/busy/handshake for debugging?\n\nIf I found a 56k modem and plugged it into a modern phone line, would it still connect to anything in 2025? Do ISPs still have dial‑up numbers? Would VoIP lines (like the phone port on a cable modem) break it unless you use a certain codec? Could two modems call each other directly for a point‑to‑point link?\n\nAnd related: why did picking up the handset—or getting a call‑waiting beep—instantly murder the connection?

  "title: Why did dial-up make the “bee-doo-screee” noise and could techs tell the speed just by listening?\n self_text: I grew up with the AOL handshake from the other room: a couple of quiet beeps, then the “bee-doo bee-doo,” then a long screechy hiss. Was any of that meant for humans at all, or purely the modem talking to the ISP?

  "title: AITA for installing a fridge lockbox after my roommate kept \"sampling\" my meal prep?\nself_text: I (29F) live with one roommate (30M). We split rent and utilities evenly and agreed early on that staples (oil, spices, condiments) are shared, but actual groceries and anything meal-prepped/portioned is personal. I’m lactose intolerant and have a couple dietary restrictions, so meal prepping on Sundays keeps me from ordering takeout and accidentally eating something that wrecks my stomach.\n\nThe issue: my roommate has a habit of “sampling.” It started with a spoonful of my yogurt here and there (“I was just tasting it”), a couple slices of my prepped chicken (“I needed protein for the gym”), a “borrowed” energy drink when he was running late. Every time, he promised to Venmo me or replace it. Either it didn’t happen, or he’d replace my lactose-free yogurt with the regular stuff, which I can’t eat. I got sick once from not noticing he’d swapped the containers.\n\nI brought it up calmly multiple times. We even wrote it down in our house notes app: shared vs. personal, label your stuff, ask before taking anything that’s clearly someone else’s. He agreed. He still kept doing it. His excuses were always “I forgot,” “I was starving,” “It was just a tiny bit.”\n\nTwo weeks ago, I meal prepped five lunches and four dinners. By Wednesday, two lunches were gone and one dinner had a chunk missing. I confronted him and he said he was “in a bulk phase” and “thought food was for the house because it was in the house.” I told him I’m not his mom or his meal service.\n\nSo I bought a clear fridge lockbox that sits on a shelf and holds my prepped containers. You can see what’s inside but it locks with a combo. I put my name on it and messaged him the change, with a reminder that staples are still shared, and he’s welcome to use fridge space outside the box as usual.\n\nHe blew up. He said it makes the kitchen “hostile,” joked that I put my food in “jail,” and complained that his friends saw it and thought I was “controlling.” He asked for the code “so I can put something in there,” which… no? It’s literally the whole point. He accused me of “not trusting him” and said I’m treating him like a child. I pointed out the only reason I bought it is because he kept taking my stuff after multiple conversations.\n\nWe asked a couple mutual friends. Responses were split: some said it’s my food and my money, so protecting it is reasonable; others said a lockbox is “dramatic” and makes the place feel tense. Roommate says if I don’t like sharing, I should get a mini-fridge for my room. I said he’s free to get one if he doesn’t like seeing the lockbox; I’m not moving appliances into my bedroom because he can’t not eat my lunch.\n\nFor context: I do most of the kitchen cleaning (he’ll do dishes if asked, but I’m the one wiping counters and taking out trash without prompting). I’m not policing his food, his guests, or his schedule. I just want to reliably eat the meals I cooked for myself without getting sick or spending extra money because my “tiny bites” keep vanishing.\n\nI told him the lockbox stays until we go a month without any more “samples.” He said that’s unrealistic because he “forgets” when he’s hungry. That… kind of proved my point to me.\n\nAITA for putting my food in a lockbox in the shared fridge?\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: ELI5: Why do fridges beep when the door is open—saving power, protecting the compressor, or something else?\n self_text: Newer fridges nag you with a chime if the door is left open for ~30–60 seconds. My old one from the 90s didn’t, and friends’ models seem to vary wildly (some barely chirp, others sound like a smoke alarm at 3 a.m.). What’s the real reason these alarms exist?\n\n- Is it primarily an energy thing (keep cold air in), or is there an actual mechanical/food-safety reason (protect the compressor from overworking, prevent frost/ice from humid air, keep temps in the safe zone)?\n- Are they triggered by a simple magnetic/reed door switch and a timer, or do some use temperature sensors to decide when to beep?\n- Why do different brands have different delays/volumes—any standards or regulations behind this?\n- Does leaving the door cracked for a few minutes actually hurt the fridge in any way, or is it just wasting electricity and warming food?\n- Bonus: for energy use, is it better to keep the door open once while you load groceries, or open/close it multiple times?\n\nWould love a “how it works” breakdown from fridge techs/engineers.

  "title: ELI5: What were the dial-up modem screeching sounds actually doing, and could you really tell the speed by ear?\n self_text: I grew up with the AOL scream and I’m curious what those noises meant in plain terms.\n\n- Step by step, what was happening during the sequence? (dial tone/DTMF, ring, the steady carrier tone, then the chirps/hisses/warbles)\n- Were the modems basically negotiating the protocol (V.34/V.90), error correction (V.42), and compression (V.42bis), and testing the line to pick a speed?\n- Why did it sometimes connect at 56k and other times fall back to like 28.8 or 33.6—was that just line noise the handshake picked up?\n- Could experienced users really “hear” a good vs bad connection and predict the speed? (I remember people claiming they could.)\n- Why do fax machines sound so similar—are they using related standards?\n- And why did the sounds vanish with DSL/cable—was it because the modem stopped routing the analog handshake to our speakers, or do those connections just work differently?\n\nELI5 if possible, but I’m happy with a “kid-friendly but accurate” breakdown.

  "title: AITA for refusing to be the “default dishwasher” when my boyfriend cooks because he says it’s “fair” since he buys the groceries?\n self_text: I (27F) live with my boyfriend “J” (29M). We’ve been together 3 years, living together 8 months. We split rent 50/50. We both work full-time; my hours can run late.\n\nWhen we moved in, we agreed on a simple system: whoever cooks doesn’t do dishes that night. It worked when meals were simple. In the last few months J got super into “chef era” meals—multi-course, lots of pans/gadgets. Think: two skillets, a stock pot, sheet pan, blender, multiple mixing bowls, plus every spice on the counter. I’m not exaggerating when I say some nights it’s a full sink plus counters covered.\n\nHere’s the friction: J now says because he “buys the groceries,” it’s only fair I do the cleanup when he cooks. For context, we split staples/groceries with a joint budget. He sometimes buys pricier specialty ingredients with his own card (steak, fancy mushrooms), but I still pay half of the regular weekly haul. I also do most laundry and take the dog out in the mornings; he takes trash/recycling.\n\nI asked to either go back to our original deal (cook doesn’t clean) or at least set some boundaries: clean as you go, cap the number of pans, or we alternate cleanup nights regardless of who cooks. He says “clean as you go kills the vibe” and that my doing dishes is me “contributing” since he’s “contributing” by cooking and spending on ingredients.\n\nTwo weeks ago he made a big dinner on a night I worked late. I came home to Mount Dishmore and a text: “Your turn to clean :) I’m hopping online with the boys.” I was exhausted and left it for the morning. He was mad, said leaving dishes overnight is gross, and that I’m being petty. I said I’m done being the default dishwasher when he chooses to use every pan in the house. If he wants to cook elaborate meals, great, but either he cleans or we simplify.\n\nHe accused me of “devaluing his passion” and said I’m focusing on “time spent” while ignoring that he spends more “money and effort” than I do. I pointed out I still pay for half our regular groceries and the utilities that power the dishwasher, and that elaborate =/= automatic exemption from cleanup.\n\nNow he’s cold-shouldering and telling friends I “refuse to support his hobby,” which feels unfair because I’m not asking him to stop cooking—just to stop assuming I’ll do hours of cleanup every time. He says it’s common sense that if one partner cooks, the other cleans, but that rule breaks down when “cooking” becomes a 2-hour, 10-pan operation four nights a week.\n\nAITA for setting a boundary that I won’t be the default dishwasher for his chef nights unless we go back to alternating fairly or he cleans as he goes?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: Why do some non‑Latin URLs show as “normal” text while others turn into xn‑‑punycode, and can I force my browser to always show punycode to avoid homograph phishing?\n self_text: I fell down a rabbit hole about IDN/homograph attacks (like domains using Cyrillic “а” instead of Latin “a”). In Chrome/Firefox/Safari I’ve noticed that sometimes a link with non‑Latin characters displays in the address bar as the nice Unicode text, but other times it shows the xn‑‑punycode version.

He says he “doesn’t see” mess the way I do and that I’m “more particular,” so it’s not fair to expect his timeline to match mine.\n\nLast week I burned out and changed tactics: I bought compostable paper plates/bowls, designated one nonstick pan and one pot as “mine,” and started making ultra-simple one-pan meals I can wash immediately in under 2 minutes. If there’s a pile of his dishes, I just don’t touch them. If my pan is clean, I cook; if not, we do leftovers or he can figure out dinner. If neither option works, we do takeout (from our discretionary budgets, not groceries).\n\nHe’s upset, says I’m “punishing” him, wasting money, and creating trash. I pointed out the plates are compostable, and that this setup simply removes the bottleneck where I get trapped doing his chore. I also offered to switch: he cooks, I clean. He declined, saying he’s “not good at cooking” and that takeout is “healthier than my stress cooking” (??). He wants me to go back to normal dinners and promises he’ll “do better,” but I’ve heard that before.\n\nI don’t want a roommate dynamic; I want a partner. But I also don’t want to keep enabling a system where the only way we eat is if I do my job and then bail him out on his.

  "title: AITA for setting a “late cancellation” fee when my brother backs out of babysitting last-minute?\n self_text: I (29F) am a single mom to a 4-year-old. My brother (33M) is child-free and works from home. About six months ago he said he wanted to be “more involved” and offered to babysit occasionally so I could take shifts (I’m an ER tech) or have an evening off. We agreed that I’d ask him first before booking my usual sitter because family time is good and, honestly, the help is appreciated.\n\nThis has turned into a pattern where he’ll enthusiastically say yes, and then cancel a few hours to a day beforehand because of “something that came up”: a last-minute dinner, a weekend invite, a friend in town, etc. In the last 10 times he agreed, he canceled 5 of them with less than 24 hours’ notice. Twice it forced me to give up shifts I really needed, and three times I scrambled to find an emergency sitter at a premium rate plus paying for their Lyft because of the late hour. It adds up and it’s stressful.\n\nAfter the fourth cancellation I told him I needed reliability more than spontaneity. I offered two options:\n1) No hard feelings, I just won’t ask him to babysit anymore.\n2) If he wants to be my “first call,” then if he cancels within 24 hours, he reimburses the difference between my usual sitter’s rate and the last-minute rate (and transportation if it’s late and I have to cover their ride). If he cancels with more than 24 hours’ notice, no problem.\n\nI felt like that was fair and transparent. He said he still wanted to help and that the policy was “fine.”\n\nLast weekend, he agreed to watch my kid Saturday evening so I could take a 6-hour shift. Saturday afternoon he texts that he got invited to a cabin night and “I’ll make it up to you next time.” I couldn’t lose the shift, so I scrambled and found a sitter who charges $30/hour for last-minute weekend bookings, plus $20 each way for a ride because she doesn’t drive. My usual sitter is $18/hour. So the difference + rides came to $140.\n\nI sent my brother a polite Venmo request with a note: “Per cancellation policy — difference in sitter + rides.” He declined it and called me, saying I was being “cold and transactional with family” and that he’s not a “service provider.” I reminded him I literally offered him the option to bow out entirely and he chose to keep being my first call. He said I should “have backup plans that aren’t extorting your own brother.”\n\nNow my parents are involved, saying “family helps family” and I shouldn’t “invoice” him. I told them family also keeps their word, and I have a kid and bills — I can’t keep eating costs because he wants to be spontaneous.\n\nFrom my side: I gave a clear boundary and an out. I’m not charging him for babysitting; I’m asking him to cover the extra costs created by his last-minute cancellation that he agreed to avoid. I also value my brother and don’t want this to be a cold transaction — I just need predictability.\n\nFrom his side: He probably feels like he’s trying to be helpful when he can and doesn’t want to feel punished for saying yes and then life happening.\n\nAITA for treating this like a cancellation policy instead of “that’s what family is for”?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",

It doesn’t seem to care whether the door is open a crack vs. wide open, or if the room is cold vs. hot—it’s just a timer.\n\nIs that really how most fridges work (a magnet/reed switch + microcontroller on a fixed countdown), or do any models actually look at compartment temperature or airflow and alarm when it’s meaningfully warming up?

  "title: AITA for tagging our dishes with QR codes and a “three strikes” system after months of sink stalemates?\n self_text: I (28M) live in a 4-person apartment with two roommates (27M “Jake,” 25F “Maya”) and my partner (27F). We all get along fine, except for one thing that has slowly made me a crazy person: the sink.\n\nFor context, we don’t have a dishwasher. The sink routinely becomes a science experiment. I’m not talking one mug; I mean oily pans, fork forests, and a strata of cereal bowls fossilized in oat milk. We’ve tried: a rotating schedule, a “wash your own within 24 hours” rule, a group chat reminder, and even putting a timer on the counter. It would work for a week and then we’d revert.\n\nI work from home and cook a lot, but I’m willing to clean if people just don’t leave stuff for days. Maya is in healthcare and sometimes has 12–16 hour shifts. I get that. Jake works 9–5 and then games until late most nights. My partner is neat and usually cleans as she goes.\n\nAfter the third moldy sponge this summer, I proposed something I thought was nerdy but fair: a low-tech accountability system. I bought tiny QR code stickers (the ones you’d put on a notebook) and stuck them on the handles/bottoms of commonly used shared items: the two big pans, a few plates, the cutting board, etc. I also made a simple Google Form that logs “what item” and “time scanned” to a sheet.\n\nHouse rule we agreed in the group chat (and everyone thumbs-upped): if you leave a shared item dirty in the sink past 24 hours, when you finally wash it, you scan the code yourself and mark “was over 24h.” If you truly can’t get to it because of an emergency or long shift, no problem; there’s a “grace” option. If someone else finds a dish clearly past 24 hours, they can scan “unclaimed past 24h” so it doesn’t get lost. Three “past 24h” logs in a rolling month = you buy a house pizza. Reset monthly. It’s silly, but I figured a small, tangible consequence would do what polite texts don’t.\n\nI made exceptions clear: Maya got a 48-hour grace because of her shift patterns. Personal items (your own mugs, Tupperware) weren’t part of it unless they blocked the sink. No one had to put their name on anything; it wasn’t tracking people, just items. No cameras. No location data. Just… a sticker that opens a form.\n\nFirst couple of weeks? Magical. The sink was visibly better. My partner and I had zero strikes. Maya had one “grace” after a brutal weekend and appreciated that it wasn’t a thing. Jake got two strikes in week one. Both were the big skillet “soaking” for days. He said he forgot. I reminded him, he shrugged.\n\nWeek three, Jake hit strike three (again the skillet and a cutting board). I posted in the group chat: “Not trying to be annoying, but the sheet shows 3 past-24h logs this month. Pizza night?” He immediately called me a “spreadsheet hall monitor,” said I was turning the apartment into a surveillance state over dishes, and that the QR codes were “creepy.” He also said my “three strikes” was biased because he cooks more, so he gets more opportunities to get strikes.\n\nI pushed back: this only applies to shared items left longer than a day, not every time you cook. If you wash after you use it, no strike. If it’s soaking because something is seriously stuck, you can log that and it won’t count. I even offered to reset the month clean if we all recommit.\n\nHe doubled down, refused to buy pizza, and now leaves passive-aggressive notes like “QR THIS” on Post-its next to the sink. Maya privately told me she likes the system because it’s objective and she feels bad when the sink is gross. My partner says the system is fine but I should drop the pizza penalty and go back to gentle reminders to “keep the peace.”\n\nI genuinely don’t think I’m spying on anyone. The sheet doesn’t name names unless people self-report, and it’s literally only logging “this pan sat dirty for 2+ days.” If anything, I thought making it a goofy game would defuse tension. But I’ll admit I’m the one who implemented it and I’m the one following up, so I might look like I’m policing adults.\n\nAITA for implementing the QR code system and expecting Jake to follow the agreed-upon “three strikes = buy pizza” rule? Or is this unreasonably petty/controlling and I should just accept that the sink will always be chaos?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",

  "title: Why do fridges randomly beep in the middle of the night if nobody opened them? Is it just a defrost cycle causing a false “door ajar/high temp” alarm?\n self_text: Apartment fridge (top-freezer, ~5–7 years old) will sometimes start beeping around 2–4 a.m. The door is fully shut, seals look fine, temps are normal by morning, and the beeping stops if I open/close the door once. It happens maybe a few times a month and almost never during the day.\n\nWhat exactly are these alarms usually monitoring—door-ajar switch, high temperature, power blip memory, something with the ice maker? And why does it seem to happen at night?\n\nMy guesses:\n- Defrost cycle briefly warms the compartment enough to trip a temp alarm, especially when the fridge is relatively empty (low thermal mass).\n- Cooler nighttime room temps change the gasket or cabinet enough to momentarily “unseat” the magnetic door switch.\n- Warm air stratification near the top sensor makes the reading spike until the fan/compressor evens it out.\n- Tiny power flickers overnight cause a “power loss” beep later.\n\nAre any of these actually likely? If it’s the defrost/temperature alarm, would adding thermal mass (water jugs), cleaning coils, or slightly lowering the setpoint help? If it’s the door switch/gasket, is there a non-destructive way to test or shim it without just disabling the alarm? Curious what the common root cause is and the simplest fix that doesn’t involve living with random 3 a.m. fridge screeches.\n subreddit: NoStupidQuestions",

Was the computer literally encoding data into audible frequencies and playing them over the phone line, or was the speaker just monitoring something the modem was doing anyway?\n\nIf it was “real” data in sound form, could someone who knew what they were listening to tell the connection speed or protocol (like V.34 vs V.90) just by ear?

Is that a security/phishing setting?\n- Are there rules to stop confusing lookalike mixes (e.g., Latin “a” vs Cyrillic “а”) or mixing scripts in one domain?\n- Do older routers/DNS resolvers choke on this, or is the conversion all client-side so it “just works” everywhere?\n- Are email addresses with non‑Latin characters handled the same way, or is that a different system?\n\nI don’t need an RFC‑level answer—just a clear mental model of the steps from “I click the pretty Unicode domain” to “a server answers,” and how modern browsers try to keep us safe from homograph shenanigans. My lizard brain says “this looks sus; don’t click,” but I’m guessing there’s a sane process behind it.\n subreddit: NoStupidQuestions",
  "title: AITA for unplugging the fridge at 3AM because the door alarm wouldn’t shut up?\n self_text: I (28F) live with three roommates. We share an old-ish fridge with one of those door-ajar alarms. It’s super sensitive: if the door is even slightly off because someone crammed leftovers on the door shelf, it starts doing a high-pitched beep every 10 seconds that you can hear from bedrooms.\n\nThis has been an ongoing issue. The seal gets blocked by takeout containers in the door, and the alarm triggers even when the door looks “closed.” I’ve asked in the group chat a few times to stop overpacking the door and to leave enough space so the seal actually seats. We’ve also talked about either replacing the fridge, rearranging shelves, or disabling the alarm, but nothing happened because “it still works.”\n\nLast night around 3AM the alarm started going off. I got up, moved stuff around, tried to re-seat the seal, even leveled the front feet a little. It would stop for a minute and then start again. I pinged the chat and knocked on the two roommates’ doors who were up late earlier (the ones who usually overpack the door), but no answer.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes, I was wide awake and getting increasingly anxious because I have a 7AM shift. I didn’t want to wedge the door open (worse for temp), and I didn’t know where the little sensor was to tape it. So I unplugged the fridge, set a 25-minute timer, and left the door closed. When my timer went off, I plugged it back in, checked the interior temp with a cheap fridge thermometer we keep on the middle shelf (it read 39°F), and the alarm was silent. I fell asleep.\n\nThis morning, one roommate was furious. She said I put everyone’s food at risk, and that “touching other people’s appliances” without permission is a huge boundary issue. She claims I should have just kept trying to wake people or tried harder to fix the seal. I said I did try, and that a brief power-off in the middle of the night with the door closed isn’t going to spoil anything, especially since the fridge was still in safe range when I checked. Also, repeatedly ignoring the alarm and overpacking the door is what caused the problem.\n\nFor context:\n- We’ve had this exact alarm-beeping situation maybe 6–7 times in the last few months.\n- I’ve cleaned the gasket, rearranged shelves, and put a note on the door before. It helps for a bit, then back to chaos.\n- We split utilities and groceries partially, but everyone also has personal items in there.\n\nI get that unplugging someone else’s stuff can feel like a line crossed. At the same time, I feel like sleep is a basic need and I took a temporary, practical step after trying other fixes. No food spoiled and I restored power within half an hour.\n\nAITA for unplugging the fridge so I could sleep, or is the real issue that my roommates keep causing the alarm by overstuffing it and ignoring it when it goes off?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: How do URLs with non‑Latin characters (emoji/Cyrillic/etc.) actually work—does DNS handle Unicode or is the browser faking it?\n self_text: I keep seeing domains or links with emoji or non‑Latin characters; sometimes my browser shows them as \"xn--\" punycode, other times it percent‑encodes stuff in the path. What’s the actual split between what DNS understands (IDNs) vs what’s just URL encoding in the path/query? How do browsers decide when to display native characters vs punycode (homograph protection?), and do TLDs have rules about which scripts or emoji are allowed? Also, any practical downsides (certs, email deliverability, SEO, phishing filters) to using these?\n subreddit: r/NoStupidQuestions",
  "title: What was the dial-up modem “screech” actually doing? Could you literally hear the data?\n self_text: I grew up with 56k and that chaotic robot song still lives rent‑free in my head. What was happening in those sounds, step by step?\n\n- Was each phase of the noise a different part of the handshake (negotiating speed, error correction, compression)?\n- Were those tones literally the data, or just the setup to agree on how to send data after?\n- Why was it audible at all—was it just using the same frequency range as human speech because it ran over phone lines?\n- Did different brands/standards (v.90/v.92, 28.8 vs 56k) have different “melodies,” and could an expert tell them apart by ear?\n- Why did picking up another phone or a call‑waiting beep nuke the connection?\n- Why were uploads slower than downloads on 56k?\n- And what changed with DSL/cable so we stopped hearing any of this?\n\nCurious for an ELI5-ish explanation—bonus points if you can map the classic sequence (static → chirps → screech → silence) to what the modems were actually agreeing on.\n subreddit: NoStupidQuestions"
