  "title: Micro-stutters every ~20 seconds despite high FPS — what am I missing?\nself_text: Hey all, I’m getting weird micro-stutters/hitches in a bunch of games even when FPS is solid. You can see it in camera pans and traversal: the frame-time spikes every ~10–20 seconds, lasts a split second, then back to smooth. It’s not a massive drop, just a noticeable hitch.\n\nSpecs:\n- Ryzen 5 5600 (stock)\n- RTX 3060 Ti (stock)\n- 16GB (2x8) DDR4-3200 CL16 (XMP on)\n- B550 board (latest BIOS)\n- 1TB NVMe Gen3 (OS + games), 2TB SATA SSD (games)\n- Windows 11 Home 23H2\n- 1440p 144Hz IPS (G-SYNC Compatible), DisplayPort\n\nTemps are fine (CPU <70C, GPU <75C), usage looks normal, no thermal throttling.\n\nTried so far:\n- DDU + clean install latest NVIDIA drivers\n- G-SYNC Compatible on/off, V-Sync on/off (NVCP vs in-game), Fast Sync, frame cap to 141, tried uncapped\n- Low Latency Mode On/Ultra, Reflex in supporting games\n- HAGS on/off, Game Mode on/off\n- Disabled overlays (GeForce/Steam/Discord), Xbox Game Bar off\n- Latest AMD chipset drivers, fresh Windows install (last month)\n- SAM/Resizable BAR on/off\n- Checked RAM with MemTest (no errors)\n- Disabled MPO via registry, re-enabled to test (no change)\n- HPET on/off test, set system timer defaults\n- fTPM stutter fix BIOS option (tried enabled/disabled) — no change\n- High Performance power plan, min/max CPU states adjusted\n- Background apps trimmed, MSI Afterburner/RTSS off\n- Swapped DP cable (but both are Amazon basics)… could this still be a cable issue?\n\nGames affected: Apex, Cyberpunk, Valhalla, Destiny 2, OW2. Weirdly, smaller indies feel fine.\n\nQuestions:\n- For VRR + 144Hz, is best practice G-SYNC (NVCP) ON + V-Sync ON (NVCP) + in-game V-Sync OFF + frame cap to ~141?\n- Could a cheap DP 1.2/1.4 cable cause periodic hitches (not blackouts)? Any brand recs?\n- Should I bump to 32GB for newer titles (pagefile spikes)? Pagefile currently system managed.\n- Any B550 BIOS settings I should double-check (CPPC, Global C-States, Spread Spectrum, etc.)?\n- Anyone fix periodic spikes by disabling MPO permanently or tweaking NVCP Low Latency/Max Frame Rate combos?\n\nOpen to any rabbit holes I missed.

  "title: Random USB disconnects during gaming — power issue or drivers?\nself_text: Hey all, hoping for some guidance. Lately my USB devices will randomly disconnect/reconnect while I’m gaming. I hear the Windows device connect sound, my controller drops for a second, sometimes the keyboard freezes for 1–2 seconds, and I’ll occasionally get a “USB device not recognized” toast. It almost never happens at idle, mostly under GPU load.\n\nSpecs:\n- CPU: Ryzen 7 3700X\n- GPU: RTX 3070 (MSI)\n- Mobo: MSI B450 Tomahawk Max (latest BIOS)\n- RAM: 32GB DDR4-3200\n- PSU: EVGA SuperNova G3 650W (about 5 years old)\n- OS: Windows 11 Pro 22H2\n- Peripherals: USB DAC (powered by USB), keyboard, mouse, Xbox controller (wired), webcam\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n- Moved devices between rear IO and front case ports, tried a powered USB 3.0 hub\n- Updated AMD chipset drivers, GPU drivers, BIOS, Windows\n- Disabled USB selective suspend and unchecked “Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power” on hubs in Device Manager\n- Switched power plans and tested with DAC unplugged\n- Checked temps (CPU/GPU are fine), reseated GPU and checked all power connectors\n\nIt feels like a 5V rail droop or motherboard USB flakiness that shows up under load. Is a 650W G3 borderline for a 3700X + 3070 these days (especially as the PSU ages)? Would you try:\n- Replacing the PSU first\n- Adding a PCIe USB expansion card\n- Sticking to a good powered hub and avoiding mobo ports\n- Anything MSI B450-specific I should look at (firmware/known issues)?\n\nAlso, any specific Event Viewer logs I should check to confirm if it’s power vs driver?

  "title: 3440x1440 upgrade path from GTX 1080 — GPU first or whole platform?\n self_text: Hello all, I just picked up a 34\" ultrawide (3440x1440, 144 Hz) and my trusty GTX 1080 is officially out of gas. Trying to decide if I should drop in a new GPU now or bite the bullet and do a platform upgrade too.  Current rig: - CPU: i7-8700K (stock, Z370) - RAM: 16 GB (2x8) DDR4-3200 - GPU: GTX 1080 8 GB - PSU: EVGA SuperNOVA G2 650W (80+ Gold) - Storage: 1 TB SATA SSD + 2 TB HDD - Case/Cooling: Fractal Define R5, decent airflow  Games: Cyberpunk 2077, Starfield, Apex, BG3, a bit of MSFS. I’m fine with High/Ultra mix and prefer smoothness over maxed sliders. I do like RT when it’s practical, but not a must-have.  Budget: ~$800–$1,000 for GPU right now. Could do a CPU/mobo/RAM refresh in 6–12 months if it’s worth waiting.  Questions: - For 3440x1440, would a 4070 Ti Super or 7900 XT be the sweet spot? Any reason to stretch to a 4080 Super/7900 XTX? - How much will my 8700K bottleneck at this resolution in those games? Is it “good enough” for a while if I’m mostly GPU-bound? - Is my 650W G2 sufficient for a 4070 Ti Super or 7900 XT (with a sensible power limit/undervolt)? - If I decide to do a stopgap CPU, is a cheap jump to a 5800X3D platform still sensible in 2025, or should I save for AM5 (7800X3D/9700X3D eventually)? - Any gotchas with case length/adapter clearance for these cards in a Define R5?  Goal is to get a noticeable uplift now for the new monitor without wasting money. Appreciate any real-world experiences or “wish I’d done X instead” advice!\n subreddit: buildapc",

  "title: Undervolting disabled after BIOS update on XPS 15 9570 — any safe workaround?\n self_text: I have a Dell XPS 15 9570 (i7-8750H, GTX 1050 Ti Max-Q, 16GB, 512GB) that I’ve kept cool for years with a small undervolt via ThrottleStop/XTU (-125mV core/cache). I recently updated the BIOS (went from 1.12.x to 1.23.x) and now voltage controls are greyed out in both XTU and ThrottleStop. Temps went up ~10-12°C under load and I’m getting more frequent thermal throttling in games/compiles.\n\nThings I’ve tried/checked:\n- XTU says “Voltage control: Unsupported,” ThrottleStop sliders are locked.\n- BIOS has no obvious option to re-enable undervolting (no “Overclocking Feature” to toggle).\n- Dell BIOS downgrade is blocked (“BIOS update blocked due to capsule authentication”).\n- Cleaned fans, replaced thermal paste last year (Thermal Grizzly), repasted again yesterday—helped a little but still worse than with undervolt.\n- Set PL1/PL2 in ThrottleStop, tweaked Speed Shift EPP, limited turbo multipliers—still hotter/noisier.\n\nQuestions:\n- Is there any safe way to re-enable undervolting on this gen after the Plundervolt microcode (e.g., specific BIOS version that still allows it, or a legitimate Dell-supported rollback path)?\n- Has anyone successfully rolled back the 9570 BIOS recently without bricking (BIOS recovery method, Service Mode jumper, or using an older .exe via command line flags)?\n- Any non-undervolt tuning tips that actually helped (advanced fan curves, IMON tweaks, disabling AVX turbo, etc.)?\n- If undervolting is dead on this machine, what’s the best combo of PL1/PL2 and EPP for a quiet-but-snappy setup?\n\nWould prefer to avoid sketchy BIOS mods.

  "title: 5600X + RX 6800 on B450 Tomahawk Max — BIOS/PSU/compatibility check?\nself_text: Hey all, looking for a meaningful GPU/CPU bump without rebuilding the whole rig. Hoping to sanity-check parts and gotchas before I pull the trigger.\n\nCurrent build:\n- CPU: Ryzen 5 2600 (stock)\n- Mobo: MSI B450 Tomahawk Max (BIOS is… old, pretty sure pre-Zen 3)\n- RAM: 16GB (2x8) DDR4-3200 CL16\n- GPU: GTX 1660 Super\n- Storage: 1TB SATA SSD + 512GB NVMe (PCIe 3.0)\n- PSU: EVGA 550 G3 (550W, 80+ Gold)\n- Case: Fractal Meshify C with 2x front intake, 1x rear exhaust\n- Monitor: 1440p 144Hz\n\nUpgrade plan (budget ~ $650–$750 total):\n- CPU: Ryzen 5 5600X (or 5700X if price is close)\n- GPU: Radeon RX 6800 16GB (or 7700 XT if the price/availability makes more sense)\n\nQuestions:\n1) BIOS: Can I drop a 5600X/5700X onto the Tomahawk Max after flashing to the latest BIOS, or do I need to step through specific BIOS versions? Anyone recently do this exact combo?\n2) PSU: Is my EVGA 550 G3 enough for a 5600X + RX 6800 at 1440p, or should I plan for a 650–750W upgrade? I’d prefer not to swap the PSU unless it’s a real risk.\n3) PCIe/Resizable BAR: The B450 is PCIe 3.0 — is the RX 6800 noticeably bandwidth-limited at 1440p? Also, is SAM/Resizable BAR worth enabling on this board/CPU, and does MSI support it well on B450?\n4) Cooling: Is the 5600X fine on the stock cooler in a Meshify C, or should I grab a cheap 120/240 AIO or a midrange air cooler (e.g., Fuma 2, AK620)?\n5) Alternatives: Would a 5700X be a better long-term pick if it’s within ~$30–$40? And is the 7700 XT close enough to the RX 6800 at 1440p to justify going newer (AV1, drivers), or is the 6800 still the better value if I find a good used price?\n\nUse case: Cyberpunk, Starfield, Apex, Baldur’s Gate 3 at 1440p high/ultra, aiming for smooth 60–100+ FPS. Not concerned with RT; raster perf matters most.\n\nAppreciate any advice, especially from folks on B450 who’ve done this upgrade path!\nsubreddit: buildapc",

HWInfo reports fan ~3200–3500 RPM even when CPU package power is <2W.\n\nQuestions:\n1) Is this a known quirk with the latest T480 BIOS/EC? Anyone else seeing higher baseline fan speeds?\n2) Is it safe to roll back BIOS on the T480, and if so, what’s the recommended process (and which version behaves best)? I see talk of Secure Rollback Prevention — do I need to toggle anything first?\n3) For the coil whine: normal for this model, or should I suspect the NVMe drive? It changes a bit with brightness and light CPU spikes.\n\nAppreciate any tips or a known-good BIOS/EC combo. I love this machine and would rather not have the fan droning all day for no reason.

With two front 140s installed, does a 313–320 mm 7800 XT actually fit without moving to 120 mm front fans or pulling the front-bottom fan?\n2) Airflow: For this case, is 2x140 front + 1x120 rear fine, or should I go 3x120 front for better pressure/clearance? Worth adding 1–2x 120 mm top exhausts or will that flip pressure and increase dust?\n3) PSU: Is the RM650e sufficient for a 7800 XT + 12400F (1 NVMe + 2 SATA drives), assuming a light undervolt on the GPU? Some AIBs “recommend” 700 W—real-world input appreciated.\n4) Thermals/undervolt: Any 7800 XT owners with hotspot temp and fan-curve results in a similar airflow setup? Recommended undervolt targets (mV/freq) that don’t hurt performance too much?\n5) Support bracket: With a ~2.5–2.7 slot 7800 XT, should I plan on a simple support bracket to avoid sag in the NR400?\n6) Filters: The NR400’s front filter is pretty tight—did anyone see meaningful temp drops swapping to lower restriction mesh or just running front filter cleaned frequently?\n\nThanks in advance! I’d love to keep the NR400 if this is all workable, but I’ll pivot to a roomier case if it’s going to be a headache.\n subreddit: buildapc",

Is this just normal coil whine or should I be worried about my PSU?\n\nSymptoms:\n- Loudest in game menus and at 300+ FPS\n- Gets quieter if I enable V-Sync/FPS cap\n- Present even when I alt-tab (but quieter)\n- Not present on desktop at idle\n\nTroubleshooting I tried:\n- Different wall outlet/surge protector\n- Toggling PCIe Gen 3 vs 4 in BIOS\n- Undervolting the GPU slightly\n- New DP cable\n- Moving case farther from me\n- Ran OCCT PSU and GPU tests: stable, no errors\n\nSpecs:\n- CPU: Ryzen 5 5600X (Noctua U12S)\n- GPU: Gigabyte RTX 4070 Ti Gaming OC\n- Mobo: MSI B550 Tomahawk\n- RAM: 32GB DDR4-3600\n- PSU: EVGA SuperNOVA 650 G3 (650W, ~3.5 years old)\n- Case: Fractal Meshify C\n- Monitor: 1440p 144Hz\n\nQuestions:\n1) Is 650W enough for this card/CPU combo or is it borderline and causing noise?\n2) If it’s coil whine, is there anything practical I can do beyond RMA/fps caps (e.g., burn-in)?\n3) Could the PSU be the source even if voltages seem fine under load?\n\nWould appreciate any advice before I go down the RMA/PSU replacement rabbit hole.

  "title: 1440p 165Hz upgrade: 4070 Super now, or CPU/Mobo/RAM first?\nself_text: Hey all, looking for a smart upgrade path that won’t nuke my budget.\n\nCurrent rig:\n- CPU: Ryzen 5 2600\n- Mobo: ASUS ROG Strix B450-F Gaming\n- RAM: 16GB (2x8) DDR4-3200\n- GPU: RTX 2060\n- PSU: Thermaltake 650W 80+ Gold (semi-modular)\n- Storage: 1TB NVMe + 2TB SATA SSD\n- Monitor: 1440p 165Hz (G-Sync Compatible)\n\nGames: MW3/Warzone, Apex, Fortnite, Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, a little Starfield.\n\nGoal: reliably hit 100–165 FPS at 1440p on high/ultra without constant CPU stutter in shooters.\n\nOptions I’m weighing:\n- GPU-first: RTX 4070 Super (or RX 7800 XT to save $$), keep the 2600 for now. Will the 2600 be too much of a bottleneck in CPU-heavy shooters at 1440p, even with DLSS/FG?\n- Cheap CPU drop-in: Grab a Ryzen 5 5600 or 5700X on the B450 (BIOS update), then upgrade GPU later. Is this the best bang-for-buck stopgap?\n- Full platform jump: AM5 (7600/7700) + B650 + 32GB DDR5 now, stick with the 2060 for a bit, and do GPU later. Worth it for smoother 1% lows vs staying on AM4?\n\nBudget: $700–$900 total for this round. I’d prefer to stretch value, so the staggered path is appealing.\n\nOther qs:\n- Is my 650W good enough for a 4070 Super (plus a 5600/5700X later)? Any gotchas on connectors?\n- For the 5700X on B450-F, any VRM/BIOS quirks I should know about?\n- If I go 7800 XT instead of 4070S, am I trading away too much in RT/DLSS for my use case?\n- Micro Center AM5 bundles worth it right now, or still better value to stay AM4 + big GPU?\n\nThanks in advance—trying to avoid a sideways upgrade or mismatched parts.\nsubreddit: buildapc",
  "title: PSU sizing and model advice for GPU upgrade (1440p)\nself_text: Hey all, looking for some sanity checks before I pull the trigger on a PSU upgrade.\n\nCurrent build:\n- CPU: Ryzen 5 5600 (stock)\n- GPU: RTX 2060\n- Mobo: B550 ATX\n- RAM: 32GB DDR4\n- Storage: 1x NVMe + 2x SATA SSD + 1x HDD\n- Case: Meshify C (good airflow)\n- PSU: Corsair CX550M (2019)\n\nUse case: 1440p gaming at 144 Hz (mix of shooters and single-player), mild CPU undervolt/eco mode, no heavy overclocking.\n\nPlanned GPU upgrade: either RTX 4070 or RX 7800 XT in the next month or two. I’d like to swap the PSU first so I’m not pushing my luck with the CX550M.\n\nQuestions:\n- Is 650W Gold enough for either card, or should I go 750W to be safe?\n- Worth paying a bit extra for ATX 3.0/PCIe 5.0 with a native 12VHPWR cable for future proofing, or fine to stick with tried-and-true 8-pin units?\n- Any specific model recs under $120-ish?\n\nShortlist I’m eyeing:\n- Corsair RM750e (2023)\n- Seasonic Focus GX-750\n- Super Flower Leadex III Gold 750\n- EVGA SuperNOVA G6 750\n\nAlso open to 650W variants if that’s truly sufficient.
