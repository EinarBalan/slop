  "title: {Air cooler vs AIO in warm rooms: what’s actually quieter for a 1440p gaming/editing build?}\n self_text: {Planning a new build (Fractal North XL mesh) aimed at 1440p 144Hz gaming and light Premiere/DaVinci work. Debating a dual-tower air cooler (Fuma 3/NH-D15/Assassin IV) vs a 240/280mm AIO. Priorities: low noise at idle and under sustained load, minimal maintenance, decent RAM clearance, and reliability. Room can hit 28-30°C in summer; PC runs 8-10 hours/day. CPU candidates are 7800X3D or 13700K/14700K. For folks who’ve tried both setups recently, how do your temps and perceived noise compare during gaming and longer renders? Any long-term issues like pump whine, evaporation, or fan bearing noise worth calling out? Would you ever choose a 360mm AIO in a mid-tower over the best air coolers, or is the real-world gap basically gone? Bonus tips on fan curves or case choices that make either option shine are welcome.}\n subreddit: {buildapc}",

Questions: Is the 5800X3D still the smartest play at 1440p or will AM5 + frame gen age better? For a 7900 XT, is my RM650x enough or should I grab a 750–850 W unit? Any BIOS gotchas moving a B450 Tomahawk MAX to 5800X3D? For VRR and upscaling, how do your experiences compare between 4070 Super (DLSS 3, better RT) and 7900 XT (more VRAM, FSR 3 improvements)?

  "title: First SFF build check: 7800X3D + RTX 4070 Super in NR200P — cooler clearance, riser, and PSU questions\n self_text: Putting together my first small-form-factor build and would love a sanity check plus thermal/airflow advice. Planned parts: Cooler Master NR200P (using the mesh side panel), Ryzen 7 7800X3D, Scythe Fuma 2 Rev.B (154.5 mm height), B650-I ITX board, 32 GB DDR5-6000 CL30, RTX 4070 Super (2.5-slot ~267 mm), Corsair SF750 (750 W SFX), 2 TB NVMe (SN850X). Questions: 1) Is the SF750 enough headroom for this combo, or worth stretching to an 850 W SFX for transient spikes? 2) Fuma 2 should fit under the NR200P’s 155 mm limit—any gotchas with RAM clearance or side panel bowing I should know about? 3) If I go vertical GPU, do I need to buy a PCIe 4.0 riser for best performance on a 4070 Super, or is the included riser sufficient? 4) Best fan layout for a quiet profile: thinking 2x bottom 120 mm intake for the GPU, 2x top 120 mm exhaust, rear 92 mm exhaust—does that sound right, or is side intake with the mesh panel better? 5) Any tips for undervolting the 7800X3D and 4070 Super in this case to keep temps/noise down?

Use case is 1440p/144Hz gaming and some light video editing. Questions: 1) Is a quality 750W PSU enough for this combo with some OC/undervolt headroom, or should I step up to 850W for quieter fan curves and future GPU upgrades? 2) For airflow, is two 140mm front intake + one 120mm rear exhaust sufficient, or should I add a top exhaust for better VRM/GPU temps while still keeping slight positive pressure? 3) For RAM, is DDR5-6000 CL30 still the sweet spot for 7800X3D, or would CL32/CL36 be fine in practice? 4) Any reason to pay extra for B650E over B650 if I don’t care about PCIe 5.0 GPU slots and only need one NVMe drive? 5) Any gotchas with these specific boards/cases/coolers (clearance, AM5 backplate quirks, BIOS settings like EXPO/PBO to watch out for)?

  "title: Is 32GB RAM the new baseline for mid-range gaming builds in 2025?\n self_text: For folks building $1k–$1.5k gaming PCs, is it time to default to 32GB, or is 16GB still fine if you’re not heavy on mods/streaming? I’m seeing newer titles + Chrome/Discord eat 12–14GB, and some games (Starfield, TLOU, Flight Sim) hitch with 16GB even on DDR5. On the flip side, 2×16GB DDR5-6000 CL30 kits are pretty affordable now, but they can push some B650/Z790 boards harder on stability. If you’ve built recently, what’s your real-world RAM usage at 1440p? Any issues with EXPO/XMP at 6000–6400? Also curious whether people regret 2×8GB or if the jump to 2×16GB was worth it for future-proofing. Bonus: would you prioritize 32GB over a slightly better GPU tier (e.g., 4070 Ti Super vs 4070) if the budget is tight?\n subreddit: buildapc",
  "title: 1440p build advice: AM5 + 7800 XT vs 4070 Super on a $1,200 budget?\n self_text: I'm building my first 1440p/144Hz rig mainly for single-player AAA and some light productivity (DaVinci Resolve, VS Code). Budget is ~$1,200 before tax in the US, no peripherals needed. Considering Ryzen 5 7600 or 7700 + B650 + 32GB DDR5-6000 CL30, 2TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe, 750W Gold PSU, and either RX 7800 XT (16GB) or RTX 4070 Super (12GB). Priorities: quiet, efficient, upgradable (AM5), good 1440p high/ultra with occasional RT. I value DLSS/Frame Gen but also like the 16GB VRAM on 7800 XT. Questions: which GPU makes more sense for modern 1440p given VRAM vs RT/DLSS tradeoffs; is 7600 enough or worth stretching to 7700; any B650 boards known for great memory support and VRM thermals under $200; recommended cases for silence with decent airflow (e.g., 4000D vs Pop Silent); is a 750W PSU sufficient headroom for either GPU; any must-have Micro Center combos I should watch for? Games: Cyberpunk 2077, Starfield, Elden Ring, Baldur's Gate 3, Helldivers 2. Open to used parts for GPU only. Thanks!\n subreddit: r/buildapc",

I know Resolve leans Nvidia for many effects, but VRAM helps on heavier timelines. Quick Sync on Intel is appealing for HEVC decode/encode; 7800X3D is killer for gaming but no iGPU QS.\n\nOther parts (tentative):\n- Cooler: Thermalright Phantom Spirit SE or NH‑D15 (open to AIO if needed for 14700K)\n- SSD: 2TB NVMe Gen4 (SN850X / 990 Pro / P44 Pro)\n- PSU: 850W ATX 3.0 (RM850e / Focus / A850GL)\n- Case: Fractal North / 4000D / Lancool 216\n- Budget: ~$1,700–$2,000 before tax (USA), Micro Center nearby\n\nQuestions:\n1) For my split, is the 14700K’s Quick Sync and extra cores worth the heat/power/noise over a 7800X3D, or does GPU‑accelerated Resolve (with 4070S) make the AMD route the better all‑rounder?\n2) If I go Nvidia, is 12GB VRAM on 4070S enough for 4K HEVC timelines with some NR and light Fusion, or should I stretch to a 4070 Ti Super (16GB)?\n3) If I go AMD GPU, will I regret it in Resolve compared to CUDA/NVENC, even with 20GB VRAM?\n4) Any motherboard picks with good VRMs/BIOS and sensible defaults for either platform?\n\nOpen to part swaps and deal tips.

  "title: I went USB‑C‑only for 90 days—these are the surprising holdouts. What are yours?\n self_text: I swapped everything to USB‑C cables and a 65W GaN charger to simplify travel and my desk. Phone, laptop, earbuds, e‑reader, and power bank were seamless. The friction showed up in the “little” gadgets: bike lights and a decade‑old action cam still on micro‑USB, a proprietary smartwatch puck, an electric toothbrush with a weird cradle, and a wireless keyboard that needs a USB‑A dongle just to update firmware. A few lessons: not all C cables are equal (3A vs 5A, 60W vs 100W, USB 2.0 vs 3.x data), so labeling them mattered more than I expected; multi‑port chargers juggle power in ways that can confuse fast‑charge handshakes; and tiny A‑to‑C adapters are great until you lose them. For anyone who’s tried this: 1) What compact 3–4 port GaN chargers have been rock‑solid for you? 2) Favorite affordable, reliable 100W (or 240W) cables you can actually trust? 3) Best way to deal with micro‑USB holdouts—adapters or just keep a short A‑to‑micro cable in the bag? Also curious what devices in 2025 you still can’t escape proprietary charging for.\n subreddit: gadgets",

Draft list: Case: Cooler Master NR200P (or Fractal Terra if the GPU fits); CPU: Ryzen 7 7800X3D (or 7700 if easier to cool); Cooler: Noctua NH-U12A or 240mm AIO if NR200P supports top/bottom; GPU: RTX 4070 Super 2.5-3-slot (shorter cards okay); Mobo: B650I; RAM: 32GB DDR5-6000 EXPO; PSU: SFX-L 850W (Corsair SF850L); Storage: 2TB Gen4 NVMe. Questions: 1) For a living room at couch distance, will 7800X3D with NH-U12A stay quiet under gaming loads, or is ECO mode/PPT limit recommended? 2) NR200P vs Terra for noise and dust; any gotchas with riser cables, airflow orientation, and mesh panel choice? 3) Best practice for GPU fan curves and undervolting (e.g., 4070 Super at 0.95V) to cut coil whine and temps without performance cliff. 4) Are there short, quiet 4070S models you recommend that fit both cases (max length 330 mm NR200P, 322 mm Terra)? 5) Would a 750W SFX be sufficient, or is 850W the quieter choice due to fan curve?
