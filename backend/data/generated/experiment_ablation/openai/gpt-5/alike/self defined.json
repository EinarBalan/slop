  "title: Airflow balance and fan curve sanity check for mid-tower build (positive pressure?)\n self_text: I’ve got a mesh-front mid-tower and want a sanity check on airflow and fan curves. Current setup: 2x140mm front intake ~900 RPM, 1x140mm bottom intake ~800 RPM, 1x140mm rear exhaust ~900 RPM, 2x120mm top exhaust ~700 RPM. CPU is on a dual-fan tower cooler blowing front-to-back; GPU is a triple-fan, 3-slot card. Goals: cool GPU under sustained load without ramping noise too much and keep dust down. Questions: 1) Is this likely to yield slight positive pressure, or should I bump front/bottom intakes +100–150 RPM relative to exhaust to be safe? 2) Any reason to flip top fans to intake in a mesh-top case, or is exhaust still the better default to avoid heat soak and dust? 3) Best practice for fan curves: link front/bottom intake to GPU temp and rear/top to CPU temp, or just use a blended source (highest of CPU/GPU)? 4) For dust, better to remove the top filter if running exhaust, or keep it on to reduce recirculation? 5) Quick test plan: run a 15–20 minute combined CPU+GPU load and log case/CPU/GPU temps and RPMs, then adjust to maintain a small RPM bias toward intake—does that sound right? Any other pitfalls I’m missing (fan orientation checks, motherboard PWM vs DC quirks, minimum duty to avoid stalling)? Thanks for any tips.\n subreddit: buildapc",

Goal: quiet 1440p system with solid temps under gaming loads. Planned parts: RTX 4070 Super (2.5-slot, ~300mm), Ryzen 7 7700 (65W), 32GB DDR5-6000, SFX/SFX-L 750–850W. Cooling ideas: NR200P with a dual-tower air cooler like Scythe Fuma 2 (fits) and bottom-intake/top-exhaust fan layout; A4-H2O with a 240mm AIO and careful fan curves. Questions: 1) For those who’ve run a 4070S in either case, how are GPU hotspot temps and noise at stock vs mild undervolt? 2) If you’ve used both, which case felt easier to keep quiet under load? 3) Any gotchas with PSU choice (SFX-L vs SFX) and cable management, especially in A4-H2O? 4) NR200P owners: better results with mesh side and bottom 120mm intakes + top exhausts, or do side intakes meaningfully help GPU temps? 5) A4-H2O owners: how’s AIO noise over time and radiator placement affecting GPU intake? Bonus: recommendations for quiet 120mm fans and a safe undervolt starting point for the 7700 and 4070S. Real-world temps, fan curves, and parts fit notes would be super appreciated before I buy the case. Thanks!\n subreddit: buildapc",

I’ve read top exhaust can increase perceived noise—worth it for thermals in a compact build?\n2) Positive pressure target: If front/bottom are filtered, should I bias intakes by +1 fan or just run a steeper PWM curve on intakes?\n3) Fan recommendations: Looking for quiet, good static pressure 140 mm front fans and a solid 120 mm rear. Are daisy-chainable fans (e.g., Lian Li P28) worth it to reduce cables in tight spaces?\n4) Cable management: Any tips for keeping it tidy in Pop Mini Air/Meshify 2 Mini (tie points, velcro vs zip ties, routing behind PSU shroud)? Are shorter modular cable kits worth it, or will stock Corsair lengths be okay?\n5) PSU pick: Anyone used RMx SHIFT in mATX—do the side connectors clash with front fans/side panel? If risky, should I stick to a standard RMx/RMe?\n6) Compatibility gotchas: Cooler height clearance with side panel and top fans; front fan/radiator clearance vs GPU length; front USB-C header clearance on common B650M boards?\n7) Dust control: Is a filtered bottom intake for GPU helpful here, or better to block it off and rely on strong front intake?\n\nIf you have a tried-and-true fan curve for quiet profiles in these cases, I’d love to see it.

Any real-world temp/noise experiences welcome.\n2) GPU fit: Any 4070 Super models you’d recommend that fit cleanly with side AIO and won’t choke for air? I’m trying to avoid 3-slot bricks.\n3) Motherboard pick: Between the Gigabyte and ASUS ITX B650 boards, which has better memory compatibility and BIOS QoL for EXPO 6000?\n4) Cables: For 12VHPWR in SFF, is a low-profile angled adapter still advisable, or should I stick with the native 12V-2x6 cable that comes with the PSU? I’m worried about bend radius against the side panel.\n5) Airflow: Preferred fan orientation for this case?

Preferences: healer/support roles, instanced group PvE over open-world grind, minimal FOMO/daily chores, fair monetization, NA servers; controller support is a plus. Deal-breakers: forced open-world PvP, heavy pay-to-win, mandatory multi-week attunements. Considering returning to FFXIV for Dawntrail, trying ESO, or diving back into GW2 with SotO/Janthir. How are queues, learning curves, and community vibes for endgame group content right now? Any underrated options I should look at (e.g., LOTRO raids, DCUO endgame, Blue Protocol) that fit short-session group play? Recommendations and “what the endgame loop actually looks like day-to-day” would be super helpful—thanks!\n subreddit: r/MMORPG",
  "title: Is a 750W PSU enough for a 5800X3D + RX 7800 XT build, or should I go 850W for headroom?\n self_text: Planning a mid-range gaming build and want sanity checks on power and thermals. Parts: Ryzen 7 5800X3D, RX 7800 XT (likely Nitro+), B550 board, 32GB DDR4-3600, 2x NVMe, Fractal Pop Air or Corsair 4000D, Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 or DeepCool AK620, and either a Seasonic Focus GX-750 or Corsair RM750x. This is for 1440p gaming with some light streaming. Questions: 1) Is a quality 750W unit sufficient given transient spikes on modern GPUs, or is 850W worth it for cooler/quieter operation and future upgrades? 2) Best fan layout for these cases for quiet-but-cool (thinking 2x140 front intake, 1x120 rear exhaust, maybe 2x120 top exhaust) — any airflow tips or preferred fan models? 3) Any gotchas with GPU length and cable clearance in these cases, and do I need an anti-sag bracket? 4) Suggested PBO/CO settings for the 5800X3D and undervolt targets for the 7800 XT to keep temps and noise in check? Appreciate real-world experiences and recommendations before I pull the trigger.\n subreddit: buildapc",
  "title: Help me pick parts for a quiet 1440p build: 7800X3D + 4070 Super or 7800 XT, and is my 750W PSU enough?\n self_text: Building a quiet 1440p rig primarily for RPGs/MMOs (BG3, FFXIV, Elden Ring) plus light video editing. I already own a mesh mid-tower, 3x140mm case fans, a 1TB NVMe, and a 750W Gold PSU. Budget for CPU+GPU+MB+RAM+cooler is ~$1,500. Leaning AMD for gaming: 7800X3D with a B650 board and 32GB DDR5-6000 CL30, cooled by a good air cooler (Fuma 2/Peerless Assassin) to keep noise down. GPU choice is between RTX 4070 Super and RX 7800 XT; I care about 1440p high settings, good frame pacing, and efficiency. Questions: 1) For longevity at 1440p, is 12GB VRAM on 4070 Super a concern vs 16GB on 7800 XT, or does DLSS offset it? 2) Will my quality 750W Gold PSU have enough headroom for 7800X3D + either GPU without coil whine or fan ramp issues, or should I step up to 850W? 3) Any B650 motherboard picks with good VRMs and quiet chipset cooling under $200? 4) For acoustics, would a 240mm AIO be noticeably quieter than a top-tier air cooler in a mesh case, or should I stick with air and undervolt/curve optimize? 5) Any gotchas on case airflow (front-to-back vs top exhaust) for these parts?
