  "title: Can a “Vigilant of Stendarr” do Oblivion Walker without becoming a monster? Looking for route/loopholes\n self_text: Trying a role‑play run as a Vigilant of Stendarr in SSE/AE (no mods), Survival on, no fast travel. I want to 100% achievements if possible, but I’m realizing Oblivion Walker seems to force some pretty hard moral breaks.\n\nGround rules I’m aiming for:\n- No murdering non‑hostile NPCs or sacrificing followers\n- No cannibalism, no torture\n- No vampirism/lycanthropy (leaning Savior’s Hide or Ring path only if it’s the “lesser evil”)\n- I’ll “engage” Daedra only to contain/destroy their influence; I can pick up artifacts but won’t use the obviously evil ones beyond quest completion\n\nFrom what I remember:\n- Fine/neutral: Azura’s Star (choose Azura’s), Dawnbreaker, Sanguine Rose, Wabbajack, Spellbreaker, Volendrung, Oghma Infinium, Ebony Blade (don’t power it), possibly Ring of Hircine if siding with Sinding counts as self‑defense vs aggressive hunters.\n- Problem quests: Molag Bal (Logrolf torture), Namira (Verulus), Vaermina (killing Erandur for Skull), Boethiah (sacrifice required), Mehrunes’ Razor (Silus).\n- Clavicus Vile: Masque is okay if I spare Barbas; Rueful Axe historically doesn’t count.\n- Hircine: Which choice is “least bad” and still counts for the artifact?\n- Hermaeus Mora: Harvesting blood can be done off existing corpses, right?\n\nQuestions:\n1) Is there any legit route to 15 artifacts without the five “heinous” quests above? AE didn’t add any alternates that count for Oblivion Walker, right?\n2) Any accepted “lawful” loopholes or mechanics I’m missing? e.g., does refusing to power Ebony Blade still count; can any of the bad kills be avoided via unique dialogue checks; does a known non‑murder option exist for Razor or Skull?\n3) If it’s impossible, what’s your preferred RP compromise? Headcanon that “mercy killing” applies anywhere? Sacrifice an irredeemably evil follower for Boethiah? Or just skip the cheevo to keep the build’s integrity?\n\nBonus: If you’ve done a Vigilant build, I’d love perk/gear tips. Thinking maces + heavy armor, Block, Restoration (Turn/Banish), a bit of Alteration for flesh spells, and Meridia’s/Dawnbreaker as the main “sanctioned” artifact.\n\nThanks for any route planning or philosophy takes—trying to thread the needle between RP and achievements without turning into exactly what Stendarr hates.\n subreddit: skyrim",
  "title: AE 100% help: Safe quest order for all Daedric artifacts + all Stones of Barenziah (avoid missables/bugs)?\n self_text: Planning a fresh AE run and trying to be smart about sequencing so I don’t lock myself out of Oblivion Walker or any unique items, and also finish No Stone Unturned without fighting bugs. Looking for a sanity check and gotchas.\n\nGoals\n- All achievements (AE on console, no mods).\n- Oblivion Walker without doing Namira for RP reasons.\n- All 24 Stones of Barenziah + Crown.\n- Minimize quest/civil war conflicts and NPC deaths, keep Paarthurnax alive.\n\nMy tentative plan (please roast/improve)\n- Early game setup\n  - Join Thieves Guild ASAP so Stones start tracking, but don’t rush the main TG line; do radiant jobs while traveling.\n  - Start main quest up through The Way of the Voice, then pause until I’m ready for Diplomatic Immunity.\n  - Grab any stones I can along the way; specifically plan to get the Thalmor Embassy stone during Diplomatic Immunity.\n\n- Daedric artifacts route (skipping Namira, still hitting 15):\n  1) The Black Star or Azura’s Star (either counts; leaning Black Star).\n  2) The House of Horrors (Mace of Molag Bal).\n  3) A Daedra’s Best Friend (Masque of Clavicus Vile — return the axe, refuse to kill Barbas).\n  4) The Mind of Madness (Wabbajack).\n  5) A Night to Remember (Sanguine Rose).\n  6) The Cursed Tribe (Volendrung).\n  7) Ill Met by Moonlight — grab both artifacts: help Sinding kill hunters, exit and talk to Hircine to purify the ring, then go back in, kill Sinding, take his hide (Ring of Hircine + Savior’s Hide).\n  8) The Break of Dawn (Dawnbreaker).\n  9) Pieces of the Past — side with Mehrunes, kill Silus (Mehrunes’ Razor).\n  10) Boethiah’s Calling (Ebony Mail; I’ll use a disposable merc for the pillar sacrifice).\n  11) Waking Nightmare (Skull of Corruption).\n  12) The Only Cure (Spellbreaker).\n  13) The Whispering Door (Ebony Blade; I know about the “feed” requirement and will use non-essential friends).\n  14) Discerning the Transmundane (Oghma Infinium; I’m timing this with Elder Knowledge to avoid backtracking).\n\n- Main/faction beats\n  - Do Diplomatic Immunity with a checklist to grab the Embassy stone. Any clean way back if I somehow miss it, or is it still basically gone without glitches?\n  - Leave Civil War unresolved until after Season Unending to avoid extra collateral and weird jarl swaps mid-quests (especially Blood on the Ice).\n  - Blood on the Ice: best time to trigger it these days? Still safest before finishing the war, or does AE patch behavior make it reliable either way?\n  - Thieves Guild: do the 4 city influence jobs early so the special quests don’t conflict with civil war shifts; finish No Stone Unturned once I have all stones.\n  - Paarthurnax: plan to refuse the Blades’ demand; achievements unaffected, right?\n\nQuestions\n- Any quest-order landmines I’m missing that can block an artifact, a stone, or a unique reward?\n- Is the Embassy stone still the only truly missable Barenziah stone in AE if you forget it during Diplomatic Immunity?\n- Does doing Civil War before/after any of the above change availability of Stones, TG city jobs, or Blood on the Ice in 2025 AE?\n- Best low-guilt options for Boethiah’s sacrifice and Ebony Blade “friend” charges that won’t break future questlines?\n- Any AE/Creation Club additions that subtly interfere with this route?\n\nIf you have a tried-and-true order or a checklist you use, I’d love to see it.

  "title: Help me refine a “Thalmor Turncoat” build: quest order, gear gating, and role‑play dilemmas\n self_text: Concept: Altmer Justiciar who defects after seeing the Thalmor’s rot from the inside. Starts as a true believer and transitions into an undercover saboteur dismantling Thalmor influence across Skyrim.\n\nCore build\n- Skills: Illusion (control/cover), Alteration (mage-armor/utility), One‑Handed (dagger/sword), Sneak, Light Armor, Enchanting (later).\n- Playstyle: Infiltrator-mage. Opens with Calm/Fury/Muffle, picks off with dagger or Bound Sword, minimal overt magic until the “turn.”\n- Shouts: Restricted early. After defection, unlocks Unrelenting Force/Become Ethereal/Marked for Death as “weaponized heresy.”\n\nRole‑play rules\n- Start in Thalmor robes/Elven Light. Only use Thalmor/Elven gear pre‑turn. Avoid Daedric quests except Meridia; maybe Azura if RP fits.\n- No Talos shrines or pro‑Talos quests before turning; hand‑wave “official business” if you must interact.\n- No dragonsouls spent until after “turn.” No Civil War enrollment until after “turn.”\n- Pacifism bias: prefer Calm/Pacify/Command over outright killing unless it’s Thalmor or their direct proxies.\n\nPhases and quest beats\n1) Loyalist (levels ~1–12)\n- Get Thalmor gear from Justiciar encounters/Embassy or start with robes if using CC/AE starts.\n- College of Winterhold for magical training but no Arch‑Mage mantle yet (too public).\n- Thieves Guild entry purely for infiltration tools; do Delvin/Vex jobs to learn the hold power structure.\n\n2) The Turn (Diplomatic Immunity breakpoint)\n- Do Main Quest up to Diplomatic Immunity. Canonical disillusionment happens here.\n- After party/escape, you commit to sabotage: free prisoners, dump dossiers, permanently abandon Thalmor armor for a low‑profile set.\n\n3) Undercover Saboteur (midgame)\n- Systematically undermine Thalmor touchpoints:\n  - Missing in Action (rescue Thorald).\n  - Free/aid any Talos worshipers; protect shrines.\n  - Clear Northwatch Keep and any Thalmor patrols you find.\n- Join the Blades post‑Alduin’s Wall as a practical anti‑Alduin alliance. Parthurnax dilemma: either spare him and break with Delphine (morally consistent) or execute as a “the ends justify the means” relapse.\n\n4) Endgame alignment\n- Civil War: Lean Empire to reform from within and weaken Thalmor leverage, or Stormcloaks if you headcanon that open defiance better hastens Thalmor overreach. Looking for thoughts here.\n- Final kit shift to Penitus Oculatus or Blades gear to signal full break.\n\nGear progression\n- Early: Thalmor Robes or Elven Light + dagger/Bound Sword. Jewelry with Fortify Illusion/Alteration.\n- Mid: Fine clothes for infiltration; switch to Scaled/Elven Gilded with Fortify Illusion/1H/Sneak.\n- Late: Penitus Oculatus or Blades Armor (no helmets in cities to stay low‑profile). Enchant for Illusion cost reduction, 1H, and Sneak. Dagger with Absorb Magicka or Silent Moons flavor.\n\nMods (optional, open to alternatives)\n- Ordinator or Adamant + Mysticism to deepen Illusion/Alteration builds.\n- Immersive Patrols (to make Thalmor presence meaningful).\n- AI Overhaul + Relationship Dialogue Overhaul for social stealth vibes.\n- Timing is Everything to control when MQ/CW beats trigger.\n- Simple NPC Protection to avoid random Talos worshiper deaths ruining RP.\n- Equipment: WACCF/CCOR for sensible progression; a lightweight Thalmor overhaul if you have favorites.\n\nQuestions for the hive mind\n- Best quest order that feels like escalating sabotage without blowing cover too early? Any sleeper quests that scream “stick it to the Thalmor” I’m missing?\n- Clean gear‑gating ideas without console: when would you swap to Penitus or Blades armor so it feels earned?\n- Parthurnax choice for this character and why?\n- If going Empire, any RP‑friendly way to reconcile with General Tullius while quietly purging Thalmor influence?\n- Illusion perk picks you love for a dagger‑centric infiltrator? I’m torn between Frenzy routing vs Calm/Pacify.\n\nThanks in advance—trying to make this run feel like a political thriller instead of another shout‑spam Dragonborn!\n subreddit: SkyrimBuilds",
  "title: Pacifist Thieves Guild run: can I finish One With the Shadows with 0 kills (no mods)? Route/gear/quest-order advice?\n self_text: I want to do a true “ghost” Thieves Guild playthrough on AE with achievements on: keep People Killed at 0 (ideally Creatures/Animals Killed too), finish One With the Shadows, grab all Larceny Targets and the Stones of Barenziah, and avoid backstabs/poisons/followers/frenzy/trap kills. No mods. My questions: 1) Are there any forced-kill choke points in TG/misc TG-adjacent quests (Goldenglow Estate, Scoundrel’s Folly/Brinewater Grotto, Snow Veil Sanctum with Mercer, Irkngthand finale) that would break a 0-kill run, or can Calm/Invisibility/Quiet Casting get me through? Do Mercer/Karliah kills affect my stats? 2) Best early route/gear to make this feasible without touching the main quest (no dragons/shouts): fast ways to get Muffle/Invisibility (spell/enchants/potions), Quiet Casting, high Sneak and Illusion, and a good light set before Nightingale? 3) Any gotchas with player-triggered traps counting as kills or with paralysis/pickpocketing causing problems for the stats screen? 4) Recommended quest order to minimize combat exposure while still collecting Stones/Larceny Targets and progressing to the Nightingale set/Skeleton Key? I’d love specific room-by-room tips for Goldenglow and Brinewater Grotto, plus any potion loadout suggestions. Thanks!\n subreddit: skyrim",
  "title: Planning a zero‑kill Legendary run (stats stay at 0) — what kills are truly unavoidable in vanilla?\n self_text: I want to do a pure manipulation/pacifist run in vanilla SSE/AE where the Combat > Kills for People/Animals/Creatures all stay at 0. Looking for a definitive list of truly unavoidable kills and any known workarounds that keep the stat clean.\n\nRules\n- No followers, summons, or hired thugs (to avoid gray areas).\n- No direct damage (no weapon hits, damaging spells, or lethal poisons).\n- Allowed: Illusion (Calm/Frenzy/Mayhem/Pacify), Sneak, Speech, Alteration (Paralysis/Armor), Invisibility, nonlethal shouts (Throw Voice, Become Ethereal, Disarm, Kyne’s Peace), pickpocketing weapons/arrows, kiting enemies into other enemies/guards.\n- Environment/traps only if kills don’t credit the player; open to advice on which ones are “safe.”\n\nGoals\n- Fully restore the Thieves Guild (incl. Guild Master).\n- College of Winterhold mainline through Ancano.\n- Main Quest as far as possible without adding kills (Alduin?).\n- Optional: Civil War skipped; most Daedric quests skipped unless there’s a known pacifist route.\n\nKnown trouble spots (need confirmations/workarounds)\n- Western Watchtower: Can Mirmulnir die to guards with player landing 0 hits and still progress while keeping kill count at 0?\n- Alduin in Sovngarde: Can the Three Heroes get the last hit reliably so the kill doesn’t register to the player?\n- Mercer Frey: Can Karliah/Brynjolf handle the final blow without me tagging him?\n- Ancano: If I only use the Staff of Magnus to drop his shield and never damage him, can Tolfdir finish him and keep my kills at 0?\n- College early dungeons (Saarthal/Mzulft): Draugr/Falmer kills by Tolfdir/companions — do any forcibly credit to the player?\n- Dark Brotherhood intro (“With Friends Like These…”): Is there any way to avoid killing anyone (Astrid or captives) and still continue the game without DB involvement?\n- Daedric quests with “sacrifice” steps (Boethiah/Namira/Mehrunes): Are there any legit pacifist routes here, or hard no?\n- “Blood on the Ice”: Can guards handle the killer while I do zero damage and still complete the quest?\n\nTactics I’m planning (tell me if these are safe for the kill stat)\n- Frenzy/Mayhem and letting enemies/guards/mobs resolve combat.\n- Calm > pickpocket weapons/arrows, then slip by.\n- Luring into already-active dungeon traps without activating them myself.\n- Shouting Disarm > flee; or Become Ethereal to bypass setpieces.\n\nIf you’ve done a true 0-kill run, I’d love:\n- A list of quests you completed and any points where a kill seemed unavoidable.\n- Specific NPC/boss encounters where you confirmed the last hit can be done by allies/NPCs.\n- Any traps/shouts/poisons that secretly flag kills to the player.\n\nThanks!

  "title: AE 100% achievements in 2025: safest quest order and “Oblivion Walker” plan? (PS5, no mods)\n self_text: Starting a fresh Anniversary Edition run on PS5 and trying to 100% achievements in one save without console tricks or mods. Looking for a community-vetted route that avoids known lockouts and buggy corners. Questions:\n\n- Oblivion Walker specifics:\n  • Clavicus Vile: Masque vs Rueful Axe — still Masque-only for credit, right?\n  • Vaermina: if I spare Erandur, I lose the Skull — so for 15/15 I should, unfortunately, kill him?\n  • Hircine/“Ill Met by Moonlight”: Is the “get both rewards” method still reliable on current AE console patch, or should I plan on just one artifact from that quest to be safe?\n\n- “The Whispering Door”: Do I need to start it before any Civil War city flips (e.g., Whiterun changes jarl) to avoid it becoming unavailable?\n\n- Thieves Guild: For “One with the Shadows,” any 2025 tips to minimize radiant job grind and avoid bugged city triggers? Preferred job types to request/avoid, and fastest reset method without save-scumming?\n\n- Werewolf/Vampire perks: Best order to clear both “mastered” achievements in one file with minimal grind? (Companions first for Beast Form perks, then cure and go Vampire Lord for Dawnguard? Any pitfalls if I side Dawnguard vs Volkihar regarding future transformations?)\n\n- Master Criminal: What’s the current easiest/least-annoying method for 1,000 gold bounty in all holds without soft-locking vendors/quests for hours afterward?\n\n- Broad quest order sanity check:\n  • Early: Golden Claw > Dragon Rising; Unfathomable Depths; Book of Love (Agent of Mara); Discerning the Transmundane setup alongside main “Elder Knowledge.”\n  • Faction sequencing to avoid conflicts: Companions → College → Thieves → Dark Brotherhood → Civil War → finish Main; Dawnguard/Dragonborn slotted where?\n  • Any AE CC content I should delay (e.g., Saints & Seducers notes) to keep spawns manageable and prevent NPC deaths?\n\nIf anyone has a tried-and-true checklist or a 100% achievement route map (including DLC), I’d love a link.

  "title: Roleplaying a true-believer Thalmor Altmer — which quests fit, which break character?\n self_text: I’m planning a new Skyrim run as a loyalist Thalmor Justiciar posted to Skyrim. I want to keep choices lore-consistent and “in character,” not just min-max outcomes. Would love sanity checks and suggestions, especially for quests that don’t have clean Thalmor-aligned options.\n\nBuild/rules:\n- Altmer mage, Thalmor robes/Elven kit, mostly Illusion/Alteration/Destruction/Conjuration (Atronachs as “disposable assets”).\n- Atronach Stone, Survival on, minimal Shouts (using them as a state tool rather than Dragonborn “destiny”).\n- No Daedric worship. If a quest forces contact, I’ll minimize enabling the Prince and stash/destroy artifacts when possible.\n- RP: I’m here to enforce the Talos ban, keep Skyrim destabilized enough to weaken it, and advance the Dominion’s interests. Pragmatic, lawful-evil bureaucrat vibes.\n\nQuestline thoughts (tell me where this breaks lore or has better options):\n- Main Quest: Proceed as a state necessity (dragons are bad for everyone). Kill Paarthurnax to keep the Blades aligned with the Empire and to demonstrate zero tolerance for “reformed” enemies. Keep Delphine/Esbern as useful assets, but never fully trust them.\n- Civil War: Join Imperials as a Thalmor “liaison.” Enforce the Concordat, “help” the Empire while quietly prolonging the conflict (avoid blitzing the campaign; take detours, let forts respawn, etc.). Any RP-friendly ways to subtly sandbag without outright failing?\n- Thalmor Embassy: Headcanon as an internal audit/double-agent operation. I’m extracting intel while letting Elenwen save face. Any roleplay-friendly mod or dialogue tweaks folks use here?\n- Companions: Either ignore (Nordic werewolf cult, ew) or infiltrate then cure the Circle to remove a destabilizing wildcard. Which path aligns more with Dominion interests?\n- College of Winterhold: Feels like a natural fit for an Altmer mage. Be polite but haughty, report dangerous artifacts to the Thalmor (in headcanon). No way to side with Ancano, so treat his failure as “regrettable incompetence,” then leverage the Eye for political capital.\n- Dark Brotherhood: Destroy them. A sovereign needs stability; assassins are bad for regime control (unless you own them).\n- Thieves Guild: Potentially useful if kept on a leash. Do the minimum for influence, avoid glorifying the guild. Any choices that keep them weak but cooperative?\n- Daedric quests: Skip or subvert. Examples:\n  - Boethiah: Burn the cult down if possible (ugh, I know).\n  - Meridia: Destroy/contain undead threat but don’t become her champion in spirit.\n  - Molag Bal/Mephala/Namira: Hard no.\n- “Missing in Action”: Best way to keep Thorald in Thalmor hands? My recollection is you can convince the family to stand down without a clean “side with Thalmor” outcome—confirm?\n- Markarth/Forsworn: The Dominion benefits from a simmering crisis. Enable just enough Forsworn chaos to weaken the Reach’s cohesion, but prevent outright collapse. Which choices in the city quests best model “managed instability”?\n- Dawnguard: Side with Dawnguard to curb Vampire chaos (public order). Could also infiltrate Volkihar, but the optics are terrible for a Justiciar.\n- Dragonborn (Solstheim): Treat Miraak as a rival power center to be removed; cooperate with the East Empire Company for trade leverage. Any gotchas that would read as anti-Dominion?\n\nGear/roleplay flavor:\n- Thalmor robe set in cities, Elven light for fieldwork. Carry an Elven dagger for “legal” executions. Confiscate Talos amulets as “evidence.”\n- Only use Shouts in front of authorities when it advances state interests; otherwise keep the Dragonborn angle quiet to avoid mythic nationalism.\n\nLooking for:\n- Quests I should avoid/approach differently to stay plausibly Thalmor.\n- Any in-game choices that subtly strengthen the Dominion or weaken Nordic unity.\n- Mod recs that help (e.g., civil war overhauls, Thalmor roleplay/dialogue expansions, Lawbringer-style enforcement tools) without turning this into a completely different game.\n\nThanks! I’m aiming for “awful but consistent bureaucrat,” not cartoon villain. If you’ve done a Thalmor run, what decisions surprised you or felt the most “in character”?\n subreddit: skyrim",
  "title: Planning a “Museum Curator” run: 100% uniques/Daedric artifacts/Stones with Survival + no fast travel — missables and quest order?\nself_text: I want to do a nerdy collector playthrough that checks these boxes:\n- Survival mode on, no fast travel (carriages/boats okay).\n- Vanilla + DLC (no mods/console).\n- 100% unique named items I reasonably can get in one run: Daedric artifacts, all Dragon Priest masks (incl. Wooden Mask + Konahrik), all puzzle claws, all Stones of Barenziah, plus standout uniques (Chillrend highest tier, Nightingale set, Longhammer, Ghostblade, Targe of the Blooded, Shield of Solitude, etc.).\n- Also aiming for achievements like Oblivion Walker without glitching.\n\nLooking for two things: 1) a heads‑up list of missables/mutually exclusive choices and 2) a smart route/quest order that plays nice with Survival + no-FT.\n\nMissables/exclusives I’m planning around — please correct/add:\n- Thalmor Embassy Stone of Barenziah: grab during Diplomatic Immunity or it’s effectively gone?\n- Dark Brotherhood: if I destroy them, I lose Ancient Shrouded set/Blade of Woe/Emperor’s Robes. If I join, anything else become unobtainable?\n- Dawnguard choice: What’s truly one-side-only? (e.g., Ring of the Erudite/Beast + Harkon’s Sword vs Dawnguard rune/crossbow variants). For a “collection,” is Volkihar the better pick?\n- Forsworn Conspiracy/Cidhna Mine: Old Gods armor set vs Silver-Blood Family Ring — can only get one per run?\n- Aetherium (“Lost to the Ages”): Crown vs Shield vs Staff — still only one, right?\n- Leveled items worth waiting for 46+ (or specific thresholds): Chillrend, Nightingale gear, Dragonbane, Pale Blade, Shield of Solitude — any others?\n- Thieves Guild: best timing for Stones, Gate key points for the Embassy Stone, and when to finally return the Skeleton Key (need “One with the Shadows” but want the key for a while).\n- Daedric quest choices to protect Oblivion Walker: take Masque (return Rueful Axe), kill Silus for Razor, side with Eola for Namira, take Skull of Corruption (kill Erandur), pick Black Star or Azura’s (either counts), Ill Met By Moonlight pick one (no glitch).\n\nRoute/Survival flow ideas I’d love:\n- Early warmth/carry picks: Steed vs Lord/Atronach, easy fur sets, food loops.\n- Efficient regional circuits that chain uniques/Stones/masks without backtracking. Example rough thoughts:\n  - Whiterun hub loop → Volunruud/Volskygge/Dead Men’s Respite → Solitude/Wolfskull → Markarth (House of Horrors/Forsworn chain) → Reach ruins (Targe).\n  - Winterhold/College base → Saarthal/Septimus/Alftand (Targe of the Blooded) → Shearpoint (Krosis) loops.\n- Thalmor Embassy timing so I don’t miss the Stone while keeping Survival logistics sane.\n- Solstheim timing (Black Books, Deathbrand at 36+, Blackguard set) with cold management and minimal sea crossings.\n\nHousing/storage:\n- Best early safe storage without displays (and where to stash Stones before finishing the TG). Proudspire has a Stone—should I plan the gold early? Any containers people get burned by?\n\nIf you’ve got a tried-and-true checklist or quest order that minimizes lockouts (or a “grab-these-NOW” missable list), I’m all ears.

Take Mage Stone, carriage to Winterhold, join College.\n2) Early dungeons heavy on bandits/draugr for ethical reanimates: Embershard → Bleak Falls, etc. Spam Soul Trap on corpses to level Conjuration.\n3) Windhelm: do “Blood on the Ice” carefully to end with the Necromancer Amulet in my inventory.\n4) College to completion for Morokei/Staff of Magnus; train Conjuration with Phinis to push to 90 and unlock the Master Ritual for Dead Thrall.\n5) “Lost to the Ages” for Aetherial Crown (pair Lord + Mage or Lord + Apprentice depending on magicka needs).\n6) Solstheim later: Black Book “Filament and Filigree” for Secret of Arcana (great for free-cast windows of Dead Thrall/expensive spells).\n7) Dawnguard on Dawnguard side (fits compassion better than full Volkihar). I’ll avoid sun spells when I’m actively running thralls.\n\nRP rules I’m trying to stick to\n- Reanimate only those who attacked first (bandits, warlocks, cultists, draugr)\n- Don’t use reanimation on named NPCs or civilians\n- Release thralls after a dungeon/encounter; no permanent “pet bandit chief” if I can help it\n- Prefer Calm/Pacify and Turn Undead to avoid killing when feasible\n- Spare Cicero, spare Paarthurnax, skip Dark Brotherhood\n\nQuestions for the hive mind\n- Best “ethical” long-term thralls that are durable but not immersion-breaking? (Bandit Marauders? Hagravens feel wrong; Draugr Deathlords okay?)\n- Any clean way to manage Survival warmth while still looking like a necromancer mage without smithing? Favorite buyable pieces or sets?\n- Does Alteration’s Stability materially extend dual-cast reanimate durations in your experience, or should I just lean harder into Conjuration perks?\n- Early-game staff recommendations that fit the theme and help before Dead Thrall (e.g., Staff of Paralysis/Calm picks and where to find/buy)?\n- Would you slot Illusion deeper (Pacify/Call to Arms) or keep it light and invest more in Alteration defenses?\n- Any quest order tweaks that get me to strong reanimates sooner without breaking Survival pacing/no fast travel?\n\nThanks!

  "title: Help me min-max morality: least-evil path to Oblivion Walker for a Divines archivist run (AE, no exploits)\n self_text: Doing an AE run where my character is basically a “Temple Archivist” for the Divines: collect Daedric artifacts to lock them away, document the heresies, etc. I want the Oblivion Walker achievement on this save, but I’m trying to keep the body count and outright depravity to a minimum (no save-scumming, no console, no “get both” glitches unless they still naturally work in 2025 AE). Platform: PS5.\n\nQuestions I’d love clarity on:\n- What exactly counts in AE right now? My understanding: Masque of Clavicus Vile counts, Rueful Axe does not; Azura’s Star or The Black Star either one counts; Skeleton Key does not. Correct?\n- Can you still get both Ring of Hircine and Savior’s Hide on current AE/PS5 without exploits/save wizard nonsense? If yes, do both count toward the 15?\n- What’s the minimum “truly evil” stuff I must do to hit 15? My rough read is that these are the worst offenders:\n  • Ring of Namira (requires cannibalism of Verulus)\n  • Ebony Mail (requires sacrificing a follower)\n  • Mace of Molag Bal (torture/murder of Logrolf)\n  • Skull of Corruption (murder Erandur)\n  • Mehrunes’ Razor (murder Silus)\n  If I skip any of these, is there a legit replacement to still reach 15 without dipping into exploits?\n- For Ill Met by Moonlight, is the “least awful” route to take the Ring of Hircine by helping Sinding and only killing hunters (self-defense), and skip Savior’s Hide? Or is there a cleanish path to Hide?\n- Any gotchas/order tips so I don’t lock myself out (e.g., Whispering Door rumor timing, Civil War interfering with anything, Creation Club artifacts that don’t count, etc.)?\n\nTentative “clean” list I’m planning:\n- Azura’s Star (Azura path)\n- Dawnbreaker\n- Sanguine Rose\n- Wabbajack\n- Oghma Infinium\n- Volendrung\n- Spellbreaker\n- Masque of Clavicus Vile (spare Barbas)\n- Ring of Hircine (help Sinding)\n- Ebony Blade (unpowered)\n\nThat’s 10. Which 5 “dirty” ones would you pick as the least morally egregious (or most justifiable RP-wise) to round out to 15? And if there’s a legit, current AE method to reduce that number (e.g., Hircine double still working on PS5 and both counting), please let me know the exact steps.\n\nAppreciate any up-to-date guidance and order-of-operations from folks who’ve done a similar “Divines-first, achievement-hunting librarian” run!\n subreddit: skyrim",

Found loot only.\n- No stealing, no murder, pay bounties, sleep/eat RP rules, no fast travel.\n- “State-sanctioned” violence only: bandit leaders, named contract targets, or clear self-defense.\n- No intentional exploits unless the community generally treats them as “fair game.”\n\nArtifacts I’m fine with\n- Azura’s Star (pick Azura’s side), Dawnbreaker, Sanguine Rose, Spellbreaker, Wabbajack, Volendrung, Masque of Clavicus Vile (spare Barbas), Oghma Infinium (harvest from already-dead), Ebony Blade (take it but never feed it), Ring or Savior’s Hide (either path sparing innocents), Nocturnal/Nightingale path (return the Skeleton Key; I know it doesn’t count).\n\nThe problem children (how do you all justify these?)\n- Molag Bal (House of Horrors): You torture and kill Logrolf. Is there any non-evil route to still get the Mace? Or is this a hard skip for a moral character?\n- Namira (Taste of Death): Requires cannibalism. Any legit way to get the Ring without eating Brother Verulus? If not, this feels like a hard skip too.\n- Boethiah (Boethiah’s Calling): Needs a follower sacrifice. Is there a “least-awful” candidate people use for RP (e.g., truly irredeemable killer), or is the act itself indefensible? Any non-lethal workaround on console?\n- Mehrunes Dagon (Pieces of the Past): You must kill Silus for the Razor. Any angle where a lawful character can justify executing him? Or is letting him live and forfeiting the artifact the only “good” option?\n- Vaermina (Waking Nightmare): To get the Skull you have to betray and kill Erandur as he’s cleansing the staff. Does anyone headcanon taking the Skull to safeguard it as “the lesser evil,” or is that just mental gymnastics?\n\nWhere I’m at\n- If I avoid exploits and keep my RP strict, I can only skip one quest and still hit 15, since you can’t get both Hircine artifacts in a legit run. That means I’d still have to do at least three of the above five, which feels… not very “good.”\n- If I allow the old Ring + Savior’s Hide “double-dip” on Hircine (is that still doable on AE/PS5?), I could skip two of the truly vile ones (probably Molag Bal and Namira) and stomach Boethiah/Mehrunes/Vaermina with some headcanon. Is that considered acceptable or just cheating?\n\nSpecific questions\n- Current patch reality check: Ebony Blade does still count toward Oblivion Walker, right? Skeleton Key and Rueful Axe do not, correct?\n- Are there any obscure dialogue checks/timing tricks to mitigate the worst acts (e.g., any way to spare Silus and still get Razor… I’m pretty sure no)?\n- For Boethiah, is there any follower the community broadly agrees is a “just” sacrifice for a lawful playthrough? Or is the consensus to skip it if you’re strict?\n- If you’ve done a “good guy” Oblivion Walker, which two did you skip, and how did you justify the rest?\n\nI’m not trying to min-max morality points, just keep the character intact while chasing the achievement. Curious where you all draw the line and what house rules you use.\n subreddit: skyrim",
  "title: Is an “ethical” Oblivion Walker run actually possible? Help me map the least‑awful choices for each Daedric quest\n self_text: I want to do an Oblivion Walker run on AE without crossing a few personal lines:\n- No killing non-hostile NPCs (hostiles/bandits/Daedra are fine)\n- No cannibalism\n- No torture\n- Prefer not to join the Dark Brotherhood\n\nFrom memory this seems impossible if I need 15 artifacts, but I’m hoping the hive mind can sanity-check and maybe point out edge cases or version quirks I’m missing. Here’s my current map, focusing on “least awful” outcomes that still award the artifact:\n\nSeems fine (hostiles only / no moral calamity):\n- Azura: Azura’s Star (or The Black Star) — both count, right? Which is “cleaner” to you?\n- Meridia: Dawnbreaker — you kill necromancers/corrupted shades only.\n- Peryite: Spellbreaker — all hostiles.\n- Sheogorath: Wabbajack — chaotic but no innocent murder required.\n- Sanguine: Sanguine Rose — mostly prank-tier chaos.\n- Clavicus Vile: Masque of Clavicus Vile — spare Barbas, Masque still counts.\n- Hircine: Ring of Hircine — side with Sinding and only kill the hunters that attack (hostile). This passes my rules; agree?\n- Malacath: Volendrung — Orc drama, but combatants are hostile.\n- Hermaeus Mora: Oghma Infinium — Septimus’ fate is… complicated, but the Dragonborn doesn’t directly murder him.\n\nQuestionable/unknown:\n- Mephala: Ebony Blade — does it count for the achievement without “feeding” it on friends? If it counts uncharged, it fits my rules; if it must be charged via friendly NPC kills, hard fail.\n- Nocturnal: Skeleton Key — doesn’t count for the achievement iirc, and you return it anyway.\n\nHard fails under my rules (tell me if there’s a legit workaround I’m missing):\n- Namira: Ring of Namira — cannibalism required.\n- Boethiah: Ebony Mail — requires sacrificing a follower (non-hostile murder).\n- Molag Bal: Mace of Molag Bal — torture/murder of a non-hostile priest.\n- Vaermina: Skull of Corruption — requires killing Erandur (non-hostile).\n- Mehrunes Dagon: Mehrunes’ Razor — killing Silus (non-hostile) to complete.\n\nBy my count, even giving Mephala the benefit of the doubt, I’m topping out around 10–11 artifacts, which bricks the achievement. Is there any vanilla path on current AE/console patches that:\n- Lets Ebony Blade count without feeding?\n- Gives Razor without killing Silus (I assume no)?\n- Reframes Hircine or any other quest in a way that avoids non-hostile kills I overlooked?\n\nIf an absolutely pure run can’t hit 15, I’d love opinions on the “least-awful” two or three non-hostile kills you’d allow to squeak over the line. Which of Silus/Erandur/Boethiah’s victim/Molag Bal’s priest is the smallest ethical breach in your headcanon?\n\nVersion/context: AE, current patch, no mods. Thanks for helping me draw the cleanest possible map here!\n subreddit: skyrim",
  "title: Trying a “Wandering Steward of Kyne” run: no main quest, no guilds, no fast travel—how do you keep it engaging long‑term without smithing grind?\n self_text: I want a chill, nature‑first Skyrim playthrough that still has a sense of progression without turning into iron‑dagger spam or endless bandit dungeons. Theme is a wandering hunter devoted to Kyne: living off the land, protecting wildlife/balance, helping locals, avoiding big politics.\n\nConstraints\n- No main quest (so no dragons/shouts), no guilds, no Daedric quests, no Civil War.\n- No fast travel; carriages/boats OK.\n- Minimal crafting: tanning/tempering allowed with found materials only; no grindy smithing/enchanting loops.\n- Combat focus: Archery + Light Armor + Alchemy + Sneak + Speech. No followers. Optional dagger for emergencies.\n- Dungeon delving only when it makes sense (bounties, word walls you stumble on, wilderness lairs). Prefer outdoors content.\n\nWhat I’m looking for\n- Progression that feels meaningful without the usual power spikes:\n  - Good “hunter” perk path to keep fights interesting at mid/high levels (Archery perks you prioritize? Hunter’s Discipline feels thematic).\n  - Alchemy combos that fit the vibe without being broken. Current plan: Fortify Marksman via Canis Root + Juniper Berries or Elves Ear; a light stamina/health stew rotation for sustain.\n  - Money loops that don’t require enchanting/smithing spam. Do you tan certain pelts for better value (e.g., deer/fox into leather) and leave others as-is? Best hunting circuits you like (Whiterun tundra Rorikstead–Greymoor, The Rift treelines, Eastmarch hot springs)?\n- Content that fits the theme:\n  - Kyne’s Sacred Trials (Froki’s quest) is a must—any other nature‑forward quests or radiant jobs you recommend?\n  - AE/Fishing/Survival/Camping content that adds satisfying goals on console (I’m on PlayStation): favorite fishing routes or unique catches, campsite locations, food buffs you actually use?\n  - Roleplay milestones besides gear: become Thane in holds that don’t touch MQ, homestead suggestions (Lakeview?) that feel “ranger cabin” rather than lordly manor, map‑wide “clear all standing stones” type goals.\n- Gear progression without guilds/Daedric:\n  - Any unique bows/sets that are accessible with my constraints? Thinking Bow of the Hunt (Clearspring Tarn) early. Other finds you like for a Kyne devotee?\n  - Arrow economy tips without crafting: merchants worth a regular circuit (The Drunken Huntsman, Fletcher), training with guards/archers to recover arrows, etc.\n\nPain points I anticipate\n- Radiant bounties turning into samey bandit caves—how do you keep variety? Rotate holds? Self-limit on clearing?\n- Midgame scaling where basic wildlife stops being threatening—any self-rules to keep the “steward of the wilds” feel (e.g., prioritize traps, environmental kills, avoid over-tempering)?\n\nWould love build outlines, route suggestions, and “little goals” that make this kind of run sing.

  "title: Help sanity-check my Skyrim “Temple Archivist” run (no crafting, Daedric artifact catalog, RP-first)  \nself_text: I want to do a Dunmer “Temple Archivist” roleplay: a former Tribunal acolyte fleeing Morrowind who joins the College and quietly “catalogs and safeguards” powerful relics… which, in practice, means doing every Daedric quest for Oblivion Walker while trying not to feel like a complete monster.\n\nConstraints and vibe:\n- No crafting: no Smithing, no Enchanting, no Alchemy. Scrolls and staves are allowed as “relics,” potions from vendors/loot only.\n- Skills focus: Restoration, Alteration, Illusion, Speech, Lockpicking, a touch of One-Hand (dagger) for emergencies. Mostly control/support, let followers/staves do damage.\n- Gear: robes, circlets/hoods, rings/amulets only. Unique/quest items favored. No tempering.\n- Factions: College of Winterhold main. Maybe Dawnguard (scholarly interest in Elder Scrolls) but otherwise avoid “mercenary” vibes.\n\nGoals/questions:\n1) Oblivion Walker but RP-friendly: Which Daedric quests can I justify as “secure the artifact for containment” without doing egregiously evil acts? I know some are rough:\n   - Vaermina (Skull of Corruption): requires betraying Erandur. Any RP-friendly alternative to still hit 15 artifacts without this one?\n   - Namira (Taste of Death): hard no thematically, but that’s one artifact less.\n   - Boethiah: murdering a follower is… yikes. Any creative workaround people have used for a not-utterly-evil take?\n   - Clavicus Vile: keep Barbas alive gives Masque (counts). Rueful Axe doesn’t count—so Masque it is, right?\n   - Hircine: can do Savior’s Hide or Ring of Hircine (or both with the old trick)—is getting both still possible in current AE/SE patches without mods?\n   - Azura: Black Star vs. Azura’s Star—The Black Star feels less pious, but either counts. Which fits archivist vibes better?\n2) Routing advice to reach 15 artifacts while skipping 1–2 “too evil” quests. Is there a reliable path that doesn’t force Skull/Namira/Boethiah?\n3) Early-game survival with no crafting: best early staves/scroll sources and a sensible follower?\n   - Thinking Brelyna (Dunmer scholar synergy) or Illia/Erandur (if spared) for theme.\n   - Any unique early robes or rings that help a control/healing playstyle without enchanting?\n4) House rules to keep it fun: I’m planning “turn in” artifacts to a display chest at the College/Temple as if they’re quarantined. Any other RP rules you’ve enjoyed for a curator/archivist run?\n5) Missables/pitfalls: Any Daedric quest ordering to avoid locking myself out, and any “don’t pick this dialogue” landmines under a no-crafting constraint?\n\nI’m playing AE on Xbox, no mods, Survival off, Adept/Expert difficulty. Would love a recommended artifact checklist and a rough quest order that preserves the archivist RP without making me feel like I joined a cult of serial killers. Thanks!  \nsubreddit: r/skyrim",
  "title: Staff-only College of Winterhold run — route, mechanics, and missables?\n self_text: I want to finally commit to a pure staffmage playthrough and I’d love route/mechanics sanity checks from people who’ve done something similar.\n\nRules I’m setting for myself:\n- No casting spells at all (no wards/armor/cantrips) — only staves and scrolls for offense/utility\n- Healing via potions/food only\n- Robes/clothes (no armor rating), jewelry allowed\n- Melee only for bashes to create space; no traditional weapons\n- Followers allowed but prefer ones who won’t steal all my kills\n\nPlanned early game route (open to changes):\n- Join College ASAP for access to Enthir (seems to sell staves reliably) and general mage vendors\n- Wabbajack early via Solitude “The Mind of Madness” (seems doable at low level)\n- Start College questline for Staff of Magnus midgame\n- “A Night to Remember” at 14+ for Sanguine Rose\n- “Waking Nightmare” for Skull of Corruption (torn on RP; do you usually justify killing Erandur for a staff-only run?)\n- Dragon Priests (both Skyrim and Solstheim) for their unique staves\n- Dragonborn DLC later for Tel Mithryn’s Staff Enchanter and Miraak’s gear/staff\n\nMechanics questions I can’t find definitive answers on:\n- Do Fortify School enchantments or any perks reduce staff charge use or boost staff damage, or are staves basically independent of your perk trees?\n- Does Soul Siphon (Enchanting) or any other perk restore charges on staff kills, or is recharging purely soul gems only?\n- Do Destruction “Augmented” perks, dual-casting, or Impact affect staves at all?\n- Do Black Book passives (e.g., Seeker of Sorcery) or Ahzidal/Ancient Knowledge-type effects meaningfully change staff potency/charges?\n- Any weird interactions with the Atronach Stone/Spell Absorption when you’re firing a staff? (Self-absorbing effects, misfires, etc.)\n- Followers and staves: Do they burn charges normally and refuse to recharge, making it a bad idea to hand them staves long-term?\n\nEarly staff sources I might be missing:\n- Court wizards/Enthir/Vendors — any reliable low-level dungeons with guaranteed staff spawns?\n- Any quest rewards that are quietly missable if you do things in the wrong order?\n\nBuild/perk support ideas:\n- Enchanting (for Staff Enchanter later), Alchemy (resource sustain), Speech (buying/selling/Intimidate to avoid fights)\n- What do you take defensively if you can’t cast flesh spells? Just Movement + Shouts + summons from staves?\n\nFinally, any RP-friendly justification you’ve used for the Skull of Corruption choice in a “staff collector” run? I’m tempted to allow it for theme, but open to alternatives if there’s a comparable staff I should prioritize instead.\n\nThanks for any route tweaks, mechanics clarifications, or “don’t miss this” tips!\n subreddit: r/skyrim",
  "title: You can only keep ONE Daedric artifact for an entire playthrough—what’s your pick and how does it shape your build/role‑play?\n self_text: Thought experiment for my next run: I’m limiting myself to a single Daedric artifact for the whole playthrough. Everything else gets left on the shrine, returned, or sold. No swapping later. Not worried about Oblivion Walker; this is about forcing interesting choices.\n\nWhat’s your one artifact, and how does it drive your build, quest choices, and day‑to‑day gameplay? I’m curious about both mechanics and role‑play.\n\nSome examples to spark ideas:\n- The Black Star/Azura’s Star for a true enchanter economy run (soul trapping every bandit, early game power curve).\n- Dawnbreaker for a vigilante of Stendarr/vampire hunter theme, leaning into Light armor + Restoration.\n- Ebony Blade for a shifty Whisper build (Illusion + two‑handed + “moral decay” RP).\n- Ring of Namira for a necro‑gourmet survival run (cannibal ritual stops, Alchemy, Namira cult RP).\n- Sanguine Rose for a conjurer who avoids personal violence, letting the dremora do the dirty work.\n- Wabbajack for pure chaos (embracing failure states and improvisation).\n- Mehrunes’ Razor for a sneaky assassin who worships RNGesus.\n\nIf you’ve tried something like this, what surprised you?

  "title: Help me route a “Dwemer Archaeologist” build to 100% masks/Barenziah/Aetherium + Oblivion Walker (no cannibalism)?\n self_text: Pitch: Scholar-explorer who documents ruins and recovers relics for museums/colleges, not a murder-hobo. Light armor, archery, alteration, restoration, a bit of lockpicking/sneak, limited smithing/enchanting (only to preserve/restore artifacts). Follower: Marcurio or Teldryn Sero. I want a clean route that minimizes backtracking while staying in-character.\n\nGoals\n- Thieves Guild mainline + No Stone Unturned (Stones of Barenziah)\n- All 8 mainland Dragon Priest masks + Konahrik\n- Lost to the Ages (Aetherium) + key Dwemer side content (Blackreach, Unfathomable Depths)\n- Oblivion Walker without Namira (no cannibal roleplay)\n- Minimal main quest until needed; no Dark Brotherhood\n\nHard roleplay rules\n- No assassinations or “for-fun” cruelty; avoid Daedric outcomes that require blatant evil\n- Prefer non-lethal/indirect solutions; take “preserve the relic” choices when possible\n- No crafting abuse loops; keep gear thematically appropriate (Nightingale/Guild gear early, Ancient Falmer/Dwarven curios later)\n\nQuestions\n1) Route/ordering:\n   - For Stones of Barenziah: is Diplomatic Immunity mandatory for the Thalmor Embassy stone, and is there any non-MQ way in post-quest? If I must advance MQ, where would you slot it so it lines up with other stones?\n   - Dragon Priest masks: I know Morokei is College-gated and Nahkriin is late MQ (Skuldafn). What’s a sensible sequence: College first for Morokei, then TG/Barenziah, then MQ to Skuldafn, then Konahrik cleanup?\n   - Aetherium: best time to hit Arkngthamz/Deep Folk Crossing/Raldbthar/Bthardamz while also grabbing Stones/masks to cut travel?\n   - Blackreach: good moment to descend (Nirnroot run, Dwarven Bow, Attunement Sphere, Oculory) without derailing the rest?\n\n2) Oblivion Walker with no cannibalism:\n   - My plan was to skip Namira entirely, ensure I take Masque of Clavicus Vile (not the Rueful Axe), and then grab both Hircine artifacts via the known method so I still reach 15. Is there any non-glitchy way to get 15 without Namira, or is the “both Hircine items” route basically required?\n   - Any RP-consistent alternatives people use (e.g., “study” the evil artifacts but immediately shelve them in a museum/home)?\n\n3) Gear and perks:\n   - Best “academic explorer” loadout you’ve enjoyed? I’m thinking Guild/Nightingale early, then maybe Ancient Falmer or a toned-down light set with Dwemer accents. Dwarven crossbow okay thematically, or stick to bows?\n   - Shouts to fit the vibe (Aura Whisper, Become Ethereal, Slow Time?) without forcing MQ progress too early.\n\n4) Missables/pitfalls:\n   - Any Stones that are notorious time-wasters if you don’t plan around faction/MQ gates?\n   - Quests that lock each other out or make a mask/artifact unobtainable if done in the wrong order?\n\nIf you’ve done a similar “curator” run, I’d love your exact route or a high-level loop (Hold-by-Hold sweep, when to hop to Solstheim, etc.).

Question: is there a way to snag the Daedric artifacts for Oblivion Walker without doing truly vile stuff, or is that just fundamentally at odds with the role-play?\n\nHere’s how I’m thinking about each quest, but I’d love community input, headcanon hacks, or mechanical tricks I’m missing:\n\n- Azura: Take Azura’s Star (feels “cleaner” than the Black Star). Seems fine.\n- Meridia: Absolutely on-brand.\n- Vaermina: You stop a nightmare plague. Fine.\n- Peryite: “The Only Cure” is purging a disease cult. Feels okay.\n- Sheogorath: Wabbajack is chaos, but the quest isn’t outright evil.\n- Sanguine: Drunken misadventure. Morally goofy, not evil.\n- Malacath: Helping the stronghold—arguably just.\n- Hermaeus Mora: Oghma Infinium is knowledge-from-a-daedra; squicky but not directly immoral to obtain. Acceptable?\n- Clavicus Vile: Sparing Barbas for the Masque feels like the humane/clever route.\n- Hircine: Both outcomes are gray. Which is more paladin-y—killing Sinding (monster-slaying, take Savior’s Hide as a “seized trophy”) or letting him go and taking the Ring as a tool to restrain lycanthropy?\n- Mehrunes Dagon: Razor requires killing Silus. That’s a hard no for a paladin as written. Any way to complete ethically and still get the artifact (answer seems like no)?\n- Boethiah: Requires sacrificing a follower. Also a hard no. Any non-sleazy workaround that doesn’t break RP or mechanics?\n- Namira: Ring requires cannibalism. I assume that’s an absolute line.\n- Molag Bal: Torturing/killing a priest. Also an absolute no-go.\n\nQuestions:\n1) If I skip Namira, Molag Bal, Boethiah, and Razor (by sparing Silus), is Oblivion Walker just off the table? Any patch/USSEP nuances or legit routes I’m overlooking?\n2) For Hircine, which outcome do you pick for a Stendarr paladin and why?\n3) Any RP-friendly mods that let me “sanctify,” seal away, or destroy artifacts after acquisition (so I can get the achievement but keep the character’s conscience clean)? Legacy of the Dragonborn style museum “under lock and key” also appeals.\n4) If you’ve done an oathbound paladin run, how did you handle these quests in-character?\n\nGoal is to stay true to the build without turning off half the game. I’m open to headcanon like “confiscate evil relics for safekeeping,” but I don’t want to outright torture, sacrifice, or eat anyone. Appreciate any advice!\n subreddit: skyrim",

Looking for route advice, quest picks/skips, and any tricks to maximize uniques without breaking the character.\n\nConstraints/goals:\n- Survival Mode, no fast travel (carriages/boats ok).\n- No intentional murders of named NPCs; unavoidable combat = ok vs dragons/undead/automatons/hostile bandits/creatures. Minimize human/mer kills in general.\n- Avoid “evil” Daedric deeds where possible, but I’d still like to grab as many artifacts/uniques as the ethics allow.\n- No Dark Brotherhood. Stay neutral in Civil War if that prevents lockouts. Become Thane everywhere and buy all houses.\n- Minimize theft; I’ll pay bounties if I mess up, but want to avoid confiscation of uniques.\n\nWhat I’m thinking so far (please sanity‑check me):\n- Early housing/safe storage: Breezehome ASAP (Bleak Falls > Dragon Rising). Then Riften (Skooma Trade > Honeyside), Markarth (Jarl favor > Vlindrel), Solitude (Man Who Cried Wolf > Wolf Queen Awakened > Proudspire), Windhelm (Blood on the Ice timing can be finicky—best way to trigger it early without Civil War progress?).\n- Stones of Barenziah: do a big clockwise loop to cut carriage costs (Whiterun > Riften > Windhelm > Winterhold > Solitude > Morthal > Markarth > Falkreath). Any efficient Survival‑friendly path y’all like?\n- Dragon Priest masks: Krosis during main quest mountain trip, then pair Labyrinthian with Staff of Magnus, and swing to Nahkriin with MQ. Best order to minimize backtracking?\n- Guilds: Thieves Guild for access/fences but avoid violent side jobs; College for quests + easy uniques; Companions minimal (stop before lycanthropy if I can).\n- Illusion/Pacify + Calm/Harmony to walk through fights; let bandits fight each other if needed. Does killing via Frenzy count toward my “People Killed” stat or cause murder flags, or is it “clean” for stats/role‑play?\n- Speech/Alchemy/Alteration/Restoration core, with Pickpocket/Lockpicking for access. Any perk must‑haves for a non‑violent playstyle?\n\nDaedric artifact plan (am I missing cleaner routes?):\n- “Clean” or cleaner: Azura’s Star (Azura’s route), Meridia’s Dawnbreaker (undead only), Sheogorath’s Wabbajack, Clavicus Vile (Masque by sparing Barbas), maybe Vaermina (inevitable combat but not “murder”?).\n- Probably no‑go unless I relax rules: Boethiah (sacrifice), Namira (cannibalism), Molag Bal (torture/murder), Mehrunes’ Razor (requires killing Silus), Peryite (Orchendor kill). Any non‑murder completions I’m overlooking? For Hircine, can I resolve it without personally killing Sinding or the hunters and still get one artifact?\n\nOther practical questions:\n- Best early gold routes for house money that don’t force murders (alchemy loops, rare book runs, safe radiant quests)?\n- Bounty management: if I accidentally steal an owned unique, is there a clean way to pay the bounty without losing it?\n- Any Survival pitfalls with this route (cold zones during Stones runs, carry weight for books/uniques) and how you mitigate them?\n\nWould love to see your quest orders, city loops, and any “gotchas” that break pacifist/curator vibes.

Best to do it early, before Civil War city captures or Season Unending jarl swaps.\n- The Whispering Door (Whiterun): requires level 20 and Balgruuf’s kid (Nelkir). If Whiterun flips to Stormcloaks and Vignar takes over, this can lock out. So either stay Imperial, or delay taking Whiterun for Stormcloaks until after this quest.\n- The Forsworn Conspiracy/Cidhna Mine (Markarth): stash gear before arrest, do both parts back‑to‑back.\n- Season Unending: jarl shuffles can temporarily block thane/favor steps; safer to either finish Civil War before it or delay the main quest until you’ve done sensitive city content.\n- Leveled items to delay: Chillrend (46+), Nightingale set (32+), Dragonbane (46+), Nightingale Blade/Bow (higher tiers later).\n- Daedric choices:\n  • A Daedra’s Best Friend: take the Masque (counts for Oblivion Walker and fits “good” RP).\n  • Ill Met by Moonlight: is the both‑artifacts method (Ring + Savior’s Hide) still working on AE PS5?\n  • Pieces of the Past: must kill Silus for Razor—one RP compromise.\n  • Taste of Death / House of Horrors: unavoidable moral hits if going for all artifacts.\n\nTentative route idea (carriage‑friendly):\n- Whiterun intro (Dragon Rising), Breezehome for stash, plant seeds for Survival.\n- Early Windhelm to knock out Blood on the Ice; don’t flip Whiterun yet so I can do Whispering Door at 20.\n- Riften early just to start No Stone Unturned with Vex; collect stones over the whole run, finish TG late (32+).\n- Markarth double‑feature (Forsworn Conspiracy > Cidhna Mine), then Dawnguard’s Lost to the Ages for Aetherial Crown (Steed + Lover stones flexibility).\n- Solitude/Morthal/Falkreath for Daedric starters, but save leveled rewards until target levels.\n- Finish Civil War and Season Unending after city‑sensitive quests are done.\n\nQuestions:\n- What quest order would you run to minimize missables?

Looking for feedback on quest order, must-have uniques/staves, Standing Stones, and especially how to handle dragons/priests without Destruction or crafted gear.\n\nRules/goals\n- Difficulty: Legendary\n- No crafting skills: no Enchanting, Smithing, or Alchemy (buying potions/soul gems is OK; using pre-enchanted uniques is OK)\n- No followers (summons/staves allowed), no tempering, no gear crafting other than quest-forged Aetherial items if that’s not considered “crafting”\n- Shouts allowed; stealth incidental, not a sneak archer pivot\n- Race: Altmer (for theme + Highborn); open to Breton if it’s night-and-day on survivability\n\nPlanned skills/perks\n- Illusion: all the way up (Animage, Kindred Mage, Aspect of Terror, Hypnotic Gaze, Rage, Quiet Casting, Master of the Mind, Dual Casting)\n- Alteration: Mage Armor 3/3, Stability, Magic Resistance, maybe Atronach\n- Conjuration: Atromancy, Elemental Potency, Summoner, Twin Souls (Dremora/Summons do the killing); Bound Bow as a last-resort dragon solution if needed\n- Restoration: Recovery, Ward Absorb (for Apprentice/Atronach stone synergy and priest fights)\n\nEarly → mid → late gear (no player-enchanted items)\n- Early: Radiant Raiment Illusion/Alteration robes, Diadem of the Savant, Gauldur Amulet or Savos’ Amulet\n- Core: Arch-Mage’s Robes, Morokei, Ring of the Erudite (if I go Vampire/Volkihar), Aetherial Crown, Staff of Paralysis, Staff of Magnus, Sanguine Rose, Wabbajack\n- Late/optional: Miraak’s Robes (tentacles + decent regen), Ahzidal’s Ring of Arcana (Ignite/Freeze utility), good pre-enchanted rings/amulets for magicka/regen\n\nProposed quest order (to delay dragons and power up control)\n1) College of Winterhold asap for vendors + Illusion/Alteration training; push to Staff of Magnus/Morokei\n2) The Mind of Madness (Wabbajack) early\n3) The Black Star for infinite staff charging\n4) A Night to Remember at 14 for Sanguine Rose\n5) Dawnguard Volkihar path for Ring of the Erudite (is Vamp worth it for this build on Legendary?)\n6) Lost to the Ages for Aetherial Crown (which stones pair best here?)\n7) Only then start main quest; keep dragon spawns off until I have staves + Twin Souls\n\nStanding Stones\n- Debating: Atronach vs Lord vs Apprentice (with Ward Absorb/Staff of Magnus to manage incoming spells)\n- With Aetherial Crown, thinking Lord + Apprentice, or Atronach + Lover early for leveling. What’s the safest combo on Legendary without crafted resists?\n\nKey pain points I need help with\n- Dragons: Is Sanguine Rose + Storm Atronach staff + occasional Bound Bow enough, or do I need a different plan? Any shout combos that shine for a control mage?\n- Dragon Priests: Best control routine without potions or Destruction nukes?\n- Must-have uniques I’m missing that boost Illusion/control viability without player-enchanting\n- Vamp vs non-vamp: is Ring of the Erudite worth the sunlight pain on Legendary for a no-crafting mage?\n- Any tweaks to perk spread that pay off more than, say, deep Restoration vs going harder in Conjuration\n\nIf you’ve done a no-crafting Legendary mage, I’d love a tried-and-true quest order and your stone/staff picks. I want the run to feel strong through control/summons and smart routing, not raw damage. Thanks!\n subreddit: skyrimbuilds",
  "title: Planning a no‑Daedra, pro‑Imperial Altmer run — what missables/quest gotchas should I plan around?\n self_text: I’m sketching a new Skyrim playthrough and want to get my ducks in a row before I brick any content.\n\nBuild rules:\n- Refuse all Daedric quests/pacts (including Nocturnal + Hermaeus Mora in Dragonborn)\n- Side with the Imperials\n- Destroy the Dark Brotherhood\n- Minimal theft/pickpocket (prefer persuasion/Illusion)\n\nQuestions:\n1) Stones of Barenziah — Is the Thalmor Embassy stone truly missable after Diplomatic Immunity? Any clean, non‑glitch way back in? Also, can I complete No Stone Unturned without fully doing Thieves Guild (i.e., just enough to talk to Vex/enter the Flagon)?\n2) Words of Power — Are any Words/shouts locked behind Thieves Guild/Dark Brotherhood/Daedric content, or am I safe to skip those lines entirely?\n3) Dark Brotherhood destroy route — What uniques do I permanently lose (Windshear, Ancient Shrouded set, Shadowmere?) and is there anything still obtainable on the destroy path?\n4) Dragonborn DLC — If I refuse Mora, the MQ stalls. If I skip it, do I lock myself out of any non‑Mora shouts/gear? Any “lore‑friendly” stopping point for a Mora‑averse character?\n5) Other true missables for this roleplay (locations that close, artifacts that vanish, achievements I’ll forfeit). Oblivion Walker is obviously gone; what else should I expect to lose?\n\nGear/quest suggestions that fit the vibe:\n- College of Winterhold > Arch‑Mage Robes/Morokei\n- Dawnguard’s Lost to the Ages for Aetherial gear (as a non‑Daedric alternative to Spellbreaker)\n- Illusion/Speech “diplomat” kit ideas (calm/frenzy/fear + persuasion routes)\n- Civil War beats that feel Thalmor‑adjacent without forcing me to slaughter every Justiciar\n- Best peaceful resolution for Missing in Action as an Imperial\n\nIf anyone has a spoiler‑light “do X before Y” checklist (e.g., grab the Embassy stone during DI), I’d really appreciate it.

  "title: Oblivion Walker in 2025 AE: any remaining gotchas? Here’s my plan—poke holes in it\n self_text: Starting a fresh AE run (all CC content), USSEP only, and I want to cleanly get Oblivion Walker without locking myself out or fighting the well-known bugs. Can you sanity-check this plan and flag any 2025 AE/USSEP quirks I might have missed?\n\nGeneral notes I think still apply\n- Skeleton Key doesn’t count. Creation Club artifacts don’t count.\n- Level gates to remember: Sanguine (14), Mephala/Whispering Door (20), Boethiah (30). Others are rumor/discovery-gated.\n- Do Whispering Door before you mess with the Civil War/Whiterun swap to be safe.\n- If The Cursed Tribe gate is weird at Largashbur, approach from the west, wait for the giant event, talk to Atub (USSEP mostly fixes this but I’m cautious).\n\nMy artifact choices (15+)\n- Hircine (Ill Met by Moonlight): Ideally get BOTH Ring of Hircine + Savior’s Hide. Does USSEP in 2025 still allow the double-artifact route? If not, I’ll just take Savior’s Hide and fill elsewhere.\n- Clavicus Vile (A Daedra’s Best Friend): Take the Masque. Don’t kill Barbas; Rueful Axe doesn’t count.\n- Mehrunes Dagon (Pieces of the Past): Kill Silus for Mehrunes’ Razor.\n- Namira (The Taste of Death): Side with Eola, eat Verulus to get the Ring of Namira.\n- Azura (The Black Star): Either version counts; I’ll likely take The Black Star for utility.\n- Peryite (The Only Cure): Spellbreaker.\n- Vaermina (Waking Nightmare): IMPORTANT—kill Erandur at the end to get the Skull of Corruption.\n- Sheogorath (The Mind of Madness): Wabbajack.\n- Sanguine (A Night to Remember): Sanguine Rose (grab this soon after 14).\n- Molag Bal (The House of Horrors): Mace of Molag Bal (do this early in Markarth).\n- Meridia (The Break of Dawn): Dawnbreaker (random Beacon find or buy from Radiant Raiment; I’ll just run the quest when it pops).\n- Malacath (The Cursed Tribe): Volendrung.\n- Mephala (The Whispering Door): Ebony Blade (do at 20, pre-Civil War to avoid rumor hiccups).\n- Boethiah (Boethiah’s Calling): Ebony Mail (I’ll use a disposable merc/bandit follower).\n- Hermaeus Mora (Discerning the Transmundane): Oghma Infinium (I know the old exploit is patched; not relevant to the cheevo).\n\nOrder I’m thinking about (flexible, mostly for level gates and convenience)\n- Early: House of Horrors, Cursed Tribe (if the event triggers), Break of Dawn (whenever Beacon shows), Mind of Madness, Black Star/Azura.\n- Mid (14–20): Sanguine (14), Waking Nightmare (Skull), Masque of Clavicus Vile, Mehrunes’ Razor, Taste of Death.\n- Level 20: Whispering Door for Ebony Blade.\n- 20+: Ill Met by Moonlight (try for both artifacts), Spellbreaker, Mace of Molag Bal if not done.\n- 30+: Boethiah’s Calling.\n- Anytime alongside MQ: Discerning the Transmundane/Oghma (I’ll sync with Elder Knowledge).\n\nQuestions for 2025 AE/USSEP vets\n1) Can you still reliably get both Ring of Hircine + Savior’s Hide on USSEP? If not, which single one is safest to count?\n2) Is Whispering Door still safest to start before the Whiterun Jarl swap, or fully fixed now?\n3) Any Cursed Tribe/Largashbur edge cases still around in AE that need a specific approach?\n4) Any rumor triggers (e.g., Sanguine) acting weird on AE that you’ve had to nudge by sleeping/waiting/leveling?\n5) Any other “make the wrong choice and you lose the artifact” moments I’m missing besides: Rueful Axe, sparing Silus, sparing Erandur?\n\nIf you’ve got an updated 2025 “golden path” or a couple of small mod-side effects I should avoid, I’d love the pointers.

  "title: Legendary viable no‑crafting Ranger/Hunter — what quest order/gear keeps it fun past level 30?\nself_text: I want to do a pure Ranger/Hunter run that doesn’t lean on the “big three” (no Smithing, Enchanting, or Alchemy at all — not even tempering), on Legendary, without living in perma-sneak. Bow-focused with a light blade as backup, some traps/kiting, and a survival/woodsman vibe.\n\nConstraints/allowances:\n- Difficulty: Legendary\n- Skills: Archery, Light Armor, Sneak (no invis spam), a dash of Restoration for heals; no crafting trees\n- Shouts okay; followers okay; purchased/looted potions/poisons okay; no crafting benches (tempering/fortifying) at all\n- DLC is fine; Creation Club Survival is a maybe\n- RP: more Kyne/Forsworn-hunter energy than Thieves Guild/DB assassin\n\nI’m looking for:\n1) Early/mid game route that doesn’t feel miserable on Legendary:\n   - My tentative start: Guardian Stone → Lover (or Lord), do Angi’s Camp for free archery training, grab Bow of the Hunt (Clearspring Tarn), Froki’s “Trials of Kyne” for Kyne’s Token, then Zephyr (Arkngthamz) as a tempo boost. Is that doable without overleveling or hitting brick walls?\n   - Any cleaner path to a solid bow without TG/DB? Nightingale/Ancient Shrouded feel off-theme. Is Auriel’s Bow worth rushing on Legendary, or should I wait?\n\n2) Gear targets that don’t require crafting:\n   - Masks like Krosis for +Archery (risky early). Good light sets I can reasonably loot (Glass via high-level bandits? Guild gear alternatives that fit RP?). Favorite Fortify Archery pieces you reliably find?\n   - Jewelry/quests that matter: Gauldur Amulet, Agent of Mara, Savior’s Hide (iffy RP), Hircine’s Ring (for flavor, not werewolf).\n\n3) Stone/shout synergy for a bow user with no enchants:\n   - Stones: Lover vs Lord vs Steed? Atronach Stone for mage-heavy dungeons on Legendary, or is the casting penalty too annoying if I’m only self-healing?\n   - Shouts I’m planning: Become Ethereal (reposition), Slow Time (if I can find all words), Marked for Death (boss melt), Aura Whisper (scouting), Whirlwind Sprint (gap open/close). Any underrated picks?\n\n4) Followers that complement a no-crafting archer:\n   - Early: Faendal/Jenassa. Mid: Aela/Derkeethus/Mjoll? I want a frontliner who doesn’t break stealth every fight but can actually tank on Legendary. Loadouts you like that don’t require me to craft/temper?\n\n5) Problem enemies and answers without potions I craft myself:\n   - Falmer/dwarven spheres/dragons/priests: Do I just accept a lot of kiting and line-of-sight snipe wars, or are there specific dungeons/quests that give me tools to handle these without cheese?\n   - Any vendor-bought potion types you prioritize to offset the lack of enchants (Fortify Marksman, Resist/Restore, etc.) and where you reliably buy them?\n\nBonus rules opinions:\n- Is Aetherial Crown “allowed” on a no-crafting run if I only smith it at the Aetherium Forge as part of the quest? It’s thematically perfect (Lover/Lord swap) but technically crafting.\n\nIf you’ve done a similar run, I’d love your quest order, “must-grab” items, and any Legendary-specific tips that keep it engaging rather than a stealth one-shot simulator.

I’m trying to avoid painting myself into a corner with hold/jarl swaps, quirky prerequisites, or buggy side quests.\n\nRules/goals\n- No Main Quest past the intro (ideally don’t trigger Dragon Rising so dragons never spawn)\n- Neutral in the Civil War\n- Survival Mode on\n- No crafting (no smithing/alchemy/enchanting), minimal power creep\n- No fast travel (carriages/boats okay)\n- Become Thane of every hold and buy all houses/plots if possible\n- Achievement-safe (vanilla/AE only)\n\nQuestions for the hive mind\n1) Order of holds: What’s the least headache order to knock out Thane titles given jarl swaps and quest flags? I’m thinking Whiterun last (to keep dragons off permanently). Any holds I should do early/late for safety?\n2) Hidden gates: \n   - Solitude: Is Elisif’s Tribute still mandatory for Thane, and does anything in MQ/CW gate it if I’m staying neutral?\n   - Riften: Do I still need to run the skooma chain to unlock Honeyside/Thane, or are there alternate triggers?\n   - Winterhold: Best three citizen helps that don’t require College progress? (I remember this one being tight.)\n   - Falkreath: Any difference in requirements depending on who’s Jarl if I never pick a side?\n   - Windhelm: Does Blood on the Ice timing still matter for becoming Thane, and does avoiding CW keep it stable?\n3) Radiant pitfalls: Any assist-the-people favors that can bug out or become impossible in Survival (e.g., escorts or far-flung deliveries) that I should skip/replace?\n4) Survival pain points: Without crafting or fast travel, what’s your go-to money/gear progression? I’m considering:\n   - Early Thieves Guild for fences/gold without crafting\n   - Kolskeggr gold run, treasure maps, and cleared-ruin loot loops\n   - Steed Stone vs. camping perks for carry weight/QoL\n5) Role-play boundaries: I’d like to minimize Daedric involvement.

  "title: Paladin Archivist run: can I hit “Oblivion Walker” without breaking Lawful Good RP? Map my cleanest path\nself_text: I want to do a “contain the evil” role‑play: a Lawful Good Archivist of Stendarr who secures Daedric artifacts to lock away, not to use. Ground rules:\n- No murder of innocents; no torture, cannibalism, or human sacrifice.\n- No betraying allies/followers.\n- Minimal theft; only to “secure/contain” an artifact, nonviolently.\n- No glitches/exploits, no follower-death cheese.\n\nHere’s my current take, quest by quest:\n- Meridia (Dawnbreaker): yes, clean.\n- Azura (Azura’s Star vs. Black Star): leaning Azura’s Star. Moral difference or just flavor?\n- Sanguine (Sanguine Rose): yes; mischief, I’ll repay damages.\n- Sheogorath (Wabbajack): yes; mostly harmless therapy in Pelagius’ mind.\n- Malacath (Volendrung): yes; help the tribe, kill a giant.\n- Clavicus Vile (Masque): yes if I spare Barbas; Sebastian is a conjurer/menace.\n- Hermaeus Mora (Oghma Infinium): reluctant yes; Septimus’ end isn’t by my hand.\n- Hircine (Ring/Savior’s Hide): leaning “kill Sinding” as justice, take Savior’s Hide. Is sparing him and killing hunters actually worse RP‑wise?\n- Peryite (Spellbreaker): on the fence—mercy‑killing the Afflicted vs. slaughtering victims. Any nonlethal or alternate completion I’m missing?\n- Mephala (Ebony Blade): acquire to contain it, never “feed” it. Opening the Whispering Door via pickpocket—acceptable under my containment clause?\n- Vaermina (Skull of Corruption): seems like a pass if it requires killing Erandur; any clean route I’m missing?\n- Molag Bal (Mace): hard pass (torture/murder).\n- Boethiah (Ebony Mail): hard pass (follower sacrifice + murders).\n- Mehrunes Dagon (Mehrunes’ Razor): pass if Silus must die.\n- Namira (Ring of Namira): hard pass (cannibalism).\n\nQuestions:\n1) What’s the max artifact count you’ve pulled off with a genuinely LG RP? I’m seeing 9–10 if Spellbreaker and “containment” Blade are allowed.\n2) Any edge cases that still feel in‑character (e.g., alternate outcomes, pacifying, letting guards/hostiles handle unavoidable kills without it being my deed)?\n3) Hircine: is there a non‑exploit, non‑betrayal justification to get both artifacts, or is that inherently off‑limits for LG?\n4) Does the community view Azura’s Star vs. Black Star as ethically distinct, or just mechanics?\n\nIf Oblivion Walker isn’t possible without breaking character, I’ll skip it this run.

Concept: Dunmer, ex–Telvanni apprentice who values knowledge > honor, pragmatic to the point of ruthless, hates the Thalmor, unimpressed by Nord piety, fine with morally gray solutions if they further research.\n\nBuild vibes\n- Skills: Conjuration/Illusion/Alteration/Destruction; staves; Bound Sword/Bound Bow; robes or light armor.\n- Crafting: Moderate Enchanting and Alchemy; minimal Smithing unless it serves a narrative (Dwemer tinkering).\n- Home base: College early, ultimately Severin Manor + frequent time at Tel Mithryn.\n\nGoals/constraints\n- Clear College of Winterhold and Dragonborn DLC thoroughly (Black Books, Ahzidal, Kagrumez, Miraak’s set).\n- Daedric artifacts that make sense for a Telvanni: Hermaeus Mora (Oghma Infinium), Black Star (over Azura’s), Boethiah, Mephala, maybe Vaermina, Sanguine, Sheogorath. Probably skip Hircine/Companions lycanthropy.\n- I’m achievement-curious (Oblivion Walker), but I don’t want to blow up the RP to tick boxes. Happy with “most” if some don’t fit.\n\nOpen questions where I’d love your takes\n- Civil War: Join Imperials (stability and better prospects for Windhelm Dunmer) or stay aloof entirely as “above petty Nord/Empire squabbles”? If Stormcloaks, how would you justify it?\n- Main quest pacing: Delay Dragon Rising until after becoming Arch‑Mage, or rush shouts early for survival/QoL before Solstheim?\n- Vampirism: On‑brand Volkihar scholar of ancient blood vs. sunlight annoyance. Worth it for RP/gameplay, or keep mortal and lean on Conjuration?\n- Thieves Guild/Dark Brotherhood: Is there a minimal TG route that unlocks useful fences without going full Nightingale? DB feels off-theme—agree or disagree?\n- Daedric yes/no list you’d run for this character (and any headcanon justifications).\n- Followers that fit: Teldryn Sero, Brelyna Maryon, J’zargo, Illia. Anyone else feel right for a Telvanni exile?\n- Quest order: What sequence keeps the RP strong while lining up with Solstheim/Neloth/Mora beats?

Not worrying about CC stuff this run.\n\nWhat I’ve flagged so far (please correct/add!):\n\nDaedric/artifact choices and Oblivion Walker pitfalls\n- Clavicus Vile: take the Masque, not the Rueful Axe (axe doesn’t count for Oblivion Walker).\n- Azura: Azura’s Star vs The Black Star — pick one (both count, but only one per run).\n- Ill Met by Moonlight: ring vs Savior’s Hide — normally one or the other; there’s a way to get both, but I’m assuming “no exploits.”\n- Mehrunes’ Razor: must kill Silus to get the Razor (sparing him locks you out).\n- Namira: you have to side with the cannibals to get the Ring.\n- Everything else (Wabbajack, Dawnbreaker, Spellbreaker, Mace of Molag Bal, Sanguine Rose, Ebony Blade, Oghma, Ebony Mail, Black Books etc.) is straightforward timing-wise.\n\nFaction route locks (uniques tied to choices)\n- Dawnguard: \n  - Vampire side = Harkon’s Sword (unique). \n  - Dawnguard side = Dawnguard Rune weapons and enhanced crossbows (Radiant rewards/crafting). Looks like you can’t get both sets in one legit run.\n- Dark Brotherhood:\n  - Join DB to access “Locate the Assassin of Old” (Ancient Shrouded Armor). Destroying the DB route forfeits this set.\n  - Blade of Woe is obtainable on either route (join or destroy), so that one’s safe.\n- Thieves Guild:\n  - Return the Skeleton Key if I want the achievements (locking myself out of “keep unbreakable lockpick” meme).\n- Civil War:\n  - Mostly cosmetic/world-state for collectibles; flagging only for Ebony Blade trigger (Whiterun Jarl’s kid still starts Whispering Door in either outcome after Dragon Rising).\n\nBig missables/time‑sensitive pickups\n- Stone of Barenziah in Thalmor Embassy: grab it during Diplomatic Immunity (access is basically gone afterward).\n- Blood on the Ice/Hjerim: do the quest chain before buying Hjerim to avoid weirdness; pick up the Strange Amulet (becomes Necromancer Amulet).\n- The Pale Lady: decide whether to return or keep the Pale Blade — mutually exclusive versions.\n- Aetherium: Crown/Shield/Staff — one choice only.\n\nLeveled unique gear to delay until max tier\n- Chillrend: max version at level 46+.\n- Dragonbane: max at 46+.\n- Nightingale: armor best at 32+; blade/bow best at 46+.\n- Shield of Solitude: best enchant at 40+ (reward timing matters).\n- Any other notable leveled uniques I should delay?\n\nAchievements/gotchas\n- Oblivion Walker: don’t pick Rueful Axe; make sure I end up with 15 artifacts total (accounting for the mutually exclusive ones above).\n- One with the Shadows: requires fully restoring the Thieves Guild (so Skeleton Key must be returned).\n- Thu’um Master: ensure access to all word walls given chosen factions; nothing hard‑missable, just keep a checklist.\n- Anything else achievement‑related that can be bricked by choices?\n\nQuestions for the hive mind\n- Are there any other “pick one only” uniques I’ve missed (DLC or base)?\n- Any faction/radiant quest rewards that quietly become unobtainable based on route?\n- Any other Stones of Barenziah–style one‑window pickups?\n- Known AE/PS5 bugs that make an item/quest fail to spawn unless you do it in a specific order?\n\nThanks!

Looking for a clean plan that fits the role‑play, avoids missables, and keeps the combat loop fun without crafting.\n\nRole‑play premise:\n- Former Thalmor Justiciar who defects after Helgen. Publicly “cooperates” with the Empire but sabotages Thalmor influence from the shadows. Backs the Blades, restores the Thieves Guild’s influence to fund anti‑Thalmor ops, helps the College for cover.\n- Morally gray but not a wanton murderer. Will destroy the Dark Brotherhood. Open to some Daedric deals if they serve the bigger goal.\n\nBuild constraints:\n- No crafting: 0 Smithing/Alchemy/Enchanting. Quest/found gear only.\n- Skills: Illusion (Muffle/Invisibility/Calm/Frenzy), Conjuration (Bound Bow + Dremora/atronachs), Sneak, Light Armor optional, a bit of Restoration/Alteration for utility.\n- Stones: leaning Atronach (absorb vs mages), or Apprentice for faster leveling early.\n- Shouts: Become Ethereal, Slow Time, Throw Voice for heists.\n\nGear path ideas (open to tweaks):\n- Early: Fine Thalmor robes for flavor until College robes; Bound Bow ASAP.\n- College early for Arch‑Mage’s Robes + access to key spells. Morokei/Nahkriin later for mage stats; Krosis for archery if I lean on Bound Bow.\n- Thieves Guild → Nightingale set for stealth/magicka sustain midgame. Thieves Guild fully restored for RP and gold flow (no crafting means I’ll be cash‑starved).\n\nCollectibles/achievements I want to hit:\n- Oblivion Walker (15 artifacts, AE/PS5): plan to take Masque of Clavicus Vile (not the axe), Ebony Mail, Mace of Molag Bal, Dawnbreaker, Sanguine Rose, Wabbajack, Skull of Corruption, Mehrunes’ Razor, Spellbreaker, Oghma Infinium, Ebony Blade, Namira’s Ring, Ring of Namira conflicts with RP but maybe tolerable for the goal, Hircine item(s), Azura/Black Star. Skeleton Key doesn’t count.\n- Stones of Barenziah and TG restoration.\n- Dragon Priest masks culminating in Konahrik if feasible.\n\nRoute questions for the experts:\n1) Quest order: What’s a smart sequence that:\n   - Grabs the Thalmor Embassy Stone of Barenziah during Diplomatic Immunity (to avoid the re‑entry headache),\n   - Frontloads College (Illusion/Conj vendors, Arch‑Mage gear) without overleveling combat,\n   - Slots in Thieves Guild early for gold/lockpicking perks and Nightingale midgame,\n   - Times Daedric quests so I don’t get stuck (e.g., Taste of Death, The Whispering Door level gate)?\n2) Hircine double‑artifact on AE PS5: Does the method to obtain both Savior’s Hide and Ring of Hircine still work, and what’s the reliable step order on console right now? If it’s patched, which other artifact should I prioritize to comfortably reach 15?\n3) Ebony Blade counting: In AE/PS5, does the Ebony Blade reliably count for Oblivion Walker? Any pitfalls with starting “The Whispering Door” late?\n4) RP‑friendly picks: Given the defector vibe, which artifacts feel least immersion‑breaking while still letting me hit 15? I’m fine with Molag Bal for the greater good, but any clever alternatives to minimize outright cannibalism for Namira?\n5) No‑crafting mage survivability: Best found/quest gear progression for Illusion/Conj that helps with magicka costs and sustain? Arch‑Mage + Atronach Stone enough, or should I pivot to Nightingale + Mage’s Circlet/rings and lean on Atronach perks?\n6) Stones of Barenziah gotchas: Besides snagging the Embassy stone during the MQ, any other timing warnings (e.g., Proudspire purchase, quest locks in Markarth) that I should plan around?\n7) Followers: I generally run solo with summons, but I know Boethiah wants a sacrifice. Any recommended “expendable” follower who won’t break other questlines or RP?\n\nCombat loop I’m aiming for:\n- Infiltrate with Muffle/Invisibility, Calm/Frenzy to keep hands clean, Bound Bow for surgical picks, atronachs/Dremora as force projection only when plans fail. Destroy DB, side with Blades, discreetly undermine Thalmor whenever possible.\n\nWould love a tight checklist or sample route that hits these beats without painting me into a corner.

  "title: Moral Oblivion Walker run: Is 15 Daedric artifacts possible without cannibalism, torture, or betraying quest NPCs?\n self_text: I want to do a role‑play/achievement run that stays “mostly good” while chasing Oblivion Walker, but I’m running into roadblocks. My constraints:\n- No killing named non‑hostile NPCs (self‑defense is fine).\n- No cannibalism.\n- No follower sacrifice.\n- No torture/enslavement.\n- No big glitches/console commands; minor QoL exploits are negotiable if the community considers them “RP‑safe.”\n\nMy tentative route and questions:\n\nClean/OK (as far as I know):\n- Azura: Azura’s Star (choose Azura’s route).\n- Meridia: Dawnbreaker.\n- Clavicus Vile: Return the Rueful Axe, take the Masque (no killing Barbas).\n- Hermaeus Mora: Oghma Infinium (harvest blood from existing corpses to avoid murders).\n- Sheogorath: Wabbajack.\n- Sanguine: Sanguine Rose.\n- Peryite: Spellbreaker.\n- Malacath: Volendrung.\n- Mephala: Ebony Blade (take it but don’t “feed” it on friends).\n- Hircine: Help Sinding and spare him to get the Ring of Hircine — can someone confirm you still receive the Ring for siding with Sinding and killing the hostile hunters only?\n\nProblem quests under my rules:\n- Mehrunes Dagon: Mehrunes’ Razor seems to require killing Silus (named, non‑hostile).\n- Molag Bal: Mace of Molag Bal requires torturing/killing Logrolf.\n- Vaermina: Skull of Corruption requires betraying/killing Erandur.\n- Namira: Ring of Namira requires cannibalism.\n- Boethiah: Ebony Mail requires sacrificing a follower.\n\nIf I skip the five above, I’m capped around 10–11 artifacts, which won’t hit 15. So:\n\n- Is there any legitimate, non‑murder/non‑cannibal path I’m missing that still counts toward Oblivion Walker?\n- Does sparing Sinding 100% grant the Ring of Hircine without any “gotchas”?\n- Are there RP‑friendly workarounds the community accepts (e.g., pre‑patch Hircine double‑dip, specific versions/mods that let you spare key NPCs and still get credit)?\n- If 15 is impossible under these constraints, what’s the “closest” moral route you’ve done, and which of the “bad” choices felt least egregious from an RP perspective?\n\nI’m on a fresh Anniversary Edition save.

  "title: Trying a “no‑murder, basically‑good” Skyrim run — is Oblivion Walker actually possible? Cleanest routes for each Daedric quest?\n self_text: I’m planning a role‑play run where my Dragonborn won’t murder non‑hostile NPCs (self‑defense vs bandits/undead/dragons/hostile cultists is fine, no cannibalism/human sacrifice). No mods/console, SE/AE.\n\nI’d love to grab as many Daedric artifacts as possible, ideally hit Oblivion Walker if there’s any legit way without crossing hard lines. From what I remember:\n\nSeems “clean” to complete:\n- Azura (Azura’s Star) — only kills are hostile inside the Star\n- Meridia (Dawnbreaker)\n- Clavicus Vile (Masque, spare Barbas)\n- Sanguine (Sanguine Rose)\n- Sheogorath (Wabbajack)\n- Peryite (Spellbreaker)\n- Malacath (Volendrung)\n- Mephala (Ebony Blade; no kills to obtain, I won’t “feed” it)\n- Hermaeus Mora (Oghma Infinium)\n- Hircine — I can spare Sinding and take the Ring; I assume getting both Ring + Savior’s Hide requires killing Sinding, so that’s out\n\nSeemingly require murder/evil acts to get the artifact:\n- Molag Bal (you’re forced to beat Logrolf to death)\n- Namira (cannibalism + killing Brother Verulus)\n- Boethiah (sacrifice a follower)\n- Vaermina (must kill Erandur for the Skull)\n- Mehrunes Dagon (kill Silus to get the Razor)\n\nQuestions:\n1) Are there any AE/SE‑era legitimate routes that avoid personally murdering innocents for the above five yet still grant the artifacts? e.g., engineered “accidents,” making them turn hostile first, letting guards/NPCs/dremora do the final blow, etc. (Not looking to use console/mods.)\n2) Is there any way to get both Hircine artifacts without killing Sinding in this patch?\n3) If true no‑murder makes 15 artifacts impossible, what’s your “least‑evil 15” if I relax it to “only kill truly irredeemable villains/cultists who attack first”? Which of the five “dirty” quests is the most defensible to complete, RP‑wise?\n\nBonus: Any gotchas with Oblivion Walker tracking (e.g., Rueful Axe not counting, Skeleton Key excluded) I should watch for so I don’t bork the achievement near the end?\n\nThanks!

  "title: Planning a no‑craft Legendary+Survival “Collector” run — optimal quest order to snag all artifacts (Daedric + masks) without nasty lockouts?\n self_text: I want to do a fresh Skyrim run focused on collecting unique items and checking off achievements, but with some constraints to keep it spicy and RP‑friendly. Looking for an optimized route and “danger spots” to avoid on Legendary + Survival (AE/PS5).\n\nRun goals:\n- Oblivion Walker (15 Daedric artifacts) without hard‑locking myself via quest choices.\n- All Dragon Priest masks + Konahrik (and the Wooden Mask detours).\n- Aetherium quest reward that best fits no‑craft play.\n- Optional: Black Books, Auriel’s Bow, notable uniques (Chillrend, Champion’s Cudgel, etc.).\n\nRules/restrictions:\n- Legendary + Survival (no fast travel, cold, carry weight concerns).\n- No crafting trees (no Smithing/Enchanting/Alchemy), cooking allowed.\n- No major exploits/quest bugs; QoL sequence breaks are fine.\n- I’m okay with followers; not sure about heavy conjuration (see Sanguine Rose question).\n\nWhat I think I know (please correct me if wrong):\n- Oblivion Walker requires 15. Skeleton Key and Rueful Axe don’t count. Savior’s Hide and Ring of Hircine can sometimes both be obtained; not sure if AE/PS5 still allows this and whether both count.\n- Namira (Taste of Death) and Vaermina (Skull of Corruption) are the big “morality” outliers; would love a list of 15 that avoids killing Erandur and avoids cannibalism, if possible.\n- Delaying returning the Skeleton Key doesn’t block Nightingale gear, but I’m fuzzy on the best timing in Survival where lockpicks are pain.\n\nTargeted questions:\n1) Early power spikes: which artifacts are safest to prioritize on Legendary+Survival? I’m thinking Dawnbreaker, Spellbreaker (mid), Mace of Molag Bal, Wabbajack, Azura’s/Black Star. Anything I’m underrating?\n2) Hircine: Is the “get both the Ring and Savior’s Hide” method still working on current AE/PS5, and do both count toward OW? If not, which one is smarter for no‑craft Survival?\n3) Namira/Vaermina avoidance path: Can I still reach 15 without those two? Which set is the least janky to secure (e.g., Dawnbreaker, Sanguine Rose, Volendrung, Mehrunes’ Razor, Spellbreaker, Ebony Blade, Ebony Mail, Wabbajack, Azura/Black Star, Oghma Infinium, Mace of Molag Bal, Spellbreaker, Ring/Hircine, Dawnbreaker, Sanguine, etc.) — would love a definitive “safe 15” checklist.\n4) Quest order to minimize dangerous backtracking: Any city‑by‑city route you like for Survival? (I’m thinking Whiterun → Falkreath (Hircine) → Markarth (Molag Bal, Namira if doing it) → Riften (start Thieves) → Dawnstar (Vaermina if doing it) → Solitude (Meridia) → Winterhold (Azura) → Blackreach (Oghma), with carriages where possible.)\n5) Mask run timing: Best points to grab high‑risk dungeons (Ragged Flagon route for Chillrend, Labyrinthian/Morokei, Volsung’s watery lair in Survival, etc.)? Any masks that are unusually lethal on Legendary and should be delayed?\n6) Aetherium reward for no‑craft: Crown seems king (Lord/Steed/Apprentice swaps), but Shield/Staff fans on Survival?\n7) Follower/stone picks for no‑craft Survival: I’m leaning Breton + Lord Stone for magic resist, with early Steed Stone until carry perks kick in. Followers: early Lydia > later Serana > anyone better for Legendary?\n\nMy tentative opening:\n- Breton start, Warrior/Thief stone early, swap to Steed, then Lord once gear stabilizes.\n- Bleak Falls → Whiterun business → Companions (for Skyforge access/levels, not crafting).\n- Wabbajack early (Solitude) for panic button. Azura’s Star (Winterhold) soon after.\n- Dawnbreaker after I can handle Kilkreath shades. Avoid Ebony Blade charges to keep RP clean.\n- Midgame: Spellbreaker (Only Cure), Mehrunes’ Razor (20+), Sanguine Rose (14+ if I decide summons are “allowed”), Volendrung (giants), Ebony Mail (30+).\n- Thieves Guild deepening while holding Skeleton Key until I’ve got a lockpick cushion.\n\nIf you’ve done a similar “Collector” run, I’d love:\n- Your exact 15 for Oblivion Walker that avoids the ugliest choices.\n- A city‑by‑city quest chain that’s Survival‑friendly.\n- “Gotcha” moments that can permanently lock you out or are spikes on Legendary (specific boss rooms, dungeon mechanics, or AE changes).\n\nThanks in advance — I want this to feel like a dangerous treasure hunt without turning into a reload simulator or an RP contradiction.\n subreddit: skyrim",
  "title: Least-evil path to Oblivion Walker? RP-friendly artifact route that still hits 15\n self_text: I’m planning a new Skyrim run where my character is a “university curator” type who collects Daedric artifacts to lock them away, not to serve the Princes. I’d love to snag Oblivion Walker without doing full-on monstrous stuff. For folks who’ve done this: what’s the least-evil route that still cleanly hits 15 artifacts on AE/USSEP?\n\nGround rules I’m trying to keep:\n- No cannibalism (Namira).\n- No outright torture/murder of innocents (Molag Bal’s priest, Silus if avoidable, random follower sacrifice for Boethiah).\n- Okay with self-defense, clearing hostile dungeons, and “containment” RP vibes (sealing artifacts away).\n\nSpecific questions:\n- Does simply acquiring the Ebony Blade (unpowered) still count toward the achievement? I’ve read you don’t need to feed it with “friend” kills, but want confirmation on current patches.\n- Hircine: Can you still get both Ring of Hircine and Savior’s Hide on AE with USSEP, or is the double-dip fully patched? If only one, which path feels least evil (help Sinding and kill attacking hunters vs. skinning Sinding)?\n- Vaermina: If I spare Erandur and destroy the Skull of Corruption, can I still reach 15 without Namira/Molag Bal? Or does skipping Skull force me into one of the “worse” quests anyway?\n- Mehrunes’ Razor: Any defensible RP justifications for stopping Silus (e.g., preventing Dagon’s resurgence), or is there a different artifact people usually take as the “one evil” instead?\n- Spellbreaker: wiping the Afflicted—do folks count that as morally gray-but-acceptable given Peryite’s plague?\n- Missables/order tips: best time to trigger The Whispering Door (Ebony Blade) around Civil War/Dragon Rising? Any gotchas with Azura’s Star vs. Black Star choice for an ethical run?\n\nTentative “cleaner” list I’m eyeing: Azura’s Star, Dawnbreaker, Wabbajack, Sanguine Rose, Spellbreaker, Volendrung, Masque of Clavicus Vile, Oghma Infinium, Ebony Blade (unfed), Ebony Mail (questionable…), Hircine item (one), plus Razor/Skull/Namira as flex.

  "title: Pacifist Illusionist/Conjurer build that can finish MQ + Dragonborn — need perk/gear rules and “what counts” advice\n self_text: I want to role‑play a scholar who refuses to deal direct damage but still completes the Main Quest and Dragonborn. Ground rules I’m considering: no melee/bow/Destruction/poisons/trap cheese; crowd‑control via Illusion is okay; damage only via conjured allies, followers, environmental chain reactions I didn’t cause on purpose; shouts allowed if non‑lethal (e.g., Become Ethereal, Clear Skies). Edge cases I’m unsure about: Unrelenting Force cliff yeets, Bend Will making others fight for me, Wabbajack chaos, Sanguine Rose/Dremora doing the killing, and whether staff damage “counts” as mine. What would you allow for a consistent pacifist RP?\n\nGoals: finish Alduin line while sparing Paarthurnax, and complete Miraak with Hermaeus Mora doing the deed. For dragon souls, I’m fine letting guards/followers/atronachs get the last hit. I’d like to keep Dawnguard optional, but if there’s a low‑kill route there, I’m open.\n\nInitial build sketch: Breton or Altmer. Standing Stone: Lord for survivability or Apprentice for regen; avoiding Atronach due to self‑absorb ruining summons. Core perks: Illusion up to Master with Dual Casting, Animage/Kindred Mage, Hypnotic Gaze/Rage, Quiet Casting, Master of the Mind (for undead/daedra). Conjuration to Twin Souls with Atromancy/Elemental Potency; likely atronachs or Dremora as primary damage. Support: Alteration (Mage Armor 3, Stability), Sneak (Silence) for setup. No Archery/Destruction.\n\nGear thoughts: Archmage’s Robes early, then custom Fortify Illusion/Conjuration to hit 0 cost; Resist Magic/Muffle on boots; Morokei or a high‑magicka circlet; Ring of the Erudite if vamping. Staves I’m debating: Sanguine Rose feels on‑theme; Wabbajack maybe too lethal/random for “pacifist.”\n\nQuestions for folks who’ve done similar: any quest roadblocks where Illusion won’t carry (high‑level draugr, automatons, Apocrypha Seekers)? Best summon mix for late game without trivializing fights? Recommended follower who won’t nuke stealth? Any must‑grab items I’m missing, and a clean perk spread around level 40–50?

Any must-hit houses/shops for clean burglaries that don’t turn into combat disasters?\n- Perk priorities: Sneak/Lockpicking/Pickpocket/Speech/Illusion picks that matter most early so it feels rewarding fast (e.g., Bribery/Persuasion vs rushing Misdirection/Perfect Touch vs Invisibility timing)?\n- Survival Mode tweaks: Food/warmth routes for a thief playstyle without crafting—inn reliance, specific cloaks/sets to target, or travel patterns that don’t brick the run with exposure?\n- Quest picks to accent the fantasy: Favorite non-lethal or low-lethality quests that pay well or feel “thiefy” (beyond the obvious TG core), and any stealth-friendly ways to handle main quest beats without turning it into a murderhobo detour?\n- Gear goals without crafting: Sets/uniques that meaningfully change the feel (Thieves Guild/Nightingale are obvious—any other sleeper picks or enchantless items that carry their weight)?\n- House or stash strategy: Best safe stashes to avoid owning property, or is buying Honeyside/Shadowfoot Sanctuary worth it for RP and logistics?\n\nOpen to self-imposed rule tweaks if you think I’m over-restricting in a way that kills the fun.

  "title: Can a true pacifist run (0 kills, no proxies) finish vanilla Skyrim? Looking for route + mechanics clarifications\n self_text: I want to do a vanilla AE pacifist run that keeps General Stats → Kills at 0 and also avoids “proxy” kills (no followers, summons, frenzy, traps, or physics yeets doing the dirty work). Is this actually doable without cutting the main quest entirely, or is there a community‑accepted “near pacifist” route I should aim for?\n\nMy ground rules:\n- Vanilla AE (no mods), no followers/summons/pets.\n- No Frenzy/Command, no leading enemies into traps, no Unrelenting Force cliff tosses, no poisons. Basically: calm/invis/sneak/CC to disengage, not to kill.\n- Allowed: Calm/Pacify/Harmony, Fear, Invisibility, Muffle, Become Ethereal, Slow Time, Disarm, Paralysis strictly for escapes, bribery/persuasion.\n\nKey questions I can’t find consistent answers for:\n1) Dragon Rising: If the Whiterun guards kill Mirmulnir, do I still absorb the soul and progress with 0 kills? Same for Sahloknir at Kynesgrove—can Delphine or guards take the kill, and does the game ever force the player to land a final blow?\n2) Main quest endgame: Can the three heroes in Sovngarde actually finish Alduin without me landing a hit, and will the quest complete? Or is at least one player‑registered hit mandatory?\n3) College of Winterhold: Is Jyrik Gauldurson in Saarthal a mandatory player kill, or can Tolfdir finish him? Same question for Ancano—can Tolfdir/the Eye’s explosion handle it, or does the player have to do lethal damage?\n4) Thieves Guild: Is Mercer Frey scripted to require a player kill, or can Karliah/Brynjolf/“the environment” finish him without it counting to me?\n5) Daedric/Misc: Which Daedric quests are 100% non‑lethal? Can Ill Met by Moonlight be completed without killing Sinding OR hunters? Any gotchas like quests that won’t advance unless the player personally tags the target at least once?\n6) Kill counter weirdness: Does causing stagger/fall/environment damage (e.g., bumping someone who then falls) ever flag as a player kill? Any known bugged encounters that sneak a kill onto the stat even if you didn’t attack?\n\nRoute ideas I’m considering if true 0 kills is impossible:\n- Skip MQ after Dragon Rising (or skip entirely) and do: Bards College, Thieves Guild radiant jobs, Stones of Barenziah (sneak/invis only), No Stone Unturned, non‑violent misc favors, museum/collectibles runs, and exploring with strict disengage rules.\n- Avoid: Civil War, Companions, Dark Brotherhood, most Daedric, Dawnguard, Dragonborn, and probably College (unless someone vouches for kill‑free clears).\n\nBuild thoughts:\n- Illusion (Quiet Casting, Master of the Mind), Sneak, Speech (Bribery/Persuasion), Alteration (Paralysis for escapes, Mage Armor), Restoration (Wards, utility), Pickpocket (for plant/retrieve objectives). No crafting loop; gear is found/bought. Any standout non‑crafted gear for pacifists?\n\nIf someone has done a documented 0‑kill run (screens of the stat page + quest completions) I’d love to see your route and any specific fights where you had to do weird workarounds. And if the consensus is “true 0 kills can’t clear X/Y questlines,” what’s the cleanest accepted definition of pacifist the community uses (e.g., 0 humanoid kills, 0 direct damage, dragons exempt, etc.)?\n\nThanks—and if I’m over‑restricting (e.g., allowing guards to kill is fine by most), I’m open to loosening rules to match a well‑agreed community standard.\n subreddit: skyrim",

Any AE changes?\n- Azura vs The Black Star: Either counts, but which choice creates fewer conflicts down the line? I’m leaning Azura’s Star for RP.\n- Ill Met by Moonlight: Is the “get both Savior’s Hide and Ring of Hircine” method still consistent on current AE? If not, which feels less evil for a “containment” RP?\n- The House of Horrors (Molag Bal): No way around being awful to Logrolf, right? Any clever RP framing that doesn’t break Thaneship vibes?\n- The Taste of Death (Namira): Ring basically requires cannibalism. If I skip eating, do I lose the artifact entirely? Any route that lets me minimize the gross without missing Oblivion Walker?\n- Waking Nightmare (Vaermina): To get the Skull, I have to betray Erandur. If I spare him, am I forfeiting the artifact/achievement?\n- Boethiah’s Calling: Sacrificing a follower. Best practice is hiring a disposable mercenary, yeah? Any gotchas with Civil War or faction NPCs getting flagged?\n- Ebony Blade (Mephala): Powering it means killing “friends.” Any relatively consequence-free options that won’t ripple through quests? Or do you just live with it unpowered for RP?\n- Discerning the Transmundane: Best time to start/finish relative to Elder Knowledge/main quest so nothing flags weird? (Not interested in old Oghma exploits, just clean sequencing.)\n- A Night to Remember: Any timing issues with other questlines if I hold or rush this?\n- Civil War/Thaneships: Anything in the Daedric route that reliably causes bounty/hostility in holds I should avoid before becoming Thane?\n\nIf you’ve done a “Reluctant Champion” style run, I’d love:\n- A step-by-step order you used (even rough beats)\n- Which artifacts you purposely left “unpowered” or took the lesser-evil option for\n- Tips to keep bounties at zero and avoid killing named NPCs who matter later\n- Any AE oddities I should know about vs older guides\n\nBonus: If there’s a role-play headcanon that makes Namira/Molag/Mephala less of a gut punch without mods, I’m all ears.

I want as many unique items/artifacts as possible, but with some hard RP lines:\n\n- No cannibalism or human sacrifice\n- No torturing innocents or murdering “good” NPCs\n- Minimal theft (pickpocket ok if nonviolent, no killing to cover it up)\n- Bandits/necromancers/vampires/dragons/daedra cultists are fair game\n\nI’m trying to map what’s green/yellow/red for Daedric items and any alternate completions I might be missing.

Any alternate quest resolutions that make a “red” artifact actually palatable for a lawful-good run?\n2) For Hircine: can I confirm the ring is the reward if I HELP Sinding and only kill the hunters?

If I already own 1 of the week’s cards, I’m assuming unique-pull protection makes it feasible to get the new card in 2–3 opens; if I own 2, maybe 1–2 opens to snipe; if I own 0, I try to have 4 ready to full-clear.\n\nQuestions:\n1) Is this still accurate with current 2025 duplicate/unique-pull rules?

Any other MQ/CW order pitfalls I’m missing?\n- Faction order: Companions (beast form early, cure later if desired) > College > Thieves (finish for Guild Master, Stones/Paragon gems along the way) > Dark Brotherhood (late so bounties/travel lines don’t get annoying).\n- Dawnguard/Dragonborn: Side with Dawnguard for fewer NPC casualties, then ask Serana to turn me after MQ for Vampire Mastered. Werewolf Mastered via Companions before curing. Do Dragonborn when I’m strong enough; grab Black Books/Dragon Aspect/5 rides; craft any Stalhrim piece once Baldor is rescued.\n- Cleanup/trophies: Master Criminal via quick 1k bounties in each hold (any 2025-friendly method you like?). Reader/Delver/Explorer handled passively. Golden Touch by hoarding + Thieves Guild jobs. Word walls via Greybeards’ radiant quests + miscellaneous ruins; absorb 20 souls as I wander.\n\nQuestions:\n- Any true missables/bugged quests on AE PS5 I should front-load (Blood on the Ice, Stones in Thalmor Embassy return path, etc.)?\n- Confirm: Ring + Hide both still count for Oblivion Walker on current console patch?\n- Any smarter quest order that reduces backtracking or avoids faction conflicts?\nsubreddit: skyrim",
  "title: Help me map a “lawful good” Oblivion Walker route (AE, no mods) — least-evil 15 and optimal quest order?\n self_text: I’m starting a fresh Anniversary Edition run on PS5 (no console/mods) and want to 100% achievements on a single file while role‑playing a lawful good paladin. I know Oblivion Walker forces some moral compromise, but I’m hoping to minimize outright murder/cannibalism and avoid bugging anything. Looking for a clean route, order advice, and any AE‑specific gotchas.\n\nConstraints\n- AE 1.6 on console, no glitches that require saves/mods/console.\n- Role-play “good” where possible (no random murder, no cannibalism if there’s a legit alternative).\n- Still aiming for Oblivion Walker and all main/DLC achievements in one file.\n\nMy current artifact plan (cleanest picks)\n- Azura’s Star (Azura) — take Azura’s path.\n- Dawnbreaker (Meridia) — straightforward and very paladin-friendly.\n- Spellbreaker (Peryite) — kill Orchendor; morally gray but acceptable.\n- Volendrung (Malacath) — help the Orcs; fine.\n- Sanguine Rose (Sanguine) — goofy, no harm done.\n- Masque of Clavicus Vile (Clavicus Vile) — spare Barbas, refuse the Rueful Axe.\n- Wabbajack (Sheogorath) — chaos but not evil.\n- Oghma Infinium (Hermaeus Mora) — harvest blood from existing corpses only.\n- Ring of Hircine (Hircine) — help Sinding, spare him.\n- Ebony Blade (Mephala) — acquire but do NOT “feed” it.\n\nThe unavoidable “dark five” to reach 15\n- Ring of Namira (Namira) — requires cannibalism.\n- Ebony Mail (Boethiah) — requires sacrificing a follower.\n- Mace of Molag Bal (Molag Bal) — kill Logrolf.\n- Mehrunes’ Razor (Mehrunes Dagon) — kill Silus at the shrine.\n- Skull of Corruption (Vaermina) — kill Erandur.\n\nQuestions for folks who’ve done this recently on AE\n1) Can you still legitimately get both Hircine artifacts on AE console (help Sinding for the Ring, then return and kill him for Savior’s Hide), or is that fully patched? If it still works, that lets me skip one of the “dark five.”\n2) Any legit, non-exploit alternatives I’m missing that let me avoid cannibalism for Namira or avoid the Boethiah follower sacrifice? I’m fine with tough skill checks, persuasion, or using existing corpses; not fine with glitches.\n3) Of the “dark five,” which do you consider the least morally egregious for a paladin RP, and why? My current order of “most forgivable” is: Razor (Silus), Skull (Erandur), Peryite already listed as clean, then… Molag Bal, Boethiah, and Namira last. But I’m open to arguments.\n4) Quest order tips to avoid lockouts/bugs?\n- The Whispering Door sometimes has trigger weirdness — any reliable checklist beyond being 20+ and post-Dragon Rising?\n- Pieces of the Past: any AE quirks if you picked up Razor fragments early?\n- Any civil-war/Season Unending timing that can mess with Daedric quest NPCs or locations?\n- Oghma Infinium: any AE caveats with the blood harvesting from pre-existing corpses?\n5) Achievement sanity checks:\n- Rueful Axe doesn’t count, correct?\n- Skeleton Key doesn’t count, so I should return it.\n- Ebony Blade counts even if unempowered, right?\n\nIf you’ve done a “good-guy Oblivion Walker” recently, I’d love to see your exact 15, your ordering, and any AE patch notes you ran into. Bonus points for RP-friendly justifications for the necessary evils or suggestions for “least-harm” choices (e.g., which follower to use for Boethiah if I absolutely must do it).

  "title: No‑Crafting Dawnguard Purist on Legendary (Restoration + Crossbow) — looking for clean gear/quest order and survival tips\n self_text: I want to do a Dawnguard RP run that punishes undead without leaning on the big three crafts. Looking for a practical progression that feels “pure” but still clears Legendary without save‑scumming.\n\nConstraints/Theme:\n- Legendary difficulty\n- No Smithing, Enchanting, or Alchemy (no crafting benches, no homemade pots/enchants)\n- No Soul Trap use; I’ll only use already‑filled gems I find to recharge if absolutely necessary\n- Join Dawnguard (no Volkihar), avoid Thieves/Dark Brotherhood\n- Open to discussion on Daedric artifacts: does accepting Dawnbreaker break the RP, or is “destroy undead” on‑brand enough?\n- Playstyle: Restoration “sun” spells + Crossbow. Heavy armor Dawnguard aesthetic. Will swap to Auriel’s Bow with Sunhallowed Arrows vs undead if that’s not considered crafting/cheese for the theme.\n\nCore questions:\n1) Early game survival: What’s a reliable path to avoid faceplanting vs Master Vampires and Gargoyles without alchemy/enchants? Specific shout pickups, stones, and quest buffs you’d prioritize?\n   - My current plan: Lord Stone (or Atronach?), do The Book of Love early for 15% magic resist, then sprint to Dawnguard content for Sun Fire/Vampire’s Bane/Stendarr’s Aura. Any must‑grab shouts besides Slow Time/Become Ethereal?\n2) Spell/gear vendors: Best way to get the sun Restoration spells ASAP without joining the College? Can Fort Dawnguard vendors cover Sun Fire/Vampire’s Bane/Stendarr’s Aura soon after recruitment, or should I just grab Colette’s inventory at Winterhold and bounce?\n3) Crossbow + bolts: With no crafting, is sticking to steel bolts viable all game on Legendary? Any good gold routes to keep Sorine’s stock funded, or loot spots with heavy bolt drops you like to hit between quests?\n4) Followers/pets: I’m planning to buy the armored troll from Gunmar for the midgame. Any other thematic companions that don’t clash with the RP? Is running with Serana “allowed” if I frame it as a necessary alliance, or is that too immersion‑breaking for a Stendarr‑minded character?\n5) Quest order: What’s a clean Legendary‑viable route that front‑loads survivability without breaking the theme? I’m thinking:\n   - Get Lord Stone + Book of Love\n   - Start Dawnguard → crossbow + basic sun spells\n   - Hit a couple barrow dungeons for gold/loot, then focus Dawnguard mainline until Auriel’s Bow\n   - Optional: Meridia’s quest if community says Dawnbreaker fits the RP\n   Anything you’d change to minimize pain spikes (e.g., Volkihar courtyard gargoyles, Vyrthur, random Master Vamp encounters)?\n6) Armor and trinkets: Without enchanting, what light/heavy Dawnguard‑aesthetic sets or unique pieces carry hardest on Legendary? Any rings/amulets you always keep an eye out for (restoration cost, archery, magic resist) that are consistently obtainable?\n\nSkill plan (rough):\n- Archery main; Restoration to Adept for Stendarr’s Aura/Vampire’s Bane; Heavy Armor; some Block for when I swap to shield + Sun spells in tight spaces. No crafting trees at all.\n\nAny tried‑and‑true Legendary setups for this exact constraint set would be hugely appreciated, especially:\n- Specific vendors and level thresholds for buying the right spells\n- Gold routes that don’t break RP (no Thieves Guild)\n- Bolt economy tips and when to pivot to Auriel’s Bow\n- Perk breakpoints that really smooth the difficulty curve\n\nThanks in advance. I’ve done plenty of powercrafted runs—trying to make this one live or die on positioning, sun magic, and good quest timing instead.\n subreddit: r/skyrimbuilds",
  "title: Oblivion Walker in AE: what are the actual missables in 2025, and a clean one-playthrough route?\n self_text: I’ve failed Oblivion Walker three times over the years thanks to boneheaded choices (took the Rueful Axe, spared Silus, let Erandur destroy the Skull… and yes, I missed the Thalmor Embassy Stone of Barenziah once). Starting fresh on PS5 Anniversary Edition, vanilla. Before I dig in, can you sanity-check what’s truly missable and whether my plan below makes sense?\n\nQuestions\n- Which choices still lock you out of artifacts that count? My understanding:\n  - Take Masque of Clavicus Vile (Rueful Axe does NOT count).\n  - Kill Silus at the end of Pieces of the Past to get Mehrunes’ Razor (sparing him = no artifact).\n  - During Waking Nightmare, kill Erandur when prompted to keep the Skull of Corruption (letting him finish destroys it).\n  - Ill Met by Moonlight: does the “get both Ring of Hircine + Savior’s Hide” method still work on AE/1.6? If not, which is safer to pick for the 15?\n  - Azura’s Star vs The Black Star: either one counts.\n  - Ebony Blade and Skeleton Key don’t count toward the achievement, correct?\n- Any sequencing/beta-proofing tips in AE?\n  - Grab the Stone of Barenziah in the Thalmor Embassy during Diplomatic Immunity or accept it’s a pain later.\n  - Do The Whispering Door before you mess with Whiterun’s Jarl via the Civil War? (I’ve heard rumors about it bugging out depending on who’s Jarl/if you’ve done Dragon Rising.)\n  - Bring a disposable follower for Boethiah’s Calling; essentials won’t work.\n  - Any AE/Creation Club content that changes these quest states or artifacts counting?\n- Does the achievement still pop the instant you obtain the 15th artifact (no need to keep them all in inventory)?\n\nDraft one-playthrough route (feedback welcome)\n1) The Black Star (or Azura’s Star)  \n2) The House of Horrors (Mace of Molag Bal)  \n3) The Taste of Death (Ring of Namira)  \n4) The Cursed Tribe (Volendrung)  \n5) The Break of Dawn (Dawnbreaker)  \n6) A Night To Remember (Sanguine Rose)  \n7) Discerning the Transmundane (Oghma Infinium)  \n8) Pieces of the Past — KILL Silus (Mehrunes’ Razor)  \n9) Ill Met by Moonlight — if double-dip still works, get both Ring of Hircine + Savior’s Hide; if not, pick one  \n10) The Mind of Madness (Wabbajack)  \n11) The Only Cure (Spellbreaker)  \n12) Waking Nightmare — KEEP the Skull (kill Erandur at Vaermina’s prompt)  \n13) A Daedra’s Best Friend — RETURN the Rueful Axe, take the Masque of Clavicus Vile  \n14) Boethiah’s Calling (Ebony Mail)  \n15) The Whispering Door (Ebony Blade — doesn’t count, but I still want it; if I needed a 15th earlier, I’d reorder)\n\nMisc notes I’m tracking\n- Level gates: Boethiah (30), Break of Dawn (12 unless you find the Beacon), Whispering Door (20 + rumor + Dragon Rising?), Peryite’s Only Cure (10).  \n- Civil War timing: try to do Whispering Door before swapping jarls.  \n- Embassy Stone: grab it during Diplomatic Immunity to save yourself a headache.  \n- I’m not exploiting the old Oghma bookshelf glitch; just want a clean 100%.\n\nIf anything here is out-of-date for AE, or if you’ve got a safer route/order, I’d love to hear it.

  "title: Pacifist Illusionist run on PS5: how close to 0 kills can I get while still finishing the main guilds?\n self_text: I want to try a true pacifist Illusion/utility build on PS5 (vanilla, no mods) and see how close to 0 kills I can keep the stats while still finishing the big questlines. Looking for both mechanics knowledge (what counts as “my” kill in vanilla) and a smart quest order to avoid forced combat beats.\n\nBuild concept\n- Race/standing stone: Breton with Atronach or Apprentice (leaning Atronach for mage-heavy dungeons), Mage early then flip later if needed.\n- Skills: Illusion (Muffle/Invisibility/Calm line, Quiet Casting, Master Harmony), Alteration (Flesh line, Stability, Atronach perk optional), Restoration (Ward/Close Wounds, maybe Necromage just for duration), Speech (persuade checks), Pickpocket (disarm, remove arrows), Light Armor or pure clothing with flesh spells, Sneak for utility.\n- Gear: Fortify Illusion gear to hit 0-cost casting, Muffle boots, Fortify Alteration/Restoration where possible, stamina/magicka regen enchants. Shouts: Become Ethereal, Throw Voice, Aura Whisper, Kyne’s Peace.\n\nRules I’m aiming for\n- No direct damage from me. No Frenzy (morally gray and might still credit kills), no destruction, no bow chip damage. Prefer Calm/Fear/Paralyze, running past, or de-escalating with Speech.\n- Avoid letting followers rack up kills too; if unavoidable, I’d rather use guards or quest NPCs where the game might not assign the kill to me.\n- I’ll accept truly forced dragon/scripted boss kills if there’s no way around them, but I’d love to minimize those and avoid humanoid kills entirely if possible.\n\nQuestions for the mechanics nerds\n1) Dragon fights: For Mirmulnir (Western Watchtower) and Sahloknir (Kynesgrove), can I avoid getting the kill credit by letting guards/Delphine deliver the last hit, yet still absorb the soul for quest progression? Does that keep “People/Creatures killed” at 0?\n2) Alduin/Miraak/Morokei etc.: Which bosses absolutely must be killed by the player in vanilla, and which can be killed by NPCs without crediting me? Any known exceptions or cheese methods?\n3) Summons/commanded actors: If an Atronach kills, does that count as my kill in stats? What about using Calm/Command to turn an NPC briefly allied and they do the killing? Do guard kills after I Calm/Fear someone ever credit to me?\n4) College and main quest bottlenecks: Can Labyrinthian/Morokei be bypassed without me dealing damage? Any way through “Staff of Magnus” and “The Eye of Magnus” with 0 recorded kills? Are there draugr rooms I can sprint/invis past safely?\n5) Civil War/Season Unending: Is it possible to resolve the main story with Season Unending and skip large-scale battles (to avoid any accidental credit)? Any mandatory kills hidden in those sequences?\n6) Stat tracking: On console, is the General Stats “People killed/Animals killed” reliable for this challenge, or are there known bugs that add phantom kills?\n\nQuest order ideas (feedback welcome)\n- Start with Thieves Guild and Bards College (speech checks, sneaking, zero required kills).\n- Do Way of the Voice early; use Become Ethereal for traversal. Try to delay Watchtower Kynesgrove if possible until I’m sure about kill-credit tricks.\n- College next if it’s actually doable nonlethally; otherwise park it.\n- Dawnguard/Dragonborn probably a no-go for true pacifist, but if there are community-tested workarounds, I’m curious.\n\nRole-play flavor\n- “Temple mediator” vibe: resolves disputes, disarms bandits with Pickpocket, pacifies fights, heals citizens, collects books and nonlethal artifacts. No DB contracts, minimal Companions involvement.\n\nIf you’ve done a 0-kill or “no humanoid kills” run, I’d love your concrete do/don’t list, any specific encounters to watch for, and whether letting guards/NPCs handle bosses kept your stats clean.

  "title: Completionist-friendly quest order for AE (PS5, no mods) that avoids missables/NPC deaths?\n self_text: Starting a fresh Legendary run on AE (PS5), all Creations on, no mods/console so achievements stay enabled. I’m trying to plan a completionist route that:\n- Grabs all achievements, Daedric artifacts, Dragon Priest masks, Stones of Barenziah.\n- Minimizes permanently missable items and random NPC deaths in city battles.\n- Avoids common bugged quest states (AE/USSEP not installed).\n\nA few decision points I’d love advice on:\n- Civil War vs Main Quest: Better to fully finish Civil War early, or stop the MQ at Season Unending and postpone sieges to keep city NPCs safe? How does this interact with Windhelm’s “Blood on the Ice”?\n- Paarthurnax: Is the cleanest path simply never turning in “Paarthurnax” to Delphine/Esbern to keep him alive without breaking other content?\n- Dawnguard timing: Do it early for Auriel’s Bow/Arvak and better gear, or later to avoid dangerous vampire town raids while underleveled? Safer to side with Dawnguard for fewer town aggro incidents?\n- Dragonborn timing: Any AE/CC quirks if I head to Solstheim before finishing Thieves/DB/Civil War? Any Raven Rock NPCs I should protect early to avoid losing vendors/quests?\n- Markarth arc: When to run Forsworn Conspiracy/Cidhna Mine so I don’t complicate Taste of Death, Thieves Guild jobs, or buying Vlindrel Hall?\n- Blood on the Ice: What’s the cleanest trigger/checklist on AE to avoid the Calixto/Wuunferth confusion, and should I complete it before any Civil War progress touches Windhelm?\n- Daedric artifacts: Which quest choices are mutually exclusive (e.g., Hircine ring vs Savior’s Hide) and can I still do Oblivion Walker cleanly in one file on AE?\n- Stones of Barenziah: Any that become harder or gated after faction progress or city battles?\n\nMy tentative order (please roast/improve):\n- Early game: Helgen -> Bleak Falls -> Dragon Rising. Join Thieves Guild for fences, start collecting Stones and key shouts; pause MQ before Season Unending.\n- Do Blood on the Ice ASAP after proper triggers, before picking a Civil War side.\n- Companions line (don’t permanently lock myself into lycanthropy; plan to cure later).\n- Dawnguard (side with Dawnguard) for crossbows/Arvak; keep Serana parked when needed.\n- Finish Thieves Guild (incl. 5 jobs per city) before Civil War so city ownership doesn’t complicate radiant jobs.\n- Dark Brotherhood.\n- Either: finish Civil War now, then wrap MQ; or do Season Unending truce, finish MQ, and leave Civil War for last to minimize siege casualties. Leave “Paarthurnax” unturned.\n- Dragonborn near the end for Black Books/masks/unique gear.\n- Sweep Daedric quests and any remaining collectibles/CC artifacts.\n\nIf you’ve got a safer/more efficient sequence—especially around Windhelm/Markarth and MQ/Civil War timing—I’d love your optimized order and any AE-specific gotchas.

Playing on Legendary, permadeath, vanilla + DLC (no mods), no crafting. Would love advice on rules tweaks, quest order, and making Restoration/Sun damage actually pull weight without turning into kiting spam.\n\nProposed rules:\n- Skills: One-handed (maces), Block, Heavy Armor, Restoration (sun/turn), a bit of Speech. No Destruction/Conjuration/Illusion.\n- Gear: Found/bought only. No Smithing/Enchanting/Alchemy. Divine amulets, shrines, and scrolls allowed. Silver and Dawnguard weapons ok; no Daedric artifacts.\n- Factions: Join Dawnguard asap. No Thieves Guild/DB. College access only for buying Restoration tomes (no questline).\n- Conduct: Refuse/abandon all Daedric quests (incl. Meridia). No stealing. Mercy for non-hostiles. Cure any curses immediately (no vamp/werewolf).\n- Shouts: Allowed for utility (Whirlwind Sprint, Become Ethereal, Slow Time), avoid overtly \"evil\" powers. Open to debate here.\n\nEarly game plan (tell me if this is sane):\n- Helgen -> Whiterun for basic kit, then Ivarstead’s Shroud Hearth Barrow and Morthal’s Laid to Rest for undead practice.\n- Beeline to Fort Dawnguard to buy Sun Fire and, as soon as it’s available, Stendarr’s Aura/Vampire’s Bane.\n- Companion errands until Silver Hand locations open for early silver weapons. Prioritize Block perks (Quick Reflexes) and Necromage.\n- Main Quest to Greybeards early for Become Ethereal; pause before Dragonrend.\n\nOpen questions:\n1) Best reliable early sources of silver vs undead without rushing Companions too far?\n2) How do you get Restoration/Sun spells to feel impactful on Legendary without the Fortify Restoration exploit? Perk breakpoints, dual-cast usage, potion buys, standing stones?\n3) College vendor-only rule feel lore-friendly, or too immersion-breaking for a Vigilant?\n4) Quest order for a smooth difficulty curve with lots of undead (e.g., Laid to Rest -> Wolfskull -> Ansilvund -> Dawnguard beats)? What would you swap in/out?\n5) Any gotcha dungeons or enemy sets that tend to delete permadeath Vigilants that I should avoid until X level/perks?\n\nIf you’ve run this archetype, I’d love to see your perk spread at ~levels 20/40 and any must-have items/followers I’m overlooking.

  "title: No-crafting Imperial Legion Battlemage that holds up on Legendary (quest route, gear, and RP)\n self_text: Pitch\n- A sanctioned Empire battlemage who refuses crafting, fights on the front line in heavy armor, controls fights with spells, and leans on found artifacts (Spellbreaker + Dawnbreaker) instead of smithing/enchanting. Plays cleanly through the Civil War as Imperial and feels strong on Legendary without tempering.\n\nCore rules\n- Difficulty: Legendary after level ~10 (or from 1 if you like pain).\n- No perks in Smithing/Enchanting/Alchemy. No tempering or self-enchanting; use only found/bought potions and gear.\n- Use unique/quest gear and spell progression to scale instead of crafting.\n- Civil War: Imperial Legion.\n- Morality: “law-and-order mage” who hunts necromancers/Daedra worshippers… while pragmatically wielding their tools.\n\nRace, Standing Stone, Blessing\n- Race: Breton (25% magic resist + Dragonskin panic button).\n- Stone: Mage early, swap to Lord (25% armor + 25% magic resist) after you’re online. Atronach is tempting, but it can absorb your own conjuration and staff casts; avoid if you plan to use summons/staves.\n- Blessing: Talos (shout cooldown) or Arkay (health) early; Julianos mid-game if you want more magicka.\n\nSkills and key perks (no crafting trees)\n- Destruction: Novice–Expert, Augmented Flames/Frost/Shock as you prefer (I favor Fire for undead), Dual Casting + Impact for control.\n- Restoration: Novice–Adept, Regeneration, Recovery, Respite (stamina restore = endless shield bashes and power attacks).\n- Alteration: Novice–Adept for utility + Magic Resistance 3/3 (cap at 85% with Breton/Lord/Agent of Mara).\n- One-Handed: Armsman 5/5, Fighting Stance, Critical Charge; pick a weapon style you like.\n- Block: Quick Reflexes, Elemental Protection, Block Runner; Spellbreaker + bash lockdown is your anti-mage tech.\n- (Optional) Conjuration: just Novice + Bound Sword early for DPS before you get Dawnbreaker, then drop it if Atronach temptations arise.\n\nEarly game route (power without crafting)\n1) Helgen → Guardian Stones (Mage) → Whiterun: do Bleak Falls Barrow/Dragon Rising.\n2) Join College of Winterhold immediately for cheap spell access/training and the Saarthal run (starts Forbidden Legend).\n3) Complete Forbidden Legend for the Gauldur Amulet (+30 Health/Magicka/Stamina is huge for no-crafting).\n4) Do The Book of Love (Agent of Mara) for +15% magic resist.\n5) Start the Imperial Legion up to The Jagged Crown (Korvanjund has a Slow Time word).\n6) Grab the Lord Stone (east of Morthal) once you’re sturdy.\n7) At ~12+, “The Only Cure” for Spellbreaker (Peryite). Bring a Flawless Ruby, Deathbell, Vampire Dust, Silver Ingot.\n\nMid-game gear targets (all found/quest rewards)\n- Shield: Spellbreaker (ward on block trivializes mages/dragons).\n- Sword: Dawnbreaker (Meridia). Undead explode + Turn Undead aura = dungeon MVP.\n- Backup weapon: unenchanted Skyforge Steel or Nordic sword to use Elemental Fury shout when you don’t want Dawnbreaker’s enchant; or Dragonbane for dragons.\n- Neck: Gauldur Amulet early; swap to Julianos/Talos as needed.\n- Head/Body/Hands/Feet: any high-armor heavy set you think looks Imperial (Steel/Steel Plate/Imperial, then Ebony/Daedric if found). No tempering.\n- Rings: Fortify Destruction/One-Handed if you find them; otherwise Health/Magicka.\n- Staves: Staff of Fireballs, Sanguine Rose (artifact) for adds; be mindful if you ever switch to Atronach stone.\n\nSpells and shouts\n- Core spells: Firebolt/Fireball, Fire Cloak, Frost Rune for chokes, Fast Healing/Close Wounds, Ward (when you don’t want to raise Spellbreaker).\n- Alteration utility: Candlelight/Mage Light, Detect Life/Dead, Paralyze late-game.\n- Shouts: Slow Time (Korvanjund + Labyrinthian/Hag’s End later), Become Ethereal (safe heals + free casts + cloaks), Elemental Fury (with unenchanted blade), Unrelenting Force for spacing, Aura Whisper for dungeon sweeps.\n\nFollower options that fit the vibe\n- Early tank: Lydia or Mjoll. Magey option: Marcurio. Spellsword: Teldryn Sero (DB DLC). Give them found gear; no smithing required.\n\nRoleplay hooks\n- Empire-commissioned mage assigned to Skyrim garrisons.\n- Sides with law and stability; skeptical of Daedra but confiscates their artifacts “for the greater good.”\n- Supports the College (for regulation) and shuts down necromancer rings/dark cults.\n\nLate-game loop (Legendary viability)\n- Open with rune or cloak, bash-lock with Spellbreaker when pressured, weave Impacted Firebolts to pin casters/dragons, Respite-fueled stamina for infinite bashes/power attacks, Dawnbreaker for undead detonations. High magic resist + Spellbreaker = walk through most spell barrages without crafting crutches.\n\nAchievement/collection notes (if you’re chasing Oblivion Walker)\n- Easy pickups that fit the kit: Spellbreaker, Dawnbreaker, Sanguine Rose, Mace of Molag Bal, Mehrunes’ Razor (requires killing Silus), The Black Star (choose Black Star for recharging), Ring of Namira (RP conflict), Savior’s Hide OR Ring of Hircine (choose one). If you care about roleplay consistency, you can limit which you take and skip the achievement.\n- Civil War + College lines pair well with this build and won’t lock artifacts.\n\nQuestions for the sub\n- Any heavy-armor sets or uniques you love for a “Legion mage” look without crafting?\n- Would you ever bite the bullet and run Atronach Stone here if you drop all summons/staves, or is Lord simply better QoL?\n- Other artifact swaps that outperform Dawnbreaker/Spellbreaker on Legendary with no tempering?\n- Favorite Legion-friendly follower combos I should try?\n\nIf anyone wants, I can post a clean level-by-level perk spread and a minimal fast-travel quest order for a fresh start run.

  "title: Paladin of Stendarr going for Oblivion Walker — how would you justify the “worst” Daedric quests, and what order avoids gotchas?\n self_text: Doing a new run as a Vigilant/Paladin of Stendarr (Dawnguard-aligned, no murder/theft outside self‑defense, no human souls, no cannibalism, no sacrificing followers). The in‑character goal is “containment”: secure Daedric artifacts so they can’t corrupt Skyrim, then lock them away in a sanctified vault.\n\nI’d love help mapping an order and some role‑play justifications that keep the character consistent while still hitting the Oblivion Walker achievement.\n\nGround rules I’m trying to keep:\n- No killing friendly/innocent NPCs or followers.\n- No cannibalism.\n- No empowering the Ebony Blade (I can take it and seal it).\n- Prefer Azura’s Star over the Black Star (no human souls).\n- Use Dawnbreaker/Spellbreaker against undead/daedra; everything else gets stored.\n\nQuestions for folks who’ve done “holy containment” runs:\n1) The “hard line” quests — is there any non-evil path I’m missing, or RP justifications you’ve used?\n   - Namira (Ring): seems like hard no — you have to lure Verulus and participate. Did anyone headcanon a way around this while still getting the ring?\n   - Molag Bal (Mace): you’re forced to torment/kill Logrolf. Any way to frame this as a mercy/greater-good act, or is this a skip?\n   - Boethiah (Ebony Mail): requires sacrificing a follower. Have you ever justified this with a criminal/condemned volunteer in-character, or do you skip it?\n   - Mehrunes Dagon (Razor): requires killing Silus. Anyone RP him as a willing cultist/just execution under Vigilant law? Or skip?\n   - Vaermina (Skull): only get it by killing Erandur. Is there any believable reason a Stendarr paladin would do that?\n\n2) Hircine double-dip in AE/console: Is getting both Savior’s Hide and Ring of Hircine still possible on current Anniversary Edition (no mods), and do they both count toward the achievement?\n\n3) Order/level-gating and missables:\n   - Boethiah is level 30; Sanguine at 14; Clavicus at 10; anything else I should time so civil war or faction choices don’t lock me out?\n   - Any gotchas where doing one choice blocks another artifact? (I know Skeleton Key doesn’t count, Rueful Axe doesn’t count, etc.)\n\n4) If you were me, which 1–2 “sins” would you accept for the sake of sealing the artifacts, and how would you atone in-character afterward? I’m okay compromising on at most two quests if the RP is strong (e.g., temporary moral injury to prevent a bigger catastrophe, then penance).\n\nTentative “clean” list I’m thinking: Azura’s Star, Dawnbreaker, Spellbreaker, Wabbajack, Sanguine Rose, Masque of Clavicus Vile, Volendrung, Oghma Infinium, Ebony Blade (unfed), one or both Hircine artifacts. That still leaves me short of 15 unless I start crossing lines.\n\nHit me with your headcanons, quest orders, and any AE mechanics tips.

Can you sanity‑check my plan and fill any gaps?\n\nMy understanding:\n- There are effectively 16 countable artifacts if you get both Hircine items; Skeleton Key doesn’t count. You need 15, so you can only skip ONE Daedric quest if you also do the “both Hircine artifacts” trick.\n- That means I have to pick the single worst quest to skip and stomach the rest with the least‑bad choices.\n\nPlanned “least evil” choices per quest:\n- Hircine (Ill Met by Moonlight): Get BOTH Ring of Hircine + Savior’s Hide. As I recall, you help Sinding kill the hunters (good), receive the Ring, then kill Sinding for the Hide. That betrayal stings, but it lets me skip one truly vile quest. Is there any legit way to get both without betraying him? I’m guessing no.\n- Clavicus Vile: Return Barbas, take the Masque (no dog murder, no Rueful Axe).\n- Azura: Take Azura’s Star (not Black Star).\n- Meridia: Dawnbreaker, straightforward.\n- Sheogorath: Wabbajack, harmless enough.\n- Sanguine: Sanguine Rose, comedic chaos.\n- Peryite: Spellbreaker, just a fetch/cleanup job.\n- Malacath: Volendrung, help the Orcs set things right.\n- Hermaeus Mora: Oghma Infinium, unavoidable if I want 15.\n- Mephala: Ebony Blade — I’ll take it but won’t “power” it by murdering friends.\n- Mehrunes Dagon: Mehrunes’ Razor — have to kill Silus. Any clean RP tricks to make him hostile first (calm/frenzy/brawl) so it’s “self‑defense,” or does the script force a cold‑blooded kill?\n- Vaermina: Skull of Corruption — to get it I must murder Erandur (who’s actually trying to atone). This feels awful; might be my one skip if consensus says it’s the worst.\n- Molag Bal: Mace of Molag Bal — torture and kill Logrolf. Also awful; maybe THIS should be my skip instead?\n- Boethiah: Ebony Mail — requires sacrificing a follower. If I can only skip one quest total, who’s the “least bad” follower to use here (e.g., a Dark Brotherhood initiate/known killer)? Any non‑murder workaround? I think the pillar requires an actual death.\n- Namira: Ring of Namira — cannibalism + killing Brother Verulus. Feels like the most irredeemable.\n\nQuestions:\n1) If I get both Hircine artifacts, is my “only skip one” math still correct in AE? No new AE artifact secretly counts, right?\n2) Which single quest would you skip on a lawful‑good RP: Namira, Molag Bal, Boethiah, or Vaermina? Why?\n3) Cleanest RP mitigations:\n   - Dagon: any legit way to make Silus initiate hostility?\n   - Boethiah: any follower choice or timing that makes the sacrifice less morally egregious (without bugs/exploits)?\n   - Vaermina: any path to complete the questline without killing Erandur and still get an artifact? I think no, but asking.\n\nIf there’s a commonly accepted “paladin Oblivion Walker” route I’m missing, I’d love a checklist. Playing on current AE, no mods, no console. Thanks!\n subreddit: skyrim"
