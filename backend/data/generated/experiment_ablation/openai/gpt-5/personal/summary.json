  "title: Dating 6 weeks, seeing each other 2–3x/week — how do I ask to pause apps/define exclusivity without sounding controlling?\n self_text: 29F dating 31M for ~6 weeks. We met on Hinge and have been seeing each other 2–3x/week. He’s consistent, plans dates, texts daily, affectionate, and has made a few “future-ish” comments (concert in a month, meeting his friends at a group thing). Early on he said he wasn’t “seeing anyone seriously,” and I said I’m dating with intention, not casual hookups.\n\nHere’s my dilemma: I noticed he was “active today” on Hinge. I’m starting to catch real feelings and I’d like to either:\n- agree to be exclusive soon, or\n- at least pause apps while we keep getting to know each other and see if exclusivity makes sense.\n\nWe haven’t slept together yet. My boundary is that I don’t want to be physically intimate unless we’re exclusive + we both do recent STI testing. I can feel my anxiety ramping up trying not to read tea leaves, and I’d rather just communicate. I don’t want to come off as controlling or make it a big dramatic “what are we?” talk if it doesn’t need to be.\n\nLooking for:\n1) Scripts for how to bring this up in a straightforward, low-pressure way.\n2) What’s a reasonable timeline/norm here? Is 6–8 weeks and consistent weekly dates a fair time to ask?\n3) If he says “I’m not ready for exclusivity yet but I want to keep seeing you,” how would you proceed—mirror that and keep my options open, set a time frame, or take that as misaligned goals?\n4) Is suggesting “let’s both pause apps and focus on each other for a few weeks, then revisit exclusivity” a reasonable middle step?\n\nI’m in therapy and working on not letting old trust stuff run the show, so I want to be clear, kind, and boundaried. Would love sample phrasing and reality checks.\n subreddit: dating_advice",
  "title: NYC tenants: bedbugs + mice, landlord stalling—what actually moves the needle?\n self_text: Brooklyn, 16‑unit walkup, market‑rate 2BR. We’ve had mice on/off since winter and now a second round of bedbugs in late August. Management keeps sending a handyman with glue traps and a can of spray, says “exterminator came,” but there’s no prep sheet, no licensed PCO report, and no adjacent-unit treatment. I’ve spent $$$ on encasements, interceptors, laundry, sealing holes, etc. I’m done playing whack‑a‑mole and want to do this by the book.\n\nWhat I’ve done so far:\n- Notified management in writing (email + certified letter) with photos of mice droppings, bite marks, and a bagged bedbug sample.\n- Called 311 twice. HPD came for mice in July and wrote a violation; bedbugs inspection last week didn’t catch a live bug during the visit, so no violation on that.\n- Documenting daily with time-stamped photos/videos, logs of sightings, and all communication/receipts.\n\nQuestions for folks who’ve been through this in NYC:\n1) HP action in Housing Court: If I file an HP action for Order to Correct, how fast do things actually move? Did it force real IPM (sealing, licensed treatments, adjacent units) or just another spray-and-pray? Any tips on how to present evidence so the judge orders comprehensive remediation?\n2) Bedbugs evidence: For HPD to issue a violation, do they need to see a live sample during the visit, or will bagged specimens and interceptor catches count? Any timing tips for scheduling inspections so they’re more likely to see activity?\n3) Local Law 55/IPM: Has anyone successfully cited Local Law 55 (indoor allergen/pest) to push management into sealing entry points, repairing plaster, and doing multiple treatments? What wording worked in your letters?\n4) Rent withholding/abatement: I know not to just stop paying rent. Is there a safe way to seek abatement while staying current—e.g., stipulation via HP action? If you were market‑rate, did you get any reduction or reimbursement for prep costs?\n5) Retaliation/non‑renewal: Real‑world experiences? I know there are anti‑retaliation protections after complaints, but if you were market‑rate, did your landlord try to non‑renew? How did you handle it?\n6) Paper trail: Anything I’m missing beyond photos, logs, bagged samples, emails, certified letters, receipts? Should I get a brief doctor’s note for documented bites as supporting evidence?\n7) Resources: Any recommendations for clinics/lawyers or nonprofits who know NYC tenant pest cases? (Met Council on Housing, Legal Aid, Housing Court Answers—any specific offices or contacts you liked?)\n\nMy goal is to get proper treatment building‑wide (including neighbors) and sealing/repairs, not a one‑time spray. If HP action is the fastest way to make that happen, I’ll do it, but I’d love step‑by‑step advice, templates, and what actually worked for you. Thanks.\n subreddit: AskNYC",
  "title: 30F dating 32M for 2 months; he’s “not ready to delete the apps.” How do I set a boundary without blowing this up?\n self_text: Hi all. I’ve been seeing a guy (32M) for ~2 months (8 dates). We sleep together, text daily, and he’s taken me to a small group hang with his friends. I asked where he’s at and he said: “I’m not seeing anyone else, but I don’t want to delete the apps until it really clicks. I like you a lot and want to keep getting to know you.”\n\nThis left me stuck. I’m not looking to rush labels for the sake of it, but I don’t feel good investing and being intimate while someone keeps “options open.” I’m 30F, dating intentionally, and I’m fine walking away if we’re not aligned — I just want to communicate clearly and calmly.\n\nWhat feels fair/reasonable here? Is it okay to ask for exclusivity around the 2-month mark, or am I jumping the gun? If it is reasonable, how do I phrase it without making it sound like an ultimatum?\n\nDraft scripts I’m considering:\n- “I’m enjoying this and I’d like to be exclusive. If you’re not there yet, that’s okay, but I don’t want to keep sleeping together while you’re still on the apps. Totally fine to take a step back and revisit in a few weeks.”\n- “I’m looking for a relationship and exclusivity is my baseline for continuing. If that doesn’t match your pace, no hard feelings — I’ll step away.”\n- “I like where this is going, but the apps make me feel unsettled. If you’re unsure, I’d prefer we pause intimacy and keep things light until you know.”\n\nAdditional context:\n- He’s consistent with plans and communication, and hasn’t given me “player” vibes.\n- I’ve been burned before by someone who wanted “exclusive vibes” without actually committing, so I’m trying to protect myself without being reactive.\n- I’m not demanding a boyfriend label tomorrow, but I do want mutual exclusivity to continue being intimate.\n\nQuestions:\n- Is the boundary of “exclusive or let’s not keep being intimate” reasonable after 2 months?\n- Would you offer a timeframe (“happy to check in again in two weeks”) or just let him decide?\n- Any tweaks to the scripts so they land as calm, adult boundaries rather than pressure?\n\nThank you — trying to be clear, kind, and self-respecting here.\n\n subreddit: dating_advice",
  "title: How to bring up exclusivity + pausing apps after 2 months without sounding controlling? (F29/M31)\n self_text: F29 dating M31 for just over 2 months. We see each other 2–3x/week, have had a couple sleepovers, cooked dinner, and met a few of his friends. He’s consistent with texting and planning. We haven’t had a “what are we” talk, and we’re both still technically on the apps. I’ve been cheated on before, so I’m trying to balance protecting myself with not letting my anxiety run the show.\n\nI’m ready to ask for exclusivity and to pause/delete apps if we continue. I don’t want to come off as controlling, and I don’t want to “monitor” him. I just want a clear agreement so I can relax and invest without second-guessing.\n\nIs 2 months reasonable to ask for this? And is it fair to include “let’s pause the apps” in the exclusivity ask?\n\nWhat exclusivity looks like to me:\n- We’re not seeing or flirting with other people (including not going on dates)\n- We both pause/delete dating apps\n- We keep following whoever we already follow on social, but don’t slide into DMs/keep flirty chats going with exes\n- We get recent STI results before dropping barriers if that’s where things go\n\nDraft script I’m considering:\n“I’m really enjoying you and where this is going. I’d like to be exclusive. For me that includes pausing dating apps and focusing on each other. How do you feel about that? If you’re not ready, that’s totally okay—no pressure. I’ll keep things casual and won’t invest at the same level, but I’d love to know where you’re at.”\n\nIf he says he’s not ready or needs more time, my plan is to slow down sleepovers/physical intimacy and keep casually dating. Does that sound reasonable?\n\nAlso, is it overstepping to mention the part about flirty DMs with exes (I don’t want to dictate who he follows—just the behavior)? I’m trying to set a standard, not control a person.\n\nWould appreciate feedback on:\n- Tweaks to the script to keep it confident but kind\n- What’s reasonable to include in “exclusivity”\n- Red flags vs “give it a little more time”\n- Any phrasing that helps with my anxiety without making this a demand\n subreddit: dating_advice",
  "title: 3 months in, great vibes, but he’s still active on the apps — how do I ask for exclusivity without sounding controlling?\n self_text: I’m 29F, he’s 31M. We’ve been seeing each other for about 3 months, 2–3x a week. Sleepovers, cooking together, meeting a couple of each other’s friends, light “future planning” (tickets a few weeks out, a short weekend trip idea). Sex has been great and consistent, we use protection, and the overall vibe is easy and kind.\n\nHere’s the snag: a friend showed me he was “recently active” on Hinge. I didn’t snoop his phone or anything, but I felt my stomach drop. I’ve been cheated on before and I know I can spiral, but I also know I want to be exclusive if we’re going to keep being intimate and building something. I’m not looking to police his phone; I just want clarity so I can either lean in or gracefully bow out.\n\nIs it reasonable to ask for exclusivity at the 3-month mark when we’re acting couple-y? If so, how do I bring it up in a way that’s clear and calm, not accusatory or needy?\n\nWhat I’m thinking of saying (open to edits):\n“I’m really enjoying getting to know you and I’d like to date you exclusively. I’m not comfortable continuing to be intimate if either of us is still dating other people. If you’re not in the same place, that’s okay—no pressure—but I’d need to step back.”\n\nI’d prefer to do this in person, not via text, and avoid mentioning the app activity specifically so it doesn’t turn into a debate about that. I want to stick to my boundary rather than give an ultimatum.\n\nQuestions:\n- Is this wording solid? Any better phrasing that is clear but not confrontational?\n- If he says he’s “not ready” yet: what’s a fair timeline to revisit (2–4 weeks?), or is that usually a soft no and I should move on?\n- Should exclusivity include STI testing before dropping condoms, or is that a separate convo I pair with this one?\n- If he wants to be exclusive but “keep the apps to browse,” is that a normal thing some people do, or is that a boundary mismatch?\n\nI really like him and don’t want to torpedo this by coming in hot, but I also don’t want to keep investing if we’re not aligned. Would love concrete scripts and how you’d handle different responses.\n subreddit: dating_advice",
  "title: He texted after 30 days of no contact — do I break NC or keep healing?\n self_text: 29F, ex is 31M. We dated 1.5 years, broke up a month ago after another round of the same argument (I felt low-priority, he felt criticized, we both got defensive and said hurtful things). I started no-contact so I could stop the spiral and actually heal. I blocked him on everything.\n\nLast night he texted from a new number: “Can we talk?”\n\nI’ve been doing okay-ish with NC (therapy, journaling, long walks, deleted photos, focusing on sleep/eating). Still, I get intrusive “what if he finally gets it?” thoughts—especially at night. I’m ADHD and tend to ruminate, so this feels like someone dangling instant relief.\n\nI keep going back and forth:\n- Reasons to keep NC: Patterns don’t change in 30 days, I finally have some peace, and I don’t want to reset the grief clock.\n- Reasons to respond: He might actually want to apologize and be accountable, and part of me wants a calm, adult closure conversation.\n\nIf you’ve been here:\n- Did you ever break NC and feel glad you did? What made it different that time (specific actions, not just words)?\n- If you kept NC when your ex reached out, what helped you ride the urge without caving?\n\nIf I respond, I’m considering a super clear boundary text like: “If the purpose is sincere accountability and a concrete plan for change, I’m open to a single 30-minute call in daylight, no rehashing or future-planning. Otherwise, I need to continue no contact.” Then stick to it: public place or phone only, time-boxed, no alcohol, no overnights, no “one last hug.”\n\nIs that wise, or is it just me bargaining with withdrawal? Would love scripts or guardrails that helped you either (a) do a one-time conversation without getting pulled back in, or (b) protect your NC and sanity when the ping comes in.\n subreddit: r/BreakUps",
  "title: Is it fair to ask my boyfriend to scale back daily contact with his ex? 30F/31M, 6 months in\n self_text: I’ve been dating my boyfriend (31M) for 6 months; we became exclusive 2 months ago. He and his ex (29F) dated for ~4 years and broke up about 8 months before we met. He says it was mutual and they “work better as friends.”\n\nWhat’s hard for me: they’re in touch constantly. I’ve noticed multiple daily texts, regular calls (sometimes late at night), and he’ll run over to help her with stuff (putting together furniture, taking her to the mechanic, etc.). He once stepped away from a date with me to talk her through a “mini crisis” for ~45 minutes. I found out about the frequency from normal phone notifications and things he tells me—no snooping.\n\nWhen I’ve brought it up, he says she’s “like family” and he doesn’t want to “alienate her.” He insists it’s purely platonic and says I’m coming across as jealous. For what it’s worth, I’ve been cheated on before, so I’m trying hard to reality-check myself. I don’t want to control who he’s friends with. At the same time, this level of access feels like she’s still in the “partner” seat emotionally, and it’s hard for me to feel like there’s space for our relationship to deepen.\n\nHe hasn’t introduced me to her yet—he says it’s “not necessary.” I’ve asked to meet so we can normalize it, but he’s dodged that.\n\nI’m considering setting clear boundaries about what I’m comfortable with:\n- No late-night calls with an ex unless it’s a real emergency.\n- No frequent 1:1 hangouts at her place; if they spend time, keep it in public or group settings.\n- Scale down from daily texting to occasional check-ins.\n- Meet each other so I’m not a secret or an outsider to this part of his life.\n- He’s not her primary emotional support person anymore—she can lean on friends/family/therapist.\n\nI’d present it as my boundary (what I will or won’t stay in a relationship for) rather than rules for him. Something like: “I respect that you care about her. I also need our relationship to be the primary place where you invest partner-level time and emotional energy. Are you willing to make adjustments so there’s room for us?”\n\nQuestions:\n- Are these boundaries reasonable for a new exclusive relationship?\n- If you maintain close friendships with exes, what does healthy contact look like in practice?\n- How do I phrase this without it sounding like an ultimatum, while still being clear about my limits?\n- If he refuses to adjust or won’t introduce me, is that my sign that our values aren’t aligned and I should leave?\n\nI really want to approach this thoughtfully and kindly. I’m open to being told I’m off base, but I also don’t want to ignore my gut if I’m seeing a mismatch in what “exclusive” means to each of us.\n subreddit: relationship_advice",
  "title: Friend spotted the guy I’m seeing back on Hinge after we both “deleted” — how do I ask for exclusivity without sounding accusatory?\n self_text: I’m 29F, he’s 31M. We met on Hinge and have been seeing each other ~3 months, 1–2x/week. We’ve done weekends together, met some of each other’s friends, he keeps a toothbrush at my place, and we’ve been intimate. About a month ago he said he deleted the apps and asked if I was still using mine. I said I’d delete too, and I did.\n\nLast night a friend sent me his refreshed Hinge profile (new prompts/photos). When I brought it up calmly today (“Hey, a friend saw you on Hinge—are you still using it?”), he said he re-downloaded to “browse” but isn’t going on dates, and that “labels make things weird” and he wants to “keep it fun and see where it goes.”\n\nI like him and want to be exclusive. I’m not asking for a big title or to move in—just: are we only seeing each other or not? If he’s not there, I don’t want to keep doing sleepovers/sex and turning down other dates while he’s shopping around. I also don’t want to sound accusatory or needy, and I don’t want to turn this into a debate over whether “browsing” counts.\n\nLooking for:\n- A direct but non-confrontational script to ask for exclusivity and set a boundary.\n- What’s a reasonable timeline after 3 months? Is it fair to give a clear choice and step back if it’s a no?\n- If he says he needs “more time,” how do I respond without getting stuck in limbo? Is setting a short timeline (e.g., a week or two) reasonable?\n- Is “exclusive but no label” a meaningful commitment or just semantics?\n\nDraft I’m considering:\n“I like you and I’m interested in being exclusive. If you’re not ready for that, that’s totally okay, but I’m going to take a step back from sleepovers/sex and keep my options open rather than act exclusive when we aren’t. Let me know what you want to do.”\n\nDoes that sound balanced? Any tweaks so it’s clear and calm, not accusatory?

  "title: Is it reasonable to ask my new boyfriend (32M) to stop liking/commenting on his ex’s (31F) thirst traps? I (30F) feel disrespected but don’t want to be controlling.\n self_text: Me: 30F. Him: 32M. Dating 4 months, exclusive for 6 weeks. He and his ex (31F) dated ~5 years and broke up 9 months ago; he says it was mutual and they’re “cool.”\n\nEverything is good otherwise—he’s consistent, kind, and we’re building something that feels promising. What’s tripping me up is his social media behavior with his ex. He still follows her, likes basically all her posts, and recently commented emojis on a bikini pic. He also responded to a Story with a heart. She replies and it reads flirty. I noticed because he was scrolling next to me; I didn’t go snooping. When I brought it up later, he said it’s “just Instagram,” that he likes everyone’s stuff and wants to stay amicable. He doesn’t think it means anything.\n\nI told him that, for me, publicly engaging with an ex in a flirty way feels disrespectful now that we’re exclusive. I didn’t ask him to unfollow her; I asked if he’d be willing to stop liking/commenting on her thirst-trap posts and keep any contact neutral. He said I was being insecure/controlling and he won’t let a partner “police” his socials—but then also said he’d try to be more mindful. A week later, I saw another like on a similar post.\n\nFor context: I have some anxious attachment from a past relationship with infidelity. I’m in therapy and actively working on it. I don’t want to micromanage or check his phone. I do want to honor my own boundaries about what a respectful, exclusive relationship looks like to me.\n\nMy questions:\n1) Is this a reasonable boundary in a new exclusive relationship, or am I making IG a bigger deal than it is?\n2) How would you phrase a clear boundary vs. a controlling rule?\n3) If this is a values mismatch, how do I decide whether to walk away early instead of spiraling?\n\nWhat I’m thinking of saying: “I’m not trying to control who you follow. For me, a partner actively liking/commenting flirty pics of an ex crosses a line. If that’s how you want to use social media, that’s your choice, but we’re probably not compatible. If you’re open to keeping that relationship more neutral, I’m comfortable continuing.” Does that sound fair?\n\nAdditional context: He says he’s not trying to get back together, they don’t hang out one-on-one, and there are no other cheating red flags. But my stomach drops when I see it, and then I either swallow it and resent him or start monitoring—neither of which I want.\n\nWould love outside perspective from people who’ve navigated this.

And if I’m in the wrong, what reframes or coping strategies helped you not take this personally?\n subreddit: relationship_advice",
  "title: 3 months in, great vibe, but he still updates his dating profile. How do I ask for exclusivity without making it an ultimatum?\n self_text: I’m 33F, he’s 35M. We met on Hinge and have been seeing each other about 3 months. We go on one proper date a week (sometimes two), text daily, and have a few long phone calls each week. He’s consistent and thoughtful, plans ahead, remembers details, and has been very respectful of my slower physical pace (we’ve been intimate but haven’t had sex yet; that’s my choice and he’s never pushed).\n\nWe had a convo at around the 6-week mark where I asked what he was looking for. He said “I’m looking for something real, I don’t want to rush labels, and I’m not seeing anyone seriously.” I said I’m dating with intention and I’m not interested in juggling multiple people. We left it there.\n\nWhat’s bothering me: I recently noticed he updated a Hinge prompt (yes, I know, I should not have looked, but I did). When I asked casually whether he still uses the apps, he said he “checks sometimes out of habit” but isn’t “actively looking.” I didn’t push, but it’s been gnawing at me. I don’t want to police anyone, and I get that exclusivity conversations can happen at different paces. But three months in, spending most weekends together, and talking daily… I feel like it’s fair to ask for exclusivity and to pause/deactivate apps if we’re building something.\n\nMy dilemma:\n- I don’t want to come across as controlling or insecure.\n- I want to be clear about my boundary (I don’t want to keep investing if he’s still shopping around).\n- I genuinely like him and would prefer not to spook him with a heavy convo if this can be straightforward.\n- If he’s not ready for exclusivity, I want to bow out gracefully rather than slide into a situationship.\n\nQuestions for folks who’ve handled this well:\n1) Is 3 months a reasonable time to ask for exclusivity if everything else is going well?\n2) Is it fair to pair exclusivity with “let’s pause/delete dating apps,” or is that too prescriptive?\n3) Would you do this in person or via text first (to set context), then talk in person?\n4) Can you help me with a calm, non-ultimatum script?\n\nWhat I’m thinking of saying (please tweak/critique):\n- “I’m really enjoying getting to know you and I’m interested in being exclusive. For me, exclusivity also means pausing dating apps. If you’re not in the same place, that’s totally okay, but I’d need to take a step back from dating each other.”\nOr\n- “I like where this is going and I want to focus on us. Are you open to being exclusive and pausing apps? If not, no hard feelings—I just want to be honest about what I’m looking for.”\n\nDoes that read as a boundary rather than an ultimatum? Any softer or clearer wording you’d suggest? Also, if he says he wants to keep it casual for now, what’s a graceful exit line that doesn’t burn the bridge but protects my time/feelings?\n\nAppreciate any scripts or experiences—especially from people who’ve done this at the 2–4 month mark without it turning into pressure or a standoff.\n subreddit: dating_advice",
  "title: How do I ask for exclusivity without spiraling? 29F with ADHD dating 31M for ~2 months\n self_text: I (29F) have ADHD with the fun combo of RSD and intrusive thoughts. I’ve been seeing a 31M for about 8 weeks. It’s going well on paper: 2–3 dates a week, consistent plans he initiates half the time, met two of his friends, sleepovers, he cooks for me, toothbrush at his place. He’s said he “isn’t a big texter,” but he does follow through on plans. We haven’t had the “what are we” talk.\n\nWhere I’m struggling:\n- Early on he said he was “not a labels person until it feels right.” I said “cool, let’s keep it light and see.” But now we’re acting couple-y and my brain is stuck in ambiguity limbo.\n- I’m not sleeping with anyone else and don’t want to if we’re still seeing each other. I also care about STI safety.\n- My ADHD brain keeps spiraling. I’ve caught myself checking whether his dating app looks active and peeking at his social media follows. Not proud of it. It makes me feel anxious and icky.\n- I don’t want to push him, but I also don’t want to ignore my own needs just to “seem chill.”\n\nWhat I want:\n- Clarity. I’m okay if we’re not doing labels, but I want exclusivity for intimacy (sex/romantic dates). If he’s not ready for exclusivity, that’s his choice, and I’ll step back.\n- A way to ask for this that’s direct, calm, and doesn’t sound accusatory or clingy.\n- Coping ideas so I don’t spiral before/after the talk.\n\nQuestions for you:\n1) Is 8 weeks a reasonable time to ask for exclusivity? What’s normal pacing where you live?\n2) Best way to frame this as a boundary vs a demand? Script ideas welcome.\n3) If he says “not ready,” what’s a healthy response and exit plan that doesn’t turn into a negotiation?\n4) ADHD/RSD folks: how do you manage the urge to reassurance-seek or stalk socials during ambiguity?\n\nDraft scripts I’m considering:\n- “I’m really enjoying what we have and I’m interested in focusing on just you. I don’t need a label, but I am looking for exclusivity for intimacy and STI safety. Is that where you’re at?”\n- “I like you and want to keep building this. I’m at a point where continuing means being exclusive.

I’m not asking for a big label or future promises—just clarity now.”\n\nBoundaries I’m trying to hold with myself:\n- No detective work. If I need to snoop, I need to talk.\n- If answer is “not ready,” I won’t try to convince him. I’ll decide based on my needs.\n- Set a time to have the talk (next in-person date), and a follow-up plan so I’m not ruminating all week.\n\nReality check appreciated: am I being reasonable?

  "title: NYC tenants: bedbugs + mice + unresponsive management — best way to document, 311, and start an HP action?\n self_text: I’m in a rent-stabilized walk-up in Brooklyn (8 units). Since late July we’ve had mice (droppings under the sink, stove insulation shredded, sightings at night) and now bedbugs (confirmed by bites + a live one we caught last week). Management is slow and dismissive. They sent a “guy” twice who threw down sticky traps and did a light spray, but they didn’t seal any gaps or do prep instructions. We keep seeing activity. A neighbor casually mentioned “yeah, it’s been an issue for a while.”\n\nI’d like to handle this by the book and create a paper trail. For folks who’ve been through this in NYC:\n- What’s the best way to document for HPD/housing court? Photos/video, logs of dates/times, bagged specimen? Anything I’m missing?\n- For 311: should I file separate complaints for mice and bedbugs? What does the inspector visit look like? Any tips to make sure they actually see the conditions and issue violations?\n- Landlord obligations: am I correct that they must use integrated pest management (seal entry points, door sweeps, repair leaks, licensed PCO, etc.) and not just toss traps? Is there a specific NYC law/code I should cite in emails?\n- Bedbug history: can I formally request the building’s bedbug history/annual filing or the HPD “bedbug disclosure” for my unit? How do I ask for that in a way that gets a response?\n- HP action timing: if I file an HP action in housing court to force remediation, what’s the usual timeline from filing to first appearance/inspection? Do I need a lawyer for this, or can I DIY?\n- Rent: I’ve read not to withhold rent without counsel. If I pursue an HP action, is there a way to pay rent into the court or seek abatement after repairs? What’s realistic?\n- Retaliation: is there specific NYC/NY State retaliation protection I should reference when I start pushing this harder?\n- Building-wide issues: is there any benefit to coordinating with neighbors for a joint approach? (I’m not trying to start drama, just wondering if it helps HPD or court take it seriously.)\n\nWhat I’ve already done:\n- Dated photos of droppings, holes under sink/around radiator pipes, and the live bedbug in a sealed bag.\n- Emailed management with timestamps and asked for a licensed exterminator + sealing of gaps. They replied “we’ll send someone next week” then no-showed.\n- Logged bite dates and where we found evidence. We’ve laundered/dried everything on high heat and encased mattresses.\n\nNext steps I’m planning unless advised otherwise:\n- Send a concise certified letter + email summarizing issues, requesting licensed PCO and IPM, and asking for bedbug history disclosure.\n- File 311 complaints (one for bedbugs, one for mice) and make sure we’re home for the inspection.\n- If no action after violations, file an HP action.\n\nIf you’ve done this recently, I’d love a step-by-step of what worked, any forms/templates you used for the certified letter, and realistic timelines. Also open to recommendations for tenant clinics or orgs that can guide me (I’ve heard of Housing Court Answers and Legal Aid, but not sure where to start). Thanks!\n subreddit: AskNYC",
  "title: How do I bring up exclusivity + realistic texting expectations without sounding controlling? (31F with ADHD/anxious attachment, 7 weeks in)\n self_text: 31F, dating 33M for ~7 weeks. We’ve had 8 dates, started sleeping over, he’s cooked for me, and I met some of his friends once. He’s consistent about planning dates and is very present in person. Early on he said he’s “not good at multi-dating” and last week said he’s “not seeing anyone else,” but we haven’t explicitly defined exclusivity or talked about apps/STI stuff. I’d like clarity.\n\nContext about me: I have ADHD and some anxious attachment that flares because an ex cheated. I’m working on it in therapy, and I don’t want to make him my reassurance machine. But long gaps + very short texts can send me into overthinking.\n\nHis texting style: He confirms plans, responds when I ask a direct question, but often does 12–24 hour gaps with brief replies. Not much “good morning”/“good night.” When I mentioned I get in my head between dates, he said he’s “not a big texter” but that he is into me and prefers “slow and steady.” In person, he’s affectionate and attentive, so the mismatch is mostly in-between contact.\n\nWhat I want:\n- Exclusivity clarity (including what that means: mutually deleting apps, expectations if one of us isn’t ready).\n- Sexual health clarity (condoms/STI testing if not exclusive).\n- Realistic communication: not constant texting, but some check-ins so I don’t spiral. Ideally a brief daily touchpoint or at least a few “thinking of you/how’s your day?” texts per week, with some initiation from him too.\n\nI’m planning to bring this up calmly at dinner Friday. I want it to feel collaborative, not like a performance review.\n\nQuestions:\n- Is it reasonable at ~7 weeks to ask for exclusivity or a timeline for it? If not exclusive, is it reasonable to ask for condoms + recent STI testing?\n- How reasonable is a daily check-in text ask? If that’s too much, what’s a fair middle ground that respects his “not a big texter” style but also doesn’t leave me spinning?\n- Where’s the line between expressing needs vs sounding controlling? I want to communicate in a way that he can respond honestly (even if the answer is “not ready”).\n- If he says he’s exclusive but keeps his apps “just to browse,” is that a red flag or a conversation about definitions?\n- At what point do we call it a compatibility mismatch vs negotiable compromise?\n\nWould love concrete scripts. Here are a few I’m considering—are these reasonable?\n\nDirect:\n“I’m really enjoying this and want to see where it goes. I’d like to be exclusive. Is that where you’re at? If not, no problem—I’ll keep things casual on my end and use condoms, and we can revisit in a few weeks. If yes, I’d like us to delete apps and schedule STI testing if we haven’t recently.”\n\nCollaborative:\n“I like you and the pace we’re at. I also do best with a bit more clarity. How do you define ‘exclusive,’ and what timeline feels natural to you? For me, exclusivity includes deleting apps and being sexually exclusive. If you’re not there yet, what would help you get there?”\n\nOn texting:\n“I don’t need constant chat, but I do better with a little connective tissue between dates. Would a quick daily or near-daily check-in feel doable for you? Even a ‘thinking of you’ or a meme counts. If daily feels like too much, what cadence feels good to you so we both feel connected?”\n\nBoundaries if not aligned:\n“If you’re not ready for exclusivity, that’s okay. For my own peace of mind, I’d keep using condoms and might keep my apps. If we’re exclusive, I’d like us both to delete them.”\n\nPossible red/green flags I’m unsure about:\n- “I don’t like labels” after ~2 months of consistent dating—normal preference or avoidance?\n- Refusing STI testing or condoms if not exclusive—dealbreaker?\n- “I won’t text more, that’s just how I am”—compatibility issue vs reasonable boundary?\n- Saying exclusive but not wanting to delete apps—expectation mismatch?\n\nAlso open to tips for managing my own stuff (ADHD/anxious spirals) during 12–24 hour gaps—behavioral strategies that don’t rely on him changing overnight.\n\nThanks in advance for reality checks and better wording. I want to be clear, kind, and open to his side while also advocating for my needs.\n subreddit: dating_advice",
  "title: How do I set healthy boundaries around exes and dating apps without sounding controlling?\n self_text: I’m 29F dating a 31M for a little over 3 months. We see each other 2–3x/week, have had two small weekend trips, and have loosely talked about “where this is going” but haven’t explicitly defined exclusivity. He’s sweet, consistent, and generally transparent. I really like him and want to do this right.\n\nMy sticking point: lingering ex/dating-app stuff is making me anxious, and I’m trying to figure out what’s a reasonable boundary vs me overcorrecting from past hurt.\n\nContext:\n- He dated his ex for ~2 years, broke up ~8 months ago. No kids/shared lease. They still follow each other and occasionally like each other’s posts.\n- Last week she texted him “hope you’re well” after seeing a story. He showed me without me asking, responded briefly and politely, then didn’t continue it. He said he’s not interested in reconnecting and that the relationship ran its course.\n- He still has the dating apps on his phone. He says he hasn’t been on dates since we met but also admits he still “mindlessly swipes when bored” and that he was waiting to talk labels before deleting anything.\n- My background: my last serious ex cheated and kept “harmless” chats with exes open. I’m in therapy and doing work around reassurance-seeking. I don’t want to make new guy pay for old guy’s behavior.\n\nWhat I want: to ask for exclusivity and set some clear expectations so I can feel safe, without being controlling. My instinct is to say something like: if we agree to be exclusive, I’d want us both to delete dating apps (accounts, not just the icons), stop following/liking exes’ content for now (or at least mute), and no one-on-one hangs/texting with exes unless there are logistics (mutual friends/events). If an ex reaches out, just keep it neutral and let the other know. I’m okay with them not blocking each other or doing anything dramatic—just minimizing opportunities for slippery-slope situations while we build trust.\n\nQuestions:\n1) Are those boundaries reasonable for 3 months in if we both want exclusivity? What would you tweak to make them fair and not controlling?\n2) How do I bring this up without it sounding like “delete people from your life for me”? I want to frame it as “Here’s what I need to feel secure. If that isn’t a fit, that’s okay, but I want to be honest.”\n3) Is it normal to expect app deletion immediately once you agree on exclusivity? Is giving a day or two grace period reasonable, or is that a red flag?\n4) If he says he’s not ready to delete apps or wants to keep casual contact with his ex “because it’s harmless,” how do I evaluate whether that’s incompatible values vs something we can compromise on? At what point do you walk away vs give it time?\n5) Any scripts you’ve used that strike the right tone? I’m aiming for calm, specific, and non-accusatory, e.g., “I’m really happy with you and I’d like to be exclusive. When I’m exclusive, I delete my apps and keep distance from exes while trust grows. Would that work for you? If not, can we talk about what would help us both feel respected?”\n\nFor what it’s worth, I’m not trying to police social media likes or demand block lists. I also know engagement with exes can be totally benign. But my nervous system gets loud around gray areas, and I’d rather set clear expectations than silently stew or do sneaky phone checks (which I won’t do).\n\nIf you’ve navigated this successfully, what worked? What’s a healthy middle path between “anything goes” and “cut off every ex forever”? Thanks in advance.\n subreddit: relationship_advice",
  "title: UWS rental: months of mice, super only stuffs steel wool. How do I escalate (311/HPD/Housing Court)? What proof should I gather?\n self_text: Hi NYC folks—looking for practical next steps from people who’ve done this.\n\nContext:\n- Upper West Side, pre-war, rent-stabilized 1BR\n- Mice for ~3 months. I’ve caught 6, still seeing droppings nightly.\n- Management’s “fix” is the super stuffing steel wool and caulk in obvious gaps, then disappearing. No licensed exterminator has been scheduled despite multiple requests.\n- I’ve sealed my food in bins, reduced clutter, put door sweeps on, and filled small gaps with copper mesh. Still getting activity, especially around the stove and radiator risers.\n- Neighbors on my line report mice too.\n\nI want to do this the right way and create a record. My goals: get proper IPM (integrated pest management) done building-wide, and if needed, pursue remedies like rent abatement or an HP action. Not trying to be combative—just want a safe, clean apartment.\n\nQuestions:\n1) 311/HPD: For mice, is the correct path to file a 311 complaint so HPD inspects and issues a violation? Anything specific I should say when filing to make sure it’s routed correctly (e.g., “recurring rodent infestation; multiple units affected; landlord not providing licensed exterminator”)? How long does HPD usually take to inspect?\n\n2) Documentation: What exactly should I compile?\n   - Date-stamped photos of droppings, holes/entry points, traps/catches\n   - Video of mouse sightings\n   - Emails/texts to management/super and their replies\n   - Logs of dates/times I’ve reported and work was (or wasn’t) done\n   - Receipts for any supplies/food replaced\nAnything else HPD or Housing Court actually finds persuasive?\n\n3) Repairs vs. abatement: If I open an HP action, that compels repairs, right? If I want rent abatement for breach of warranty of habitability, is that typically pursued as a defense/counterclaim in a nonpayment case or can I bring it affirmatively? Any experiences with how judges view mouse issues?\n\n4) Licensed exterminator: Is it reasonable to demand monthly service with proper bait stations, sealing around risers/gas lines with metal flashing (not just caulk/steel wool), door sweeps for public hallway doors, and chute/garbage room maintenance? If management refuses, is hiring my own licensed exterminator and seeking reimbursement ever successful here?\n\n5) Building-wide issue: If multiple units are affected, is forming a tenant association worth it for leverage? Any UWS tenant groups or resources to help organize? Is a class action realistic for this kind of problem, or overkill?\n\n6) Resources: Recommendations for free/low-cost help? I’ve seen:\n   - Met Council on Housing hotline\n   - Housing Court Answers\n   - Legal Aid / Legal Services NYC / Mobilization for Justice\nAny other clinics or councilmember offices that are responsive about HPD follow-ups?\n\nI’d appreciate scripts/templates for a certified letter to management demanding a licensed exterminator and IPM within a set timeframe. Also any timelines—how long you waited after 311 before filing an HP action—and lessons learned. Thanks!\n subreddit: r/AskNYC",
  "title: NYC: Bedbugs + mice + spotty heat in “luxury” rental — what’s the smartest order (311, HP action, DHCR, rent abatement)?\n self_text: Looking for a clear, NYC-specific game plan from people who’ve actually done this.\n\nContext:\n- Market-rate “luxury” rental, 12-month lease, I’m 9 months in. Multiple floors (not a tiny walk-up). Management company is… performative at best.\n- Issues: confirmed bedbugs (PCO found evidence twice in 6 weeks), recurring mice (droppings and sightings), and inconsistent heat at night. Super keeps telling me to “buy traps” and “wash sheets,” but building-wide problems are obvious (neighbors quietly admit similar issues).\n\nWhat I’ve done:\n- Logged dates/times, photos of bites and droppings, saved bagged samples, kept PCO reports and prep instructions. Emailed management (no phone-only convos), asked for building-wide IPM approach and licensed exterminator visits to adjacent/stacked units.\n- Heat: used a digital thermometer and took timestamped photos. Some nights my apt is 58–60F around 2–4am. During the day it sometimes meets the standard, but nights it doesn’t.\n- Access: I’ve cooperated with all treatments and prep. I’m not obstructing.\n\nWhat I’m trying to decide (order of operations):\n1) 311 first for each category (bedbugs, rodents, heat) to build a paper trail with HPD? If so, do I call every single time it’s below code or just once per issue? Does frequency matter for HP action?\n2) If I go straight to an HP action (Housing Part in Civil Court) to force repairs/extermination/heat compliance, is there any advantage to having a month or two of 311 logs first, or is documentation + current violations enough?\n3) Rent abatement: I know DHCR “decrease in services” is for rent-stabilized (I’m likely not stabilized), so in my case is the realistic path to seek an abatement through Housing Court as part of an HP action or separate proceeding? Should I keep paying full rent to avoid a nonpayment case and pursue abatement after?\n4) Retaliation concerns: If I file 311/HP, how protected am I from retaliatory eviction/lease non-renewal in a market-rate unit? I’ve read about RPL §223-b (retaliation presumption within a year of a good-faith complaint). In practice, how does this play out? Anything I should do now (e.g., only written communication, saving all notices) to make that protection meaningful?\n5) Bedbug specifics: Can I push for building-wide inspection/treatment (stacked/adjacent units) under NYC’s obligation to eradicate pests and maintain a habitable standard? Is there a way to compel integrated pest management rather than one-off “spray and pray”?\n6) Heat: For violations, is it enough to call 311 nightly when it’s under 62F after 10pm, or do I need an inspector to catch it in the act? Any tips on getting HPD to actually come at night or verify early-morning temps?\n7) Lease exit: If the issues persist, what’s the realistic path to early termination based on warranty of habitability/constructive eviction without risking a huge penalty? Is that only advisable if I actually move out first?\n\nIf you’ve been through this in NYC, I’d love:\n- The sequence that worked (e.g., 311 logs → HPD violations → HP action).\n- What you brought to court (photos, 311 complaint numbers, PCO reports, neighbor statements).\n- Whether you coordinated with neighbors for a stronger case.\n- Any orgs you recommend (Met Council on Housing hotline, Housing Court Answers, Legal Aid Society, Legal Services NYC, Mobilization for Justice, etc.) and how you approached them.\n\nTrying to be thorough, cooperative, and realistic. I just don’t want to accidentally make a wrong move (like withholding rent too early) that hurts me later. Thanks!\n subreddit: r/AskNYC",

I paused my apps because I want to focus on him, but I noticed he was active on Hinge yesterday.\n\nI have a little anxious/overthinking streak (working on it in therapy), so ambiguity makes me spiral.

How are you feeling?”\n- “I’m off the apps because I want to see where this goes. What would feel right for you right now—still exploring or being exclusive?”\n- “I want to keep seeing you and stay sexually exclusive. If you’re not there yet, I can respect that, but I’d want to know so I can date accordingly.”\n\nOther questions:\n- Is it better to ask about exclusivity first, then do a “delete the apps” date as a fun follow-up if we agree?\n- Should I tie this to safer sex/STD testing expectations, or keep that a separate convo?\n- What’s a reasonable timeline if he says “not ready yet” (e.g., check back in a few weeks vs. take that as a no)?\n- If he says he wants to keep it casual, how do I bow out kindly without making it awkward?\n\nWould love examples of what worked for you, or red/green flags to watch for in how he responds.\n subreddit: dating_advice",

We met on an app and have been seeing each other for ~7 weeks (8 dates, a couple sleepovers, met his friends twice). We text daily, make weekend plans in advance, and he’s affectionate and consistent. It feels boyfriend-y… except when I raised exclusivity last night, he said he “really likes me” but “isn’t ready for labels” because his last breakup (April) “messed him up.” He also still occasionally texts his ex “to be on good terms.” His dating profile shows “active recently.”\n\nI’m looking for an actual relationship, and at minimum sexual exclusivity for health/emotional clarity. I don’t want to police him, but I also don’t want to be in a situationship where I’m investing and he’s keeping his options open. I can feel my anxiety spiking and I don’t want to act out of fear or be controlling.\n\nWhat I’m thinking of saying:\n“I really like what we have and want to keep getting to know each other. For me, that means dating each other exclusively (not seeing/sleeping with other people and deleting the apps). If you’re not there yet, that’s okay, but I don’t continue being intimate non-exclusively. Take a couple weeks to think about it and let me know. If it’s a no or a ‘not sure,’ I’ll step back so we’re both aligned.”\n\nQuestions:\n- Is giving two weeks for an answer reasonable at ~2 months in, or is that an ultimatum?\n- Is it fair to ask that he stop casual/texty contact with his ex if we become exclusive? (I’m not trying to ban cordial logistics if they share mutual friends, but the “we still chat” part gives me knots.)\n- Should I pause sex now until this is clear, or is that overkill?\n- If someone says they’re “not ready for labels,” is that usually a soft no?

I want to leave room for a yes, but also be ready to walk if we’re mismatched.\n\nI’m okay with him not being my person; I just want to handle this calmly and respectfully, and not get stuck in a gray area that hurts later.

If life happens, we at least send a “goodnight, talk soon” text.\n- 2–3 scheduled calls per week with agreed start/end times (e.g., Tue/Thu 30 min, Sun 60 min). Timer or calendar invite so it starts/ends predictably.\n- One weekly “state of us” 10–15 min where we ask, “What went well, what was hard, any tweaks?” to adjust before resentment builds.\n- Shared calendar for calls, visits, and “quiet hours.” Using Focus/Do Not Disturb so the green dot doesn’t create pressure to respond.\n- “Missed connection” plan: If someone forgets a check-in/call, the other sends a neutral “Hey, reschedule for tomorrow?” instead of “Are you mad?” No blame if it’s rescheduled within 24 hours.\n- Reassurance script for me when anxious: “Hey, I’m feeling a wobble. Can you send a quick ‘we’re good’ when you can?” And for him when overloaded: “My bandwidth is low today but we’re good; I’ll call you tomorrow.”\n- A “maintenance mode” plan for busy seasons: default to every-other-day touchpoints and 1 weekly call, then ramp back up after.\n- Visual anchors: a photo album or shared note of small moments to feel connected when we can’t talk.\n\nQuestions for folks who’ve done LDR, especially with ADHD in the mix:\n- What’s a realistic cadence for daily/weekly contact that doesn’t burn people out?\n- Any scripts that reduce anxiety without sounding accusatory?\n- How do you prevent the ADHD partner from feeling managed while still building reliability?\n- What tools/automation actually help (shared reminders, recurring events, widgets, voice memos)?\n- How do you tell the difference between normal rhythm shifts vs. “interest is fading,” and what’s your early check-in cue?\n- If you tried daily check-ins, did it become pressure?

I’m thinking something like: “I’m really into you and would like to focus on us. Exclusive/off-apps sounds good to me, and I’d love a check-in in a month to see how we’re feeling about labels.

I also want to be upfront that I’ve had trust hurt in the past, so I appreciate direct communication if anything changes for you.”\n\nDoes that sound reasonable/attractive, or too cautious? Any green/red flags I should watch for in how he responds? If he says “labels or nothing,” is that my sign to slow down or step back?\n subreddit: dating_advice",
  "title: 90 days no contact, ex texted “I miss you”—how do I protect my progress if I reply?\n self_text: 32F, ex is 34M. Together 3 years. We didn’t break up over one event—more like slow erosion from trust issues: “just friends” flirty DMs, hiding notifications, minimizing my feelings, and refusal to set clear boundaries with women who were obviously into him. No confirmed cheating, but lots of gray-area stuff that left me constantly anxious.\n\nI went no-contact 90 days ago. Blocked socials, stopped mutual check-ins, returned his things. I’ve been in therapy, journaling, doing actual weekends alone without panic, and practicing saying no to things that feel bad in my body. I can finally sleep.\n\nLast night he emailed from a new address: “I miss you. Can we talk?”\n\nI’m torn. Part of me wants to hear a real apology and see concrete change. Another part of me is terrified of reopening the wound and losing the progress I clawed my way to.\n\nIf you’ve been here and chose to respond (or not), what helped you decide? I’m not asking for a verdict so much as guardrails so I don’t spin out.\n\nWhat I’m considering:\n- Waiting 72 hours before doing anything, so I’m not reacting from adrenaline.\n- If I reply, setting one-time call rules: no nostalgia, no rehashing the entire relationship, just clarity about what’s different now and why.\n- Asking for specific accountability (e.g., “What boundaries with others will you uphold that you didn’t before?” “What concrete behaviors have changed and for how long?” “What did you learn about minimizing and defensiveness?”).\n- Looking for green flags: he’s already in individual therapy, names his patterns without blaming me, offers specifics instead of “I miss us.”\n- Scripts to keep it contained, like:\n  - “I’m open to one 30-minute call next week to discuss whether change has happened. If not, I’m going to maintain no contact.”\n  - “I’m not in a place to reconnect. I wish you well and will keep no contact.”\n- Or…simply maintaining NC because peace > curiosity.\n\nAlso, practical: we still have one lingering shared login (I forgot about an old Spotify family plan). If I stay NC, should I just transfer it on my end and email a one-line “Account transferred” and re-block, or is that breaking NC in a way that invites more?\n\nMostly I want to protect my progress and not confuse loneliness with readiness. Any decision frameworks, scripts, or “I did X and here’s how it went” would be appreciated.\n subreddit: BreakUps",
  "title: We agreed to be exclusive—he’s still “active today” on Hinge. How do I set a clear boundary without making it a power struggle?\n self_text: 29F with 31M, dating ~3 months. Six weeks ago we had a very explicit exclusivity talk: no dates with other people, no chatting/flirting, and we both said we’d delete our dating apps. We’ve been spending 3–4 nights/week together, met a couple of each other’s friends, and generally it’s been really good.\n\nYesterday my friend sent me his Hinge profile showing “active today,” and I noticed one of his prompts looks newly updated (I’m 99% sure it wasn’t there last week). I asked him about it calmly and he said:\n- He “hasn’t gone on dates or messaged anyone,”\n- He “forgot to delete it” and keeps it out of habit,\n- He gets “nervous about jinxing things” by deleting, and\n- He likes “looking back at how we matched” (which… we actually met IRL, so that confused me).\n\nFor context: I was cheated on in my last relationship and I’m doing a lot of work on not acting from anxiety. I don’t want to police someone’s phone. But to me, exclusivity includes deleting/pausing profiles and not being “active today” on a dating app.\n\nI’m looking for help with:\n- What’s a reasonable boundary here? Is “exclusivity = delete/disable profiles” too strict, or standard?\n- Is it fair to set a clear deadline (e.g., “Please delete/disable by Friday if we’re exclusive”)?\n- If he refuses or dodges, is that a soft boundary (we go back to non-exclusive) or a dealbreaker (we end it)?\n- Script ideas that are direct but not hostile.\n\nDraft script I’m considering:\n“I’m really enjoying us and want to keep building. For me, exclusivity means neither of us is on dating apps or chatting with matches. Seeing your profile ‘active today’ doesn’t work for me. Are you willing to delete or fully disable your profiles by Friday? If not, we’re not aligned on exclusivity and I’ll need to step back.”\n\nIf he says he’ll delete, great—how do I manage the leftover anxiety without slipping into checking? If he argues that deleting is “controlling,” is that a sign we’re mismatched?\n\nWould love perspectives on what’s standard, how firm to be, and any better wording.

  "title: We’re “exclusive,” but he still engages with his ex to “be nice.” Reasonable boundary or controlling?\n self_text: I’m F28, he’s M30. Together 6 months, defined exclusivity 3 months ago. He broke up with his ex ~8 months before we met. They don’t share kids, pets, or finances.\n\nThe issue: his ex texts late at night (memes, “miss us,” reminiscing). He answers politely, sometimes with banter, and has met her for coffee twice “for closure” (he told me after the fact). He says he’s not interested in her, doesn’t want to be “mean,” and offers phone transparency. I appreciate the reassurance, but the pattern makes me feel sidelined and anxious—especially the late-night tone and the secret coffees.\n\nI’m not trying to police his phone or friendships, but I believe “exclusive” should mean not maintaining an emotionally open door with someone who still wants him back. If it were co-parenting or logistics, different story. Here, it feels like people-pleasing at the expense of our relationship.\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n- Shared my feelings calmly and asked if he’d be willing to set a firm boundary (no one-on-one meetups, no late-night texts, and stop engaging with flirty/nostalgic messages).\n- Suggested a clear, kind script to close the loop.\n- He says blocking or a “no contact” message is too harsh and he doesn’t want to be rude.\n\nQuestions for you all:\n- Is it reasonable to ask for no contact (beyond emergencies) with an ex who’s still pursuing, when there are no shared obligations?\n- If that’s fair, what’s a concise script he can send that isn’t cruel but is firm?\n- If he refuses, is this an incompatibility I should take seriously or something I should learn to tolerate?\n\nPossible scripts I’m considering:\n- “Hey, I’m in a committed relationship and want to be respectful of it. I won’t be meeting or texting anymore. I wish you well.”\n- “I’m going to mute our thread to focus on my relationship. Please don’t contact me unless it’s urgent. Take care.”\n\nI’m open to being told I’m off-base; I just want to set healthy, non-controlling boundaries and not keep having the same argument. How would you handle this?\n\nTL;DR: Ex texts late at night and he engages “to be nice,” plus two coffee meetups. I want a firm boundary; he thinks that’s too harsh.

  "title: NYC tenant dealing with bedbugs + mice: what are my next steps (311, HP action, rent abatement)?\n self_text: Brooklyn (Crown Heights), prewar walk-up, not a new tenant. Since late June we’ve had recurring bedbugs and an ongoing mice issue. Management has done the bare minimum (a handyman with a spray bottle at first, then finally a licensed exterminator who’s done 3 treatments so far), but adjacent units haven’t all been treated, prep expectations are unrealistic, and the mice keep returning through gaps in baseboards and under the sink.\n\nWhat I’ve done so far:\n- Logged multiple 311 complaints (some resulted in HPD inspections; mice violation was issued, bedbugs not yet confirmed during inspection time).\n- Photos/videos of live bedbugs, cast skins, fecal spots, bites; date-stamped. Sticky traps with mice caught, droppings, entry points documented.\n- Saved all exterminator notices, prep instructions, laundry receipts, emails/texts with management.\n- Installed mattress/boxspring encasements and interceptors; sealed some gaps with steel wool/caulk on my own.\n\nComplications:\n- Management is pressuring me to stop calling 311 and said they “won’t renew” if I keep making it a “big deal.” I believe retaliation for good-faith complaints is illegal in NYS, but I’m not sure how to protect myself.\n- I have ADHD and the prep is overwhelming. I can do it, but I need more time/support than the 24–48 hrs notice they give, and it’s costing a lot to bag/launder everything repeatedly.\n- I’m current on rent and want to handle this correctly, not make a wrong move.\n\nQuestions for folks who’ve been through this in NYC:\n1) Best way to prep for Housing Court/HP Action: What exactly should I bring, and how long do these typically take? Do I need a lawyer for an HP action or is pro se realistic for this kind of habitability issue?\n2) Rent withholding vs. rent abatement: Is it safer to keep paying and seek an abatement through Housing Court, or file a DHCR “reduction in services” (I’m rent-stabilized) for bedbugs/mice? Anyone have timelines/results for DHCR vs Housing Court?\n3) Breaking the lease vs fixing the problem: If this keeps recurring, is there a lawful path to early termination without penalty for persistent infestation (warranty of habitability), or is the smarter play to push for proper building-wide treatment and abatements?\n4) Retaliation protections: If a landlord hints at non-renewal because I called 311, what should I do right away to document and assert my rights? Is there a specific statute or process I should cite (I’ve seen RPL 223-b mentioned)?\n5) Reasonable accommodations: Can I request accommodation under NYC Human Rights Law/Fair Housing Act for the prep burden (e.g., more notice, scheduling that works with ADHD, help with bagging/laundry or reimbursement)? How do I phrase and deliver that request so it’s on record?\n6) Insurance: Has anyone actually gotten renters insurance to cover laundry, prep supplies, or temporary lodging during heat/chemical treatments? Mine seems to exclude pests, but I’m curious if any NYC policies help with the incidental costs.\n7) Coordination with neighbors: Is it worth knocking doors to encourage reporting so HPD treats this as a building issue, or should I avoid that and stick to formal channels?\n\nAny practical scripts, filing tips, or checklists appreciated (what to say to 311, what to bring to court, how to label evidence, how to avoid procedural mistakes). Also open to recommendations for NYC tenant clinics or nonprofits that can guide me through HP/DHCR steps. Thank you!\n subreddit: AskNYC",
  "title: How do I set fair boundaries around my boyfriend’s “just friends” ex without making it a jealousy ultimatum?\n self_text: 29F dating 31M for 8 months (exclusive for 3). His ex/situationship (28F) was on-and-off for years; they ended a year before we met but still share a tight friend group. She texts late-night memes, invites him to concerts, and they occasionally do one-on-one coffee. I’ve met her twice and she was flirty (inside jokes, called him “my favorite person”). He says it’s harmless and is willing to show me messages, but I don’t want to be in a phone-check dynamic. I’ve been cheated on before and I’m in therapy for trust/jealousy, so I’m trying to separate my triggers from real boundary issues. I proposed: no one-on-one hangs with someone he has history with, keep interactions in group settings, no late-night texting, mute her DMs/IG reactions, and be proactive about including me in group plans so I’m not blindsided. He agreed to group settings and fewer late-night texts but says banning one-on-one is “policing” and that she’ll be at trips/weddings regardless. I don’t want to control him or isolate him from his friends, but I also want to feel secure and not lose sleep over this. Are these boundaries reasonable, and how do I frame them as my needs rather than commands? If he doesn’t agree, is it fair to treat that as a compatibility issue and leave? Looking for practical scripts (“I’m not comfortable with one-on-one hangs with someone you have history with; to feel safe, I need us to keep it group-only. If that doesn’t work for you, I respect it but we aren’t compatible”), ways to set a timeline/check-in (e.g., 30 days), and signs to watch for (red flags: secrecy, defensiveness, triangulation; green flags: proactive updates, invites me, reduces contact without resentment). Also any tips to manage my own side (reducing reassurance-seeking, delaying urge to check socials, CBT/ERP style urges labeling). Would love to hear from people who stayed friends with an ex and made their current partner feel safe—what worked? If the consensus is “this is a values mismatch,” I’m prepared to walk rather than resent each other down the line. Thanks.\n subreddit: r/relationship_advice",
  "title: Rent-stabilized BK apt: bedbugs + mice, landlord stalling. 311 first, or straight to Housing Court HP action? What to document?\n self_text: Rent-stabilized 2BR in a 6-unit walk-up in Brooklyn. In the last month we’ve had both bedbugs and mice. LL sent super with glue traps and a can of spray, then “scheduled” a licensed exterminator who canceled and never got rebooked. They’re refusing to inspect/treat adjacent units even though we share walls/floors. We’re two adults + a toddler + a cat, and we’ve been camping in the living room trying to keep the kid away from bites.\n\nWhat we’ve done so far:\n- Caught a bedbug (taped and saved), took date-stamped photos of bites, droppings, live mouse, and harborages.\n- Bagged and high-heat laundered clothes/linens; mattress/box spring encasements; reduced clutter.\n- Stuffed obvious gaps with copper mesh/steel wool; sealed some cracks with caulk (non-structural).\n- Communicated only by email/text for a paper trail; asked for a licensed PCO and building-wide inspection. LL replies are vague/non-committal.\n\nQuestions for NYC folks who’ve been through this:\n- 311/HPD process: Better to submit separate complaints for bedbugs and mice, or one? How fast does HPD typically inspect, and do they call first? Anything specific to say or avoid when describing the conditions?\n- Documentation: Besides photos/videos and the captured bug, what else helps? Logs of bites/sightings, dated requests for access, witness statements from neighbors?\n- Legal route: Should we file an HP action in Housing Court now or wait for HPD to issue violations? What relief can we actually ask for (licensed PCO, inspecting/treating adjacent units, sealing entry points/repairs, timeline for multiple treatments, access orders, rent abatement, temporary relocation)?\n- Withholding rent: Is it smarter to keep paying while we file, or has anyone successfully negotiated/secured abatements without risking nonpayment proceedings?\n- Treatment specifics: Does NYC require integrated pest management (not just spraying), and inspections/treatments of adjacent units for bedbugs? How many follow-ups are typical and at what intervals?\n- Safety: Tips for doing this with a toddler and a cat? What should we ask the PCO about prep and re-entry times?\n- Insurance/expenses: Has renters insurance or landlord ever covered hotel stays, laundry costs, encasements, or replacing infested items?\n- Organizing: If multiple units have issues, best way to coordinate with neighbors (flyers, group chat) without getting into trouble? Any tenant orgs you recommend in Brooklyn who can guide us?\n\nIf you’ve successfully pushed a landlord to comply (or gone the HP route), what worked, what didn’t, and how long did it take? Scripts/templates for notice to cure, access letters, or HP petitions would be amazing. Thanks!\n subreddit: AskNYC",
  "title: We agreed to be exclusive but he still has dating apps and late-night chats with his ex—reasonable boundary or time to walk?\n self_text: I’m 28F, he’s 30M. We’ve been dating 5 months. About 6 weeks ago we had a clear conversation about being exclusive. He said he was on the same page and would delete his dating apps.\n\nSince then:\n- I saw Hinge notifications pop up on his phone twice (he said he “forgot to delete” and then later said he just “scrolls for funny prompts”).\n- A friend of mine actually came across his profile last week and he’d updated a prompt recently.\n- He frequently DMs his ex (dated 3 years, broke up 2 years ago; they had a one-time “closure hookup” 9 months before I met him). The messages I happened to see were memes and inside jokes around 12:30 a.m. He says they’re “just friends.”\n- He’s planning to go to her birthday next month. I only learned about it because I saw the DM; he hadn’t mentioned it.\n- He likes her IG thirst-trappy posts and reacts to her stories (and other women’s too). He says “it’s just social media.”\n\nOtherwise, he’s consistent: we see each other 2–3x/week, I’ve met some friends, he’s affectionate, I have a drawer at his place. I like him a lot, but my stomach is in knots because what we agreed to isn’t lining up with what he’s doing.\n\nI’m trying to figure out what’s a reasonable boundary here versus me being controlling. To me, exclusivity includes:\n- No active dating profiles (deleted, not just “not using”).\n- No late-night one-on-one chats with an ex or private hangouts that feel like emotional overlap.\n- If you’re going to an ex’s party, bring it up proactively so we can talk about comfort levels.\n\nHere’s the script I’m considering: “Exclusivity to me means you don’t have active dating apps and you’re not having late-night chats with an ex. I’m not asking you to cut off normal, polite contact or group events, but I need a relationship where I feel secure. If this isn’t something you want, that’s okay, but I’ll need to step back rather than stay in a situation that doesn’t match what I’m looking for.”\n\nQuestions:\n- Are these boundaries reasonable?\n- Is asking for no dating apps and no late-night one-on-one ex chats fair, or should I narrow it to something like ‘no private messages after 10 p.m./no one-on-one meetups’?\n- How would you phrase this conversation so it’s clear but not accusatory?\n- If he pushes back (“you’re overthinking” / “it’s just memes”), is that my answer and time to end it?\n\nI want to handle this like an adult without trying to control him.

I didn’t snoop and I didn’t say anything in the moment. I don’t know if his profile is still active or if it was some leftover match/like, but it threw me. He also occasionally likes thirst-trappy posts on IG, which I’ve tried to ignore, but together it’s poking at my trust.\n\nContext: My last partner cheated using apps, so I know I’m sensitive here. I’m in therapy and trying not to project, but I also need our definitions of “exclusive” to match. For me, exclusivity includes not having active dating profiles and not cultivating new romantic options.\n\nIs it reasonable to ask that he delete/disable his dating apps or at least pause his profile?

For me, that includes pausing/deleting dating apps. Is that something you’re comfortable with? If you’re not there yet, that’s okay, but I’m looking for alignment on this.”\n\nDoes that sound fair?

I miss you” from “Aiden 😑.” She said it’s her ex (3-year relationship, broke up ~9 months ago), that he’s “going through stuff,” and she occasionally responds “to be kind.” She didn’t reply in front of me. Next morning she says she texted him “Please stop texting me at night.”\n\nI have a cheating history in my past (I’m in therapy, not looking to control anyone, just naming my triggers). I took a day and asked if she’d be open to a boundary while we’re dating: no late-night texting with exes, no private chats that would feel sketchy if the other person saw them, tell exes we’re seeing someone and keep it daytime/transparent, no one-on-one hangouts with exes. I said I’m not accusing her of anything; I just want a baseline that makes me feel safe if we keep moving forward.\n\nShe said that feels controlling and she doesn’t want to be “policed.” She says she’s not into him and wouldn’t cheat, and suggested we “keep it casual if labels are stressing me.”\n\nI actually want clarity and exclusivity, not endless casual. I don’t think the boundary is wild if we’re moving toward exclusive, but maybe I jumped the gun by bringing it up before we defined things.\n\nQuestions:\n- Is that boundary reasonable once you’re exclusive, and is it premature now?\n- How do I frame this without sounding controlling? Any script suggestions?\n- Is it fair to say, “I like you, but I need exclusivity and clear ex-boundaries to keep dating,” and walk if that’s not aligned?\n\nI’m open to reality checks if I’m overreacting, but I also don’t want to ignore my needs.

  "title: How do I ask for exclusivity before sex without scaring people off?\n self_text: 30F here, back on the apps after a messy breakup where lines were blurry (think “we’re not official but act like it” until I found out they were sleeping with others). I don’t want to repeat that. I’m not looking to rush a relationship, but I do want clarity and STI safety. Ideally: if we’re going to be physically intimate, we’ve both agreed we’re not sleeping with other people.\n\nEvery time I try to bring this up around date 3–4, I feel like I either:\n- wait too long and it’s awkward/feels reactive, or\n- bring it up too early and it freaks them out.\n\nWhen I’ve said it clumsily (e.g., “I only have sex when it’s exclusive”), I’ve had people either vanish or say “Let’s just see where it goes” while trying to push for sex anyway. I’m fine with slow-burn exclusivity; I just want the sequence to be: connect → talk about exclusivity/expectations → sex. Not vibes → sex → “we’ll see.”\n\nI have ADHD and tend to word-vomit or over-explain when I’m anxious, so I’d love specific scripting and timing tips:\n- When in the dating timeline would you bring this up—before a makeout sesh, when planning the next date, or over text between dates?\n- What’s a concise, non-shaming way to say it that signals interest instead of an ultimatum?\n- What are green/amber/red-flag responses? (e.g., “happy to be exclusive,” “let’s revisit in a couple weeks,” “labels are cringe,” etc.)\n- If someone says “I’m not ready for exclusivity yet,” how do I bow out kindly without burning bridges?\n- Is it reasonable to combine this with an STI conversation and testing, or is that too much at once?\n\nDraft script I’m considering: “I’m really enjoying this and I’m attracted to you. Before we keep escalating physically, I do exclusivity and recent STI testing for safety and peace of mind. If you’re not there yet, no pressure—we can keep it light or check back later, but I don’t do sex without that clarity.”\n\nWould that read as calm and adult, or too heavy? Any tweaks or alternatives that have worked for you? Also curious how people handle “soft exclusivity” (not sleeping with others but still feeling things out) vs full-on boyfriend/girlfriend.\n\nThanks in advance—I want to stay kind, clear, and avoid the gray-area heartbreak this time.\n subreddit: dating_advice",
  "title: We said “exclusive” but he’s still on dating apps “out of habit” — is this a dealbreaker or a boundary convo?\n self_text: F29, M31, dating 3.5 months. We had the exclusivity talk ~5 weeks ago. We both said we weren’t seeing other people and I assumed that meant deleting or at least pausing dating apps. I deleted mine that night.\n\nThis weekend a friend sent me screenshots of his Bumble profile with “recently active.” His Hinge also shows new photos he didn’t have when we met. When I asked him about it, he said he occasionally “scrolls out of habit” when he’s bored, but he’s “not matching or chatting,” and that “exclusive = not going on dates,” not necessarily deleting apps. He also said he planned to remove them “eventually.”\n\nI have some baggage here (past partner cheated), so I’m trying to gut-check myself. On one hand, I don’t want to police someone’s phone. On the other hand, being “exclusive” while keeping active profiles feels like hedging. I don’t want to be in a situation where I’m investing while he’s keeping a backup plan warm.\n\nI want to have one clear, adult conversation and either fix the mismatch or exit. What’s a reasonable boundary and how do I phrase it without turning it into a fight? Is asking to delete/fully deactivate (not just “snooze”) fair? If he says no, is that my answer?\n\nDraft script I’m considering:\n- “When we agreed to be exclusive, I assumed we’d be off the apps. I’m not comfortable being exclusive with someone who still uses them, even ‘out of habit.’ I want a partner who deletes their accounts once we commit. Are you willing to delete them this week? If not, we’re not aligned and I’ll step back.”\n\nIs that too harsh? Should I offer a middle ground like ‘pause’ first or is that just prolonging anxiety? Also, how do I handle it if he agrees but I still feel shaky—any tips for rebuilding trust without sliding into surveillance?\n\nWould appreciate perspectives from people who navigated this successfully (or signs it was time to walk). I like him a lot and don’t want to overreact, but I also don’t want to ignore a clear incompatibility around boundaries/commitment.\n subreddit: relationship_advice",
  "title: NYC tenant dealing with bedbugs AND mice, landlord slow-walking it. What are my next steps (311, HPD, Housing Court, rent abatement/break lease)?\n self_text: I’m in a market-rate walk-up in Queens, mid-size building. Lease runs through July 2026. Three weeks ago I woke up with clusters of bites, caught a live bedbug in a tape trap, and emailed the landlord/super with photos. Since then:\n\n- Exterminator came once, did a quick spray of baseboards and told me to “wash everything hot.” They did not treat adjacent units (at least not that I was told), no follow-up scheduled initially.\n- I’m still seeing evidence (cast skins, a nymph on a bed skirt last night). I’ve bagged a few specimens with dates.\n- On top of that, I found fresh mouse droppings under the sink and actually saw a mouse run behind the stove two nights ago. Maintenance stuffed a steel-wool patch in one hole but there are other gaps around pipes that weren’t sealed.\n- LL’s office tried to bill me $300 as a “prep fee” for a second bedbug treatment, which I pushed back on. They backed off for now but are dragging their feet on scheduling comprehensive treatment.\n- I have photos, time-stamped video, a bite log, and a clinic note from urgent care saying probable bedbug bites.\n\nI’ve read a bunch but I’m overwhelmed and want NYC-specific next steps. Questions:\n\n- 311: Do I call 311 for both bedbugs and mice to get HPD/Health Dept inspections on record? Does that create a violation automatically if they confirm? Roughly how long do inspections take after the 311 call?\n- Agencies: For bedbugs/mice, is it HPD or DOHMH or both? If they cite violations, does that help me in Housing Court later for an HP action or rent abatement?\n- Housing Court (HP action): If I file an HP action to force proper extermination and sealing, what evidence do I need day one? Is a 311 complaint required before filing?\n- Withholding/escrow: Is anyone here familiar with the practical risks in NYC of withholding rent or paying into court escrow over vermin issues? I’d prefer not to withhold if there’s a better path, but curious what actually happens in NYC.\n- Rent abatement: If this drags on and I keep getting bites/seeing live bugs, what’s realistic in terms of abatement? Do people negotiate this informally once violations are issued, or is it usually a court determination?\n- Breaking lease: If the building won’t get this under control, is early termination realistic under the warranty of habitability? Has anyone successfully broken a NYC lease over an ongoing bedbug infestation? What documentation was crucial?\n- Treatment scope: Should I insist they treat the units above/below/adjacent and common areas? Can I request written treatment plans and pesticide labels? Do I have a right to 24–48 hr written notice before entry/treatment?\n- Documentation: Beyond photos and a bite log, should I save dead/live specimens in zip bags, keep all laundry/receipt proof, and send everything to the LL via email + certified mail?\n- My own steps: I’ve put on mattress/box spring encasements and installed interceptors. Is that okay while preserving evidence for inspectors/court? Anything else I should do that doesn’t mess up an official inspection?\n- Neighbors: Should I discreetly notify adjacent neighbors or is that the landlord’s legal responsibility? I’ve heard there’s an annual bedbug history disclosure—can I request the building’s report?\n\nAny NYC tenants who’ve gone through this (or folks familiar with HPD/Housing Court timelines), I’d really appreciate a step-by-step order of operations. I’m trying to avoid rookie mistakes (like withholding rent too early) while building a solid record. Thank you.\n subreddit: r/AskNYC",

We see each other 2–3x/week, sleepovers, cooking together, met a couple of his friends. It feels intentional, but he introduced me by my name (not “girlfriend”), and a friend saw him active on Hinge last week. I’m not trying to police anyone’s phone, but before I get more invested I want clarity. I prefer exclusive dating once feelings are involved, and I don’t want to nag or snoop.\n\nIs it reasonable to bring up exclusivity at 3 months? If so, can you help me with wording that’s calm and not accusatory? I want to keep it about my needs, not “gotcha” about app activity.\n\nWhat I’m thinking:\n- “I’ve really enjoyed getting to know you and I’m at a point where I’d like to date exclusively. For me, that means we’re not seeing other people and we both pause/delete the apps. How does that land for you?”\n- “If you’re not in that place, that’s okay—just let me know so I can date accordingly. I don’t want a vague ‘let’s see.’”\n- If he deflects: “It sounds like you’re not ready. I’m going to keep things casual on my end too, and I’ll pull back a bit so expectations match.”\n\nIs it better to avoid mentioning the app thing and keep it needs-based? Also, is it fair to pair exclusivity with an STI test/clean panel before going unprotected if we keep moving forward?\n\nAny timing tips (before/after a date, in person vs. call), and what’s a respectful boundary if he wants to keep things open (e.g., I scale back sleepovers/intimacy/time)?

  "title: NYC tenants: Bedbugs + mice for months, management ignoring — how do I build a solid paper trail for 311/Housing Court and loop in neighbors?\n self_text: Queens, pre-war walk-up, market-rate. Since late May we’ve had mice (droppings, one caught on a trap, video of one running under the stove). In July I started getting lines of bites; in early August I found a couple of tiny bugs and black specks along the mattress seam. A tech came once (looked unlicensed, no company name on any paperwork) and did a quick spray, no building-wide inspection, no prep instructions, no follow-up. Super just sets glue traps and says “this is normal for old buildings.” I’ve emailed management multiple times with photos and dates; they reply “we’ll send someone” and then nothing for weeks.\n\nI want to do this by the book so we can actually get treatment that works. Specific questions for NYC folks who’ve been through this:\n\n- 311: Do I file separate complaints for mice and bedbugs, and is there certain wording that helps trigger an HPD inspection (e.g., “owner failed to provide extermination and to seal entry points,” “ongoing infestation despite notice”)? Any tips on timing or what to expect from the inspector visit?\n- Evidence: I’m keeping date-stamped photos of droppings, gnaw marks, mouse video, bedbug fecal spots, and a bagged sample. Is there anything else inspectors/judges look for (exterminator invoices, neighbor statements, logs of bites), or anything that’s not worth including?\n- Housing Court: For an HP action (to compel repairs), what should I bring and how fast do orders usually happen? If we also want a rent abatement, is that part of the HP case, a counterclaim later, or (if stabilized) via DHCR for reduced services?\n- Bedbug disclosure: Where do I check if the owner filed the annual bedbug report with HPD, and does failure to file matter in practice? Should I request the building-wide inspection history in writing?\n- Organizing: We know at least three other units with the same issues. Is it better to file individual 311 complaints and then a joint HP action, or have everyone file separately? Anything to know about a 7A or tenant association for conditions like this?\n- Retaliation: If we start filing and organizing, what protections apply if they try not to renew or jack up rent? Our lease runs through March.\n\nAnything I’m missing to build a clean paper trail (certified mail to the managing agent, requesting a licensed PCO’s written report, asking for integrated pest management/sealing, etc.)? I’m not trying to be litigious for sport — I just want actual treatment that includes sealing entry points and a coordinated, building-wide plan.

How do you set boundaries and systems without burning bridges?\n self_text: I just started my first full-time office job (hybrid, 3 days in). I’m late-diagnosed ADHD and feeling overwhelmed by the combo of time blindness, constant context switching, and unspoken social rules. I want to do well without masking myself into burnout. Looking for concrete scripts and systems that work specifically in office culture.\n\nWhat’s going on:\n- Meetings are stacked back-to-back with no buffer. I leave with 8 action items, remember 3, and drop the rest.\n- Time blindness makes “EOD” promises dangerous. I’m scared of overcommitting but also terrified of seeming lazy.\n- Slack pings and “quick questions?” yank me out of focus. If I don’t answer fast, I forget entirely.\n- Small talk and “low-effort replies” drain me. I either overshare or go cold, then spiral about being “weird.”\n- I’m masking hard and crashing at home. I don’t want to start with an unsustainable persona.\n- I don’t know when/how to ask for accommodations (informally with my manager vs formally through HR), or what to even ask for.\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n- Time-blocking my calendar (gets bulldozed by invites).\n- Pomodoros (works until I get pinged).\n- Post-meeting checklists (forget to use them).\n- Writing tasks in one “capture” notebook (helps, but I still miss deadlines without reminders).\n- Setting alarms (I snooze them into oblivion when in a meeting).\n\nWhat I’m looking for (scripts and systems welcome):\n- Meeting boundaries\n  - Polite ways to ask for buffers or decline a meeting: “Can we make this 25 mins?” “Could we async this?”\n  - A one-liner to request an agenda or pre-reads so I can prepare and not derail.\n  - How to get post-meeting action items documented without sounding needy.\n\n- Time and task management\n  - A realistic EOD script: “EOD is tight for me—can I get this to you by 10am tomorrow? Here’s what I can deliver today.”\n  - A framework that captures tasks from chat/meetings instantly and assigns deadlines (apps or paper systems that actually stick).\n  - How to prioritize when everything is “urgent.” Any ADHD-friendly triage rules?\n\n- Slack/email survival\n  - Auto-reply or status ideas that buy me focus time without sounding avoidant.\n  - Templates for acknowledging without committing: “Got it—logging this. I’ll circle back by X.”\n  - Rules/filters that reduce noise but don’t make me miss critical messages.\n\n- Social/communication\n  - “Low-effort” friendly replies that don’t read cold (e.g., “Thanks for flagging—nice catch!”).\n  - Safe small-talk starters that aren’t exhausting.\n  - Scripts to push back kindly: “I can’t take this on today. If X is highest priority, I can pause Y—does that work?”\n\n- Accommodations\n  - What accommodations are common/helpful for ADHD in office roles? (e.g., meeting buffers, written follow-ups, noise-canceling, flexible deadlines, protected focus blocks)\n  - How to bring it up with a new manager without oversharing, and when to go through HR.\n\n- Daily rhythms\n  - How you structure your day in hybrid settings (commute days are extra chaos for me).\n  - A 5-minute end-of-day routine that actually prevents next-day panic.\n  - Any body-doubling or virtual coworking setups for office folks.\n\nIf you’re ADHD (especially a woman/masked-for-years) and functioning well at a desk job, what made the biggest difference? Scripts, templates, screenshots of your calendar rules—anything concrete is gold.\n\nTL;DR: New to office job + late-diagnosed ADHD.

Moved in 8 months ago. In the last 6 weeks I’ve had both mice and (confirmed) bedbugs. Management sent an exterminator once (sprayed, no sealing, no follow-up). Since then: fresh mouse droppings, a mouse sighting last night, and I trapped 2 bedbugs in interceptors this week. Office keeps saying “we’ll schedule” and then goes quiet. I keep the place very tidy, food in sealed bins, did laundry/dryer on high, caulked small gaps myself, but the bigger holes around pipes/baseboards need real sealing.\n\nI’m ready to escalate but want to do it correctly so it actually gets fixed and I’m covered. NYC folks who’ve done this—can you sanity-check my plan and fill gaps?\n\nWhat I’ve done\n- Started a log with dates/times of sightings, bites, droppings, communications with mgmt.\n- Photos/videos of droppings, holes, and a bagged bedbug (labeled with date).\n- Interceptors on bed legs; mattress/box spring encased.\n- Emailed management requesting integrated pest management (sealing, traps, follow-ups), but responses are vague.\n\nWhat I think I should do next (please correct/advise)\n- Documentation:\n  - Keep catching/saving specimens (bedbugs in zip bags, dated), plus timestamped photos of droppings/holes.\n  - Email management again with a clear written demand and deadline (e.g., 7 days), requesting: bedbug disclosure history, licensed exterminator visits until eradication, sealing of entry points with proper materials (not foam), building-wide inspection/treatment if needed, and written treatment plan. Send via email + certified mail.\n- 311/HPD:\n  - Call 311 and file separate complaints for: “Mice in apartment” and “Bedbugs,” and note landlord non-response.\n  - Be ready for HPD inspection; don’t clean away all evidence before the visit—keep interceptors and labeled samples.\n  - After violations are issued, how long do owners typically get to correct? If no correction, do I call for reinspection or proceed straight to Housing Court?\n- Housing Court (HP Action):\n  - If conditions persist, file an HP action to compel repairs/extermination. What should I bring: my log, photos, specimens, copies of emails/letters, 311 complaint numbers, any exterminator paperwork?\n  - Any tips on completing the petition so it includes sealing/repairs and building-wide treatment if necessary?\n- Tenant protections/retaliation:\n  - Best practices to protect against retaliation (e.g., keep paying rent on time, store all communication in writing).\n  - If they try to push me to break the lease instead of fixing, can that be considered harassment?\n- Practical prep:\n  - Before an HPD inspection/exterminator visit, what’s the right balance between “prep” and leaving evidence visible?\n  - Are interceptors and encasements viewed positively by inspectors, or should I remove anything?\n- Neighbors/organizing:\n  - If multiple units are affected, how do we form a tenants’ association properly? Any NYC orgs that will help coordinate (Met Council on Housing, Legal Services, MFJ)?\n- Rent abatement:\n  - If this drags on, is it better to seek abatement through Housing Court as part of the HP case, or separately? I’m rent-stabilized (pretty sure)—should I also talk to DHCR?\n\nAlso, is there specific language that tends to get action from management? A short template would be amazing. I’m not trying to be hostile; I just want a paper trail and a fix that actually follows NYC’s IPM requirements.

I deleted the apps a few weeks ago; I don’t know if he has.\n\nHere’s my struggle: I want to have the exclusivity/STI talk like an adult, but my anxiety can turn this into a fishing-for-reassurance spiral (e.g., “Are you sure? What if you change your mind?”), which is not fair to either of us. I don’t want to interrogate him—I just want clarity and a plan.\n\nWhat I want:\n- Sexual exclusivity and recent STI testing before continuing unprotected sex\n- To be on the same page about dating each other exclusively\n- If he’s unsure, that’s okay, but then I need to keep things protected and slow down or step back\n\nQuestions:\n1) Is 2 months a reasonable time to ask for exclusivity?\n2) What’s a clean, low-pressure script that isn’t a reassurance loop?\n3) If he says he “needs more time,” how do I respond without people-pleasing but also not making it an ultimatum?\n\nDraft script I’m considering:\n“Hey, I’m really enjoying this and want to keep building it.

  "title: NYC tenant: bedbugs + mice for months, management slow-walking — what’s the real 311/HP action/abatement roadmap?\n self_text: Market-rate tenant in Brooklyn here. We’ve had both mice and (confirmed) bedbugs on and off since late June. Management keeps “sending someone” but it’s been piecemeal: a few glue traps for the mice, a quick spray in one bedroom for bedbugs, no prep checklist, no adjacent-unit treatment, and then radio silence for weeks. We’re still finding fresh mouse droppings and I’m waking up with new bites every few days.\n\nWhat I’ve done so far:\n- Documented everything (time-stamped photos of droppings, shed skins, bites; videos; emails with mgmt; exterminator business cards/receipts).\n- Sealed obvious gaps with steel wool/foam, encased mattress/box spring, bagged/heat-treated what we could.\n- Filed one 311 complaint but the super did a “touch-up” the day before, and the inspector didn’t enter our unit that week. No violation was issued.\n\nI’m looking for a step-by-step NYC-specific roadmap from people who’ve actually gone through this. Specifically:\n\n311/HPD\n- Best way to file 311 for pests so HPD actually inspects the unit and nearby units? Any keywords or details to include?\n- For bedbugs/mice, are these Class C? What correction timelines have you seen HPD enforce in practice?\n- Is it normal/expected to need multiple 311 calls to trigger an inspection?\n\nHP Action (Housing Court)\n- If management keeps slow-walking, when do you pull the trigger on an HP action to force repairs/extermination?\n- Do I need a lawyer for an HP action, or can I file pro se and still get a strong stipulation (integrated pest management, sealing entry points, follow-up treatments, adjacent-unit inspections)?\n- How long does an HP action typically take from filing to first appearance?\n\nRent abatement / money stuff\n- For market-rate tenants, is rent abatement realistic here? Do people usually negotiate it in the HP stipulation, or pursue separately (small claims/nonpayment defense)?\n- Is withholding rent a terrible idea in NYC unless you’re already in court? I’ve heard mixed advice.\n- Have folks gotten reimbursed for laundry/encasements/prep costs?\n\nObligations/disclosures\n- For bedbugs, can I formally request the building’s last 12-month bedbug history disclosure? Is there a template email or statute I should cite?\n- Are they required to treat contiguous units and seal entry points (not just spray) under Local Law 55/IPM?\n\nBuilding-wide angle\n- Several neighbors have similar issues. Is it worth forming a tenants association first, or is it faster to file individually and coordinate later?\n- Any orgs you recommend for coaching/templates (Met Council on Housing, Legal Aid/LSNYC, Housing Court Answers)?\n\nRetaliation\n- If I escalate (311 + HP action), how protected am I from retaliation in NYC? Anything specific I should do to document a timeline and keep communications in writing?\n\nI’m not trying to be a nightmare tenant — I just want a clean, safe place to sleep without treating this forever.

We’ve been dating ~3 months, 2–3 times a week, sleepovers, met a couple of each other’s friends. We haven’t defined anything. Early on she said she wasn’t looking to rush “labels,” and a few weeks ago she said she’s “not seeing anyone else right now” but also “not ready to delete apps.” I deleted mine around week 6 because I felt invested.\n\nContext that might color this: I was cheated on in my last relationship, so I’m trying to be self-aware about my triggers vs. reasonable standards. Last week her phone lit up when we were together and I saw a preview from her ex (“hope you had fun tonight”) and her reply (“lol you too”). She’s mentioned they were on/off and are “cool now.” It set off alarm bells for me, but I didn’t say anything in the moment.\n\nWhat I want: clarity. I’d like to be mutually exclusive, and to me that includes closing dating apps and some boundaries around exes (not late-night casual texting). I don’t want to police anyone—just be upfront about what I’m comfortable building.\n\nQuestions:\n- Is it reasonable to ask for exclusivity at the 3-month mark?\n- If we agree to be exclusive, is asking to pause/delete dating apps a fair part of that?\n- How do I state a boundary around ex-contact without it sounding like control?

For me that means focusing on each other and closing the apps. How does that land for you?”\n- “If you’re not ready, that’s okay, but I’m looking for exclusivity, so I’ll need to keep things casual or step back.”\n- “One other thing: frequent, late-night texting with an ex isn’t something I’m comfortable with in a relationship. I’m not asking you to do anything; I’m sharing my boundary so we can see if we’re aligned.”\n\nPlan is to bring this up on our next date, not as a gotcha about the phone, but as a clarity conversation.

  "title: NYC renter: recurring mice + bedbugs in “renovated” building, management stalling — what are my 311/housing court next steps?\n self_text: Brooklyn, free-market lease in a 1920s “gut-renovated” building (renovation ~2022). I moved in June. Since then:\n\n- Mice: First droppings in July. Caught 7 mice so far. Gaps under sink and around radiator/pipe chases; super stuffed some steel wool but no proper sealing. Exterminator comes “monthly,” lays glue traps, no exclusion work.\n- Bedbugs: First bites + one live bug on headboard in September; got photos and kept a specimen. Management sent a PCO who did a spray-only treatment for my unit, no inspection/treatment of adjacent units. Two more bugs found (one dead after treatment, one live in living room) in the last 3 weeks. Neighbors on my floor have mentioned bites but management says they need “proof” before inspecting them.\n- Other context: I documented everything (dated photos/videos, pest log, emails, exterminator invoices). HPD bedbug filing for the building shows prior bedbug activity last year. I have not withheld rent. I’ve done prep (laundering, encasements, clutter reduction).\n\nI’m at the point where I want to escalate but do it correctly. Questions for folks who’ve dealt with this in NYC:\n\n1) 311/HPD complaints: Do I file separate complaints for mice and bedbugs? File each time there’s new evidence, or once is enough? Any tips on wording so HPD actually inspects for both vermin and unsealed penetrations (Local Law 55)?\n\n2) Certified letter: Before 311, should I send management a final certified letter citing NYC Admin Code/LL55 (integrated pest management, sealing entry points, inspecting/treating adjacent units for bedbugs) with a deadline? If so, any sample language people have used that got results?\n\n3) Housing Court (HP action): Is it realistic to do pro se? What do I bring to the first appearance? Timeline from filing to inspection to an order? Have you gotten rent abatements tied to vermin violations while remaining in the unit?\n\n4) Withholding rent vs escrow vs paying and suing for abatement: What’s the NYC-normal playbook? I don’t want an easy path to a nonpayment case, but I also don’t want to give up leverage.\n\n5) Bedbug specifics: Are landlords required to inspect/treat all adjacent apartments once bedbugs are confirmed in one unit? Can I request heat treatment or a different PCO if the current vendor is doing spray-only? Any best practices for compelling building-wide inspection?\n\n6) Group action: Has anyone organized a building-wide HP action for pests? Did it help with compliance or abatements? How did you coordinate without getting on management’s bad side?\n\n7) Documentation: Beyond photos, dated logs, and email threads, should I send all future communications by certified mail? Anything else HPD/housing court judges especially like to see (e.g., dead mice/bug specimens in bags, 311 complaint numbers, neighbor affidavits)?\n\n8) Lease break: If this drags on, what’s the realistic path to negotiate an early termination or buyout based on habitability issues? Any phrases/approaches that worked for you?\n\nI can technically move if I must, but I’d prefer to either get this handled properly or exit without penalties. Looking for NYC-specific next steps, scripts, and “I wish I’d known this earlier” advice. Thank you!\n subreddit: AskNYC",
  "title: We said “let’s just see where this goes”—does that mean exclusive? I’m spiraling and don’t want to self-sabotage\n self_text: 30F, he’s 32M. We met 7 weeks ago on an app, 6 dates so far, we’ve slept together, text every day, and he’s initiated future plans (a show in 3 weeks and a hike we’ve been planning for next weekend). Before our last date he said something like, “I’m having a good time and happy to see where this goes.” I said I felt the same. That felt good in the moment, but now I’m realizing I don’t actually know what that means in 2025 dating-app land.\n\nI paused notifications for my apps but didn’t delete them. I opened one to find a screenshot of a restaurant he’d sent me and saw he was “recently active” on his profile. Cue the anxiety spiral. I’ve been cheated on before (I’m in therapy; also ADHD/anxious tendencies), so ambiguity + apps = brain gremlins. I don’t want to accuse him of anything or let my fear make me weird. I also don’t want to assume exclusivity that isn’t there.\n\nWhat I want: clarity and safety. I’m not looking to rush a label if he’s not there; I’m okay with “dating exclusively” as a step before “boyfriend/girlfriend.” My baseline: if we’re sleeping together, I’d like to be exclusive, take down apps, and do STI testing. If he’s not ready, I can respect that, but I’d want to slow down intimacy and keep my options open. I just need help phrasing this like an adult and not a panicked teen.\n\nQuestions:\n- Does “let’s see where this goes” typically imply exclusivity to you, or is it just a vibes checkpoint?\n- When is a reasonable time to ask for exclusivity? We’re at 6 dates, seeing each other about once a week.\n- How do I bring this up without sounding accusatory or like I’m giving an ultimatum?\n\nDraft script I’m considering for our next in-person date (not over text):\n“Hey, I’m really enjoying getting to know you and I’d like to keep building this. At this point I’m interested in dating each other exclusively and taking down the apps. How are you feeling? No pressure if you’re not there yet—I’d just rather be on the same page so we both make choices that fit what we want.”\n\nIf he says yes:\n- I’ll suggest we both remove profiles, schedule STI testing if needed, and keep talking about pace/expectations.\n\nIf he says he’s not ready yet:\n- I’m thinking: “Thanks for being honest. I’m going to slow down on physical intimacy and keep my options open, and we can check in again in a couple weeks to see where we’re at—does that work for you?” Is that reasonable, or is setting a check-in timeline weird?\n\nIf he says he prefers to keep things casual/see others:\n- I’ll thank him and bow out or shift to very casual without sex. I don’t want to try to audition for exclusivity with someone who’s not interested.\n\nOther notes:\n- I’m reminding myself that “recently active” can be misleading (opened out of habit, background refresh, etc.). I don’t want to make this about policing his phone. I want to make it about what I need to feel safe and invested.\n- I can feel my anxious brain trying to mind-read. My goal is to ask cleanly once, accept the answer, and act accordingly—no spirals, no surveillance.\n\nIs my script clear and fair? Anything you’d tweak to make it more “I” statements and less pressure? Also curious how others handle the apps/STI testing convo—do you pair that with exclusivity or handle separately?\n\nThanks—trying to do grown-up dating without letting past hurt drive the car.\n subreddit: dating_advice",
  "title: ADHD makes me a \"bad texter\" while dating — how do I set expectations without scaring people off?\n self_text: Hi all, 29F, recently diagnosed ADHD. When I start seeing someone from apps, I run into the same cycle:\n- I come in hot the first week (novelty/dopamine), then my executive function crashes and I go quiet for 1–3 days.\n- I don’t intend to ghost; I get message paralysis, then guilt, which makes replying even harder.\n- People understandably read it as disinterest or games, and a few have ended things after a missed “hey?” text.\n\nI want to be honest without oversharing or using ADHD as an excuse. I’m looking for practical, dating-specific advice:\n\n- What’s a good early script after exchanging numbers to set expectations?\n- Is it weird or off-putting to put “not a heavy texter, prefer planning + calls/meetups” on my profile?\n- How do I “repair” after a 24–72 hour gap without sounding flaky?\n- What cadence is reasonable before exclusivity—daily? every other day? quick check-ins?\n- If I’m getting overwhelmed, how do I pause respectfully instead of disappearing?\n- Should I suggest scheduled calls or voice notes? Any tips to make that feel natural?\n\nWhat I’ve tried: timers, “mark unread,” pinning convos, texting only at set times, and upfront “I’m slow by text.” Mixed results—some appreciate it, others say it feels like I’m not excited.\n\nI’m not looking for permission to be inconsiderate. I genuinely like connection and want to be thoughtful; I just need a sustainable communication style that fits ADHD and attracts people okay with lower-frequency texting.\n\nWould really appreciate concrete message templates, good boundaries that read well, and red/green flags in how someone responds to this. Thanks!\n subreddit: dating_advice",
  "title: Day 17 of no-contact after 6-year relationship — ADHD brain is screaming to “fix it.” How do you ride out the compulsions?\n self_text: 32F with ADHD here. My ex (34M) and I ended a 6-year relationship 2.5 weeks ago after months of eroded trust (lots of “just friends” DMs, half-truths, and me turning into a paranoid version of myself I didn’t recognize). I went no-contact because every “let’s talk it out” turned into circular arguments and more pain.\n\nI am holding NC (day 17) but it feels like white-knuckling. My ADHD makes the urge to “fix” things spike like an alarm. Ruminations hit at night, I compulsively rehearse texts, and then I get hit with the dopamine-binge of re-reading old messages. I’ve blocked him on everything but I still feel this itch to email or find some loophole. I don’t want to break no-contact and reset the clock.\n\nWhat’s helped you get through the urge waves, especially if you’ve got ADHD?\n\n- Immediate tools for 10–30 minute “I need to reach out NOW” spikes (body-doubling? timers? behavioral tricks that actually cut the urge?)\n- Safe “dopamine swaps” that don’t accidentally reinforce the loop (I keep falling into scrolling his old photos, which obviously makes it worse)\n- Do you fully block (email/phone) or mute/archive? Blocking helps me, but part of me fears missing “the message” and that triggers more rumination\n- Alternatives to journaling that don’t turn into obsessive timelines (unsent letters, voice notes, etc.)\n- Nighttime routines that stop me doom-looping at 1–3am\n- If you slipped and texted once, did you reset your NC counter or keep going?\n\nContext if helpful: we lived together, no kids, I’m in therapy and working on rejection sensitivity and emotional regulation. I’m not trying to get him back; I’m trying to retrain my brain not to chase relief through contact.\n\nI’d really appreciate practical, step-by-step things that worked for you in the first month. Scripts, app recs, even silly hacks. Thank you.\n subreddit: BreakUps"
