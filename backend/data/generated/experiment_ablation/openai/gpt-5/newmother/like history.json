  "title: WIBTA for telling my brother he can’t bring his dog to my first Thanksgiving?\n self_text: I (33F) am hosting my first Thanksgiving in our small townhouse. It’ll be my parents, my brother “Jake” (36M), my sister (30F), my husband, our 2.5yo, and our senior cat.  Jake has a 90lb “high-energy” doodle who he treats like a human. I love dogs, but his is untrained and reactive. In the last year alone at family gatherings he’s:  - knocked my toddler over twice,  - peed inside at my parents’ house (twice),  - counter-surfed an entire plate of appetizers,  - lunged and barked nonstop at my cat until we locked the cat in a room.  Our home is smaller and more open than my parents’ and there’s no way to fully separate the dog from the kitchen/dining area without shutting multiple doors, which would mean locking the cat in a bedroom all day (she’s 14 and gets stressed) and keeping my toddler corralled in the living room. The dog also whines/howls if crated and Jake refuses to crate him anyway because “it’s cruel on a holiday.”  I told Jake I’d feel better if he left the dog at home for this one day. I offered:  - to pay for a reputable day-boarder for the dog, or  - to host a second “leftovers” dinner next weekend that’s dog-friendly at a nearby park pavilion (I’d bring the turkey, sides, etc.).  He got offended and said “the dog is family” and “you can’t invite me and not my dog.” My mom is pressuring me to “keep the peace” and says it’s just one day and we can put the cat away and “watch the baby closely.” My husband is 100% on my side and pointed out we’ll be juggling hot pans, boiling gravy, a toddler, and a stressed cat—adding a 90lb untrained dog seems like a recipe for disaster.  I don’t want to exclude my brother, but I also don’t want chaos in a small space or to risk anyone getting hurt. WIBTA if I stick to “no dog at Thanksgiving at our house” this year?  Edit to add: We’ve tried “compromises” in the past (long leash, baby gate, keeping him on place) and it lasts 10 minutes before Jake caves because the dog whines. The dog has never bitten, but he is mouthy and jumps. My toddler is tiny and easily knocked over.\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for asking my sister to pay a “pet deposit” if she brings her dog to stay with us for the holidays?\n self_text: I (30F) live with my husband (31M) and our 14-month-old. We offered to host my family this year because we have the most space. My sister “Kara” (27F) wants to stay with us for 10 days…and bring her 90lb Great Dane mix.\n\nContext: Kara’s dog is sweet but totally untrained. He’s anxious, barks at every noise, jumps on people, and chases our cat. The last time they stayed for a weekend (this spring), the dog had two accidents on our living room rug, scratched the paint and trim on our nursery door when we closed it for nap time, and knocked over a baby gate. It cost us $220 to clean the rug and $180 to repair/paint the door and trim. Kara promised she’d start training him and hasn’t.\n\nWe now have a very curious toddler who is learning to walk, and I’m nervous about a huge, jumpy dog around her—especially since he’s food reactive (growls if our cat or anyone gets too close when he’s eating). I’m also worried about nap times being wrecked by barking.\n\nI told Kara she’s welcome, but we need to set some boundaries this time. I gave her three options:\n- Leave the dog with a sitter/boarding\n- Bring him but pay a $200 refundable pet deposit (we would return it if there are no accidents/damage), and agree to crate him at night/when we’re out, keep him leashed in the house during toddler awake times for the first couple days, use provided baby gates, and feed him in the laundry room with the door closed\n- Stay in a nearby pet-friendly Airbnb and join us for meals\n\nShe flipped. Said I’m “punishing” her for having a dog and that boarding is too expensive. She called the deposit “tacky” and “greedy,” and said the holidays are about family, not contracts. My parents are siding with her and told me to “show some Christmas spirit” and “stop nickel-and-diming your own sister.” For what it’s worth, we’re already paying for groceries and most meals while everyone’s here. My husband is fully on board with the deposit/rules or alternate lodging.\n\nI really don’t want drama, but I also don’t want more damage or safety issues with our baby. Kara says if the dog isn’t welcome “as-is,” then neither is she. I feel like I gave reasonable options.\n\nAITA for requiring a pet deposit and house rules or suggesting she find other accommodations?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for refusing to let my boyfriend store his motorcycle in my apartment over winter?\nself_text: I (27F) rent a 1-bedroom on the third floor of a walk-up in a big city. My boyfriend (29M) has a motorcycle that he keeps on the street. Last winter his cover got stolen twice, he got ticketed during snow emergencies, and he’s convinced it messed up his bike. Now that it’s getting cold, he asked if he can store the bike in my living room from December to March.\n\nI said no for a few reasons:\n- My lease explicitly says no gasoline/combustibles or motorized vehicles inside.\n- It’s a small apartment and the only place it would fit is basically blocking my balcony door (egress).\n- I don’t want oil/fuel smells or stains, and I’m worried about my security deposit and the safety issue.\n- We’d have to push a 400+ lb bike up three flights of stairs. Our building is old and the stairs are narrow.\n\nHe told me I’m being unsupportive and it’s “just for a few months.” He said he’d drain the fuel and put a tarp down so “it’s totally safe,” and that everyone does it and landlords only put that in leases to cover themselves. He also said paying for a garage or storage is a waste of money.\n\nI tried to compromise:\n- I offered to split the cost of a winter storage unit for the first month to help him out.\n- I suggested asking a friend with a garage/driveway or his parents (they live 45 minutes away).\n- I asked my landlord if there was any alternative like the basement bike room, and they said absolutely not for motorized vehicles.\n\nHe got annoyed that I asked the landlord (“now we can’t fly under the radar”) and told me I should just not say anything and let him wheel it up. He also said if I’m “going to be this controlling,” I should give him a full-time key and stop “policing” how he uses “our space.” For context, he doesn’t live with me—he stays over maybe 2–3 nights a week.\n\nHe’s vented to friends, and a couple of them are saying I’m making a big deal out of nothing and that a partner should be willing to “make space for his passion.” I feel like I’m just following my lease and basic safety.

  "title: AITA for asking my friend to pay her share of an Airbnb after she bailed 48 hours before and went on another trip instead?\nself_text: I (27F) planned a weekend trip with four friends (we’re all 26–29) to a nearby wine region. We booked an Airbnb months ago under my account. Total was $900 for two nights, and we all agreed to split evenly ($180 each). It was nonrefundable and clearly stated that on the listing/screenshot I sent when we booked.\n\nTwo days before we were supposed to leave, my friend “Mia” (27F) texted that she couldn’t come because money was tight and she needed to “reset mentally.” I told her I was sorry she wasn’t feeling great and asked if she could still send her share since we couldn’t cancel and it was on my card. I also offered to help find a replacement (we had two other friends who were maybe’s), but she said she “wasn’t up for dealing with logistics” and would “make it up to us later.”\n\nWe went without her. While we were there, another friend showed me Mia’s Instagram stories—she was posting from a lake two hours away with a guy she’s been seeing and another couple. It was very clearly an overnight thing (bonfire, morning coffee on a dock, etc.). I didn’t say anything during the trip because I didn’t want to be petty, but when we got back I texted Mia again asking for the $180. I kept it polite and said I hoped she was feeling better.\n\nShe replied that I was being insensitive and pressuring her when she had told me she “needed a mental health break.” She also said the lake thing was “spontaneous” and “basically free” because she didn’t pay for lodging (they stayed at the guy’s family cabin) and they cooked. I said I get that it was cheaper for her, but I still paid the host and everyone else covered their share like we agreed.\n\nNow our group is split. Two friends say she should pay because she backed out last minute and it wasn’t refundable. Another says I should let it go because it’s “just money” and she’s “going through stuff.” I’m frustrated because if she had been upfront about not wanting to spend the money on THIS trip and instead wanted to do something with her new guy, I could have filled her spot in time or adjusted plans. I also don’t love feeling like the bad guy for asking for exactly what we all agreed to.\n\nAITA for insisting she pay her share after bailing and doing a different trip instead?\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for asking my MIL to leave after she refused to take her shoes off in our house?\n self_text: Me (31M) and my wife (30F) just bought our first place and had a baby (7 months). We set a no-shoes rule inside because:\n- The entire first floor is light carpet and a big foam playmat where the baby crawls\n- We live in a rainy area and the entry gets muddy fast\n- It’s what I grew up with culturally\n\nWe keep a bench by the door with a basket of brand-new slippers in multiple sizes, plus disposable shoe covers for tradespeople or anyone who needs them. Everyone’s been fine with it—except my MIL (61F).\n\nMIL says taking shoes off is “demeaning” and also claims she has plantar fasciitis so she needs supportive footwear at all times. I totally get needing support, so I bought her a brand-new pair of supportive indoor-only house shoes (still in the box), and even offered to pay for a second set of her orthotics so she could keep a pair dedicated for our house. She refused both, saying it’s “not sanitary” to have separate shoes and “no one tells me what to wear.”\n\nOver the last few weeks, we’ve had Sunday dinners. Each time, she’s tried to walk straight in with outdoor shoes. I’ve reminded her politely, offered the shoe covers, offered the new house shoes, and she rolls her eyes and walks past me. Last week it was raining and she tracked wet dirt onto the baby’s playmat. I told her (calmly) we can’t do this anymore—either use the covers or the indoor shoes, or we’d have to reschedule. She said I was “power-tripping” and “humiliating” her, so I asked her to leave and told her we’d happily host again when she can respect the rule. She left furious. My FIL and SIL complied, took off their shoes, and stayed.\n\nNow my wife is upset with me for “embarrassing” her mom and says I should’ve just let it slide because it’s family and it’s her birthday month (??). MIL is demanding an apology and says if we want a relationship we need to “drop the control issues” and allow her to wear whatever she wants in our home. She’s also saying I’m ableist for not accommodating her foot condition.\n\nFor info:\n- I have offered multiple reasonable accommodations: indoor-only supportive shoes (brand new), shoe covers, paying for a second set of orthotics, a chair at the entryway so she can sit to change.\n- Every other guest (including elderly relatives and a neighbor who uses a cane) has used the covers without complaint.\n- We’re not singling MIL out; it’s a house rule for everyone.\n- Baby’s pediatrician didn’t “order” no-shoes, but did say anything that reduces outside dirt/chemicals on surfaces baby puts hands in is helpful.\n\nAITA for enforcing the rule and asking her to leave when she refused yet again?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for enforcing a no-shoes rule at Friendsgiving and handing out disposable slippers?\n self_text: I (30F) hosted Friendsgiving at our apartment this weekend. My partner (31M) and I live in a small place with a 9-month-old who’s crawling everywhere and putting literally everything in his mouth. We also just replaced the living room rug and have a hefty “professional cleaning or replace” clause in our lease.  When I sent the invite I included a note: “Please no shoes inside—slippers/socks welcome! We’ll have disposable slippers by the door.” I reminded everyone the week of, and again the morning of. I set up a bench, a shoe rack, disinfecting wipes, and a basket with brand-new disposable slippers in multiple sizes, plus a couple pairs of clean shoe covers for anyone who needed to keep footwear on for medical reasons.  Most people were totally fine with it. One friend “Ava” (29F) showed up in thigh-high boots as part of a whole outfit. At the door I offered slippers or shoe covers. She said taking the boots off would “ruin the look” and that I was being controlling about “a little dirt.” I explained (again) the baby/crawling thing, the lease clause, and that this had been on the invite. I even offered to let her keep the boots on if she wore the clean shoe covers, or to take photos in the hallway/stairwell first so she could get her outfit shots in. She refused and said she “didn’t dress to wear hospital socks.”  It got awkward. She said if I cared that much, she’d just leave, and walked out. Later she posted in our group chat that I embarrassed her at the door over a “silly rule” and made her feel unwelcome. Two people messaged me privately that she overreacted; one other friend said I could’ve “made an exception for one person” because it was a holiday.  For what it’s worth, I did make a discreet exception for another friend with custom orthotics—he used the shoe covers without issue. Everyone else wore socks/slippers, and the night went great.  Ava is now saying I owe her an apology for humiliating her and “policing” people’s clothing. I feel like I set clear expectations in advance and offered reasonable options, but I also don’t want to die on a hill of foam slippers.

  "title: AITA for refusing to host my sister’s gender reveal unless she follows “no-mess” rules?\nself_text: I (29F) own a small townhouse with a yard. Because I’m the only one in the family with a central place and outdoor space, my mom and sister (26F) keep asking to use my house for events. Last spring my sister asked to do a “tiny” engagement after-party at mine—she said maybe 15 people, just finger foods and photos. It turned into 45 people, champagne sprays, and three “biodegradable” gold/pink confetti cannons that absolutely were not biodegradable. Glitter and confetti were embedded in the deck boards and all over the grass. My neighbor complained to the HOA, which sent landscapers out twice. I had to shop-vac my lawn and pay a $150 HOA fine for “debris in common area” because some of it blew past my fence. I also had to sand and re-stain part of the deck where champagne sat too long and left sticky stains.\n\nSister and her fiancé left right after the cake “because we have brunch reservations tomorrow,” and never came back to help. She Venmoed me $40 “for cleaners,” which covered about a quarter of what I actually spent (extra yard cleanup, stain, supplies). I told her afterward that if we ever did another event, she’d need to help clean and we’d have to keep it low-impact.\n\nNow she’s pregnant and asked if she could do her gender reveal at my place in two weeks. She said “super minimal,” but the Pinterest board she sent has powder cannons, a cake smash, and colored smoke bombs for photos. I told her I’d be happy to celebrate at a park, a restaurant, Mom’s house, or even split the cost to rent the community room where they allow confetti and staff cleans—but if it’s at my house, there are conditions: max 20 people, no confetti, no powder, no smoke bombs, and she and fiancé must stay and clean until it’s back to normal. She got upset and said I’m “punishing her for one mistake” and “making her pregnancy about my anxiety.” Mom says I’m being dramatic and that “colored powder washes away.” For context, our HOA lists smoke effects as a fire risk in our very dry area and explicitly bans confetti/powder in shared outdoor spaces; the last fine was not fun.\n\nI offered alternatives (brunch in the yard with no reveal gimmicks, or I pay half to rent a venue), but she says that “kills the vibe” and that my yard is “the only place that feels like home.” My boyfriend (31M) says my boundaries are reasonable, but my bullet-point “rules list” might have sounded too formal.\n\nAITA for refusing to host unless we keep it no-mess—or for saying no altogether?\n\nEdit: The previous HOA fine was $150. The confetti labeled “biodegradable” still had plastic glitter. The champagne stain required sanding and re-staining a section of the deck. Sister says she’ll “put down tarps” this time; tarps didn’t help last time because people popped the cannons everywhere. Also, smoke bombs are explicitly banned by HOA rules. Sister says “it’s five minutes for photos,” but five minutes is all it takes if a neighbor calls it in.\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for asking my roommate to keep her cat in her room for one weekend so my allergic dad can visit?\n self_text: I (26F) share a 2BR apartment with my roommate “Kara” (27F) and her cat, Pickles. We’ve lived together a year. When I moved in, I knew about the cat and disclosed that I have cat allergies. It’s not the watery-eyes kind—my dad (58M) and I both have pretty severe reactions. I manage mine day-to-day with meds and two HEPA purifiers I bought for the common areas. I vacuum and mop more often than my share and I don’t touch the cat. It’s been fine enough for daily life.  My dad lives 4 hours away and hasn’t seen my new place. He’s been nervous to visit because the last time he was around cats (at my aunt’s) he ended up in urgent care with an asthma attack. He just told me he’s going to be in town for a medical appointment and asked if he could stay with me for two nights to save money.  I asked Kara if, just for those two nights (a Friday and Saturday), she could keep Pickles confined to her bedroom with the door closed so we can deep clean the living room and kitchen and set up extra filters. I offered to:  - Pay to board Pickles at a nice cat hotel, OR  - Pay for any supplies to make her room more comfy (extra litter box, scratcher, new toys), OR  - Swap chores for the month, AND  - Do a full deep clean of common areas before and after, and run my purifiers in her room too if she wanted.  I also said I’d keep my dad out of her room and we’d wear masks in the apartment. It would be two days, max.  Kara got really upset and said confining a cat is “cruel” and that it’s her home too. She said it’s a slippery slope if I can “banish” her pet from shared spaces. I reminded her this is a one-off medical accommodation, not forever, and that I’ve been accommodating the cat since I moved in (extra cleaning, filters, not hosting friends who are allergic, etc). She said if my dad’s allergies are that bad he should get a hotel because “we chose to live with a cat.”  I get that this is Pickles’ home and I’m not trying to change that. But it’s literally 48 hours, and I’m offering to spend my own money to make it as stress-free as possible. For what it’s worth, Pickles sleeps in Kara’s room most nights anyway and hangs there a lot when Kara works from home.  My dad can afford a cheap motel, but he’s doing this trip for his health and asked me specifically because we haven’t had a father-daughter weekend in a long time. I feel awful telling him no over something I thought was a reasonable compromise.  AITA for asking Kara to confine her cat or board her for one weekend so my dad can visit safely?  Edit to add: I did check our lease—no language about pets in common areas. Also, I’m not asking Kara to leave or to hide the cat permanently; just two nights with the door closed, with enrichment and frequent visits/attention from Kara. If the consensus is hotel, I’ll drop it.\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for unplugging the office microwave after my coworker kept reheating fish even after I explained I’m pregnant and get sick?\n self_text: I (29F) am 15 weeks pregnant and the morning sickness is still very much a thing. Strong smells set me off hard, especially fish and eggs. I work in a small office (about 12 people) with a kitchenette that doesn’t have a door, so whatever gets microwaved drifts right out into the open office.  One coworker (M30s) meal preps salmon and broccoli every day. I don’t care what people eat, but as soon as the microwave starts, the smell hits me like a truck. I’ve thrown up twice at my desk and once in the bathroom this past month from it. The first time, I politely told him I’m pregnant and sensitive to smells, and asked if he’d mind eating it cold or heating it in the microwave in the downstairs lobby (there’s a public one by the café), or even just cracking a window and covering it. He said “sure, I’ll try,” but kept microwaving it in our kitchen.  I brought it up again, this time suggesting I would shift my lunch time or that he could nuke it at a different time so I could step outside. He said he can’t change his macros/timing because he’s training for a competition and that “it’s just food.” I started keeping a fan at my desk, wore a mask, and sprayed the air freshener the second I smelled it (which he complained about because the spray gave him a headache).  I asked our manager (F40s) if we could set a “no fish in the microwave” policy for a few months, or at least ask him to use the downstairs microwave. She told me we can’t police people’s meals and suggested I WFH more (I do 2 days already; I can’t increase because of coverage). She did ask him to be “mindful,” but nothing changed.  Last week, after another salmon episode sent me sprinting to the bathroom, I unplugged the microwave and put a note on it that said “Temporary out of order—please use the downstairs café microwave (works great!).” I figured it would be a nudge without calling him out directly, and anyone who needed it could still plug it back in.  He came out of the kitchen annoyed, plugged it back in, microwaved his fish anyway, and then told me I was being “controlling” and “weaponizing pregnancy.” I told him I’ve tried every compromise, and I’m just asking for three months of using a different microwave that’s literally a 90-second walk away. He said I can’t expect the whole office to accommodate me.  Now a couple coworkers are split—some think it’s a reasonable ask for a temporary period; others say food rules are a slippery slope and I shouldn’t have unplugged the microwave. Manager told me to “find a way to coexist” and not touch shared equipment again.  AITA for unplugging the microwave and trying to force the issue? Or is he being inconsiderate by refusing an easy workaround when he knows it makes me physically sick?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for changing the locks after my roommate’s boyfriend made a copy of our key and kept letting himself in?\n self_text: I (27F) share a 2BR with my roommate “Lena” (26F). We’ve lived together for a year. Our lease and building policy both say only leaseholders can have keys, no exceptions. (The landlord is strict because there was a break-in a couple years ago by someone with an unauthorized copy.)  Lena’s boyfriend “Evan” (29M) started staying over a lot this summer—like 4–5 nights a week. A couple months ago he asked if he could have a spare key “for emergencies.” I said no, because of the policy and because I don’t want a non-tenant to have independent access when neither of us is home. I suggested that if he’s going to be here that much he could talk to the landlord about being added to the lease. He didn’t want that.  Fast forward: I came home two Fridays ago and my key worked, but the inside chain was on. I knocked, texted, called—nothing. After 40 minutes of sitting on the hallway floor, Evan finally opened the door. He’d let himself in to “wait for a package” and said he must have fallen asleep with his headphones on. I was late to a work call and furious. I reminded both of them that he should not have a key at all, and that the chain is for when you’re inside the apartment, not to block a roommate out.  Lena apologized but brushed it off as a one-time mistake. I told her again that the extra key needed to be returned. She swore he’d “just borrowed it.” The next incident was worse. Last week, at 6:10 AM, I was about to shower when I heard the front door unlock. It was Evan, coming to “grab his gym bag.” He startled me so badly I screamed, which woke our neighbor and led to a very awkward hallway moment with me in a towel. I texted Lena that this was not okay. She said she was sleeping and didn’t know he was coming by.  That day I emailed the landlord and explained there was an unauthorized copy floating around and I didn’t feel safe. Landlord re-keyed the main lock, installed a keypad (leaseholders only), and charged us the re-key fee per the lease. I paid it upfront and told Lena she could reimburse half or have Evan do it since he’s the reason. I also said that going forward, if she wants Evan to have independent access, he needs to be added to the lease or be there only when she is.  Lena blew up at me. She said I’m “weaponizing the landlord,” being controlling, and that it’s “basically the same” as him staying over—key or no key. She says I embarrassed her and made Evan feel “unwelcome in his second home.” She also refuses to pay any portion of the re-key because I “chose” to do it without “group consent.” I pointed out: 1) I’d already said no to the extra key, 2) the lease explicitly prohibits non-tenant keys, and 3) I was literally locked out once and walked in on once.  I offered compromises: if Evan gets added to the lease and passes the background check, fine. If not, he can be here when she’s here, but no solo entries and no keys. She’s still mad and says I owe them both an apology for “overreacting.”  AITA for going to the landlord and changing the locks?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for asking my brother to pay me if he wants me to watch his kids all summer?\n self_text: I (29F) work from home full-time. My brother “Jake” (33M) has two kids (6F, 9M). Our mom was supposed to help with summer care this year but she just had surgery and isn’t allowed to lift or chase after kids for at least 8 weeks.  Last week Jake texted me “Great news! We’re set for summer. I’ll drop the kids Monday–Friday around 8 and pick them up after 6.” I thought he was joking. He wasn’t. He had already told their day camp they weren’t coming, since “Auntie is home anyway.”  I told him I could cover a couple emergency days, but ten weeks of 10-hour days is an actual childcare job, not a casual favor—especially while I’m working. My apartment is small, I’m on calls most mornings, and I can’t be taking them to the pool/park all day. Also, he wants me to keep their high-energy dog because “he’ll be lonely.” The dog is not kid-friendly.  I proposed a plan: I’d take them 3 days a week max, 9–4, no dog, he’d provide lunch/snacks, and he’d pay me $300/week for both kids (which is less than any camp around here). I also said I’d do the first week free while he figures out a backup.  He blew up, called me greedy and said “family doesn’t charge family.” He told our aunt I’m “profiting off my niece and nephew” and now I’m getting group texts about how I should “just enjoy the time with the kids” because “they grow up fast.” Meanwhile, I still have to keep my job.  For what it’s worth, Jake makes more than I do and could afford camp; he just doesn’t like the price. He also suggested I use my lunch break to drive them to and from activities “since I’m not doing anything then.”  I love my niblings and I’m happy to help here and there, but this feels like I’m being voluntold into a full-time unpaid job I didn’t agree to. I told him my terms stand or he needs to re-enroll them in camp. Now he’s refusing to speak to me and my mom (who feels bad but gets why I said no) is stuck in the middle.

  "title: AITA for declining my sister’s childfree destination wedding and not sending a gift?\n self_text: I (29F) have two kids (5F and 2M) and a pretty tight budget right now. My sister (32F) is getting married in February. It’s a destination wedding at a resort in Mexico, three nights minimum, childfree. The cheapest room block rate + flights for me and my husband (30M) would be roughly $2,600 before food, outfits, airport parking, etc. If I went alone it’d still be about $1,800. On top of that, I would need childcare for three full days plus travel days, which we don’t have family for and would run about $500–$700. We can’t afford it, and even if we stretched, we don’t have anyone who can watch the kids that long.\n\nI told my sister months ago when the save-the-dates went out that we love her and we’re excited for her, but we can’t swing a childfree international trip right now. I offered to host/plan/fully pay for either an at-home shower or a post-wedding reception/party when they’re back so extended family and friends who can’t travel can celebrate. I also said I’d come to the bachelorette if it’s local (it’s not; it’s also a flight), and I set aside a day to take her dress shopping and another to help with invites and favors. I’ve tried to be present and helpful.\n\nShe seemed okay at first, but last week she called me crying and said I’m “making a statement” by not coming and that “siblings show up.” She also said it was “tacky” that I haven’t sent a gift yet when the registry opened (like two weeks ago). Our mom is now chiming in saying I should “figure it out,” implying I could put it on a credit card because “it’s once in a lifetime.” For context, my husband and I are finishing paying off a medical bill from my son’s ER visit in August, our car needs new tires before winter, and we’re trying to build a small emergency fund. Going would mean taking on debt we can’t immediately pay off.\n\nI told my sister I’m not asking her to change her wedding, I’m just declining an invitation we can’t accept, and that I’ll absolutely send a gift closer to the date (or after) within our means, but it won’t be from the high-end part of the registry. She said if I “really cared,” I’d prioritize the wedding over “random house expenses” and that not sending a gift now is “proof I don’t support her.”\n\nNow my dad says I should at least “show my face” by flying down for one night solo and “figure out childcare” because “people do it all the time.” That would still be over $1,000 with flights and a single night at the resort (they won’t allow non-guests at the venue). I feel like I’ve offered reasonable alternatives and support, and I genuinely cannot afford this without putting us in a hole.\n\nAITA for saying no—and for not sending a gift yet?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for telling my brother he can’t propose at my baby’s first birthday?\nself_text: I (29F) and my husband (31M) are throwing a small backyard party for our daughter’s first birthday next weekend. It’s a pretty big deal for us—after two miscarriages and a rough pregnancy, finally getting to celebrate her turning one feels huge. We’re doing a catered brunch, simple decorations, a smash cake, and a handful of family/friends. Nothing over the top.\n\nMy brother (26M) called me last week and asked if he could “do something special” during the party. I asked what he meant and he said he bought a ring and wanted to propose to his girlfriend (24F) when we gather everyone to sing and take photos. He said it would be perfect because “everyone will be there, the photographer is already there, and it’s a happy family moment.”\n\nI told him I love him and love his girlfriend, but I don’t want a proposal at my daughter’s birthday. I said he’s absolutely welcome to take photos, mingle, make a toast to our daughter, etc., but I don’t want the focus shifted. I offered to help him plan a separate surprise brunch the following weekend at the same place we’re ordering from, even offered to cover the balloons and a little cake for them.\n\nHe got really quiet, then said I was being selfish and dramatic and that his girlfriend “doesn’t like attention on her for long anyway” so it would be quick, and “no one even remembers first birthdays.” He also said it makes logistical sense since he already asked a friend to bring a nicer camera and he’s trying to keep costs down.\n\nOur mom called me later and said I was being “territorial over a one-year-old’s party” and it’s “cute” when couples propose at family events. She said it would be “a blessing” to have two celebrations in one and that saying no makes me look bitter. She also told me my brother already told a few cousins to be ready to “record the moment” (which annoyed me, because he asked me after apparently already planning it).\n\nI told my brother again: please don’t. He said he “won’t cause a scene” but that I’m “forcing him to delay a life milestone” for no reason. I told him a week isn’t a big deal and that this is about our daughter’s day and our family finally getting to breathe after a rough year. He hung up on me and has been sending passive-aggressive texts like “Hope the smash cake makes everyone feel special.”\n\nMy husband is fully on my side and said he’ll shut it down at the party if needed, but I don’t want it to get that far or embarrass anyone. I do genuinely want my brother to have a great proposal—just… not at my baby’s birthday.\n\nAITA for holding my boundary?\n\nEdit for clarity:\n- We did hire a photographer for the smash cake and family pics—friend of ours, already paid.\n- Brother’s GF is lovely but does like curated moments/photos. No idea if she expects a proposal soon.\n- Guest list is 25 people, mostly immediate family.\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for putting a keypad lock on my home office after my MIL kept “tidying” and I got written up at work?\n self_text: I (29f) work from home full time. My company handles client financial data, and part of my job requires me to follow pretty strict data security rules. We turned our second bedroom into my office. It’s where I take calls, store files, and keep my equipment.  My MIL (58f) lives 10 minutes away and has a habit of popping by “to help” when my husband (31m) is at work. She’s very much a “my house, my rules” type in her own home, and she brings that energy to ours. We’ve tried to set boundaries, but she’ll just let herself in (she has a key from when she used to dog-sit and we never got around to changing the locks) and start “tidying.” That includes moving my files, putting my sticky notes “somewhere better,” and once throwing away an envelope she thought was junk mail (it was a physical check from a client that I had to request reissued).  I’ve told her multiple times that she can’t come into my office during work hours. She says she’s “just being helpful,” I get stressed, my husband tells her to stop, she apologizes, and then a week later it happens again.  Two weeks ago, she came in while I was on a client Zoom. I’d put a sign on the door that said “Do Not Enter, Meeting In Progress.” I muted myself and said, “MIL, I’m in a meeting, please step out.” She laughed, said, “It’ll take one second,” moved behind me, and unplugged my label maker “so it doesn’t waste electricity.” My webcam caught the whole thing and my client commented. I was mortified. I got a written warning after my manager reviewed the recording because the client raised a concern about data privacy and interruptions.  I told my husband I was installing a keypad lock on my office door. He said that was “dramatic” and would hurt his mom’s feelings, but I said my job is not negotiable. I bought a simple keypad handle and put it on over the weekend. I gave my husband the code, told him I’d change it if he shared it, and texted MIL to remind her not to come over during work hours without checking first.  This Monday, while I was on my lunch break (door closed but not locked), I heard the front door and then my office knob jiggle. I locked it. MIL started knocking and saying she had soup for me and wanted to “straighten the cords.” I told her I couldn’t talk and would call her after work. She got huffy and left.  Wednesday it got worse. I heard movement and then my internet cut out mid-call. When I came out, MIL was in the hallway with a half-spilled travel mug and my router in her hands. She said she was “just dusting behind it” and had unplugged it because the lights looked “too bright.” She’d come in through the back, and when the office was locked, she decided to “help somewhere else.” I honestly lost it. I told her she needed to leave and that she is not allowed in our home on weekdays without my or my husband’s explicit yes, and under no circumstances is she to enter my office.  That night my husband said I was out of line, that I “escalated” things with the lock, and that his mom felt “treated like a thief in her own family’s home.” He also said “we don’t do locked doors in this family,” which… okay, but we are married and this is our house, not hers. I told him: 1) My company’s policy literally requires controlling access to printed client documents and devices, 2) I got written up because of her, and 3) if this happens again, I could lose my job.  Now she’s saying I embarrassed her, that she was only trying to help, and that “in our culture” (they’re very big on hospitality) you don’t lock family out of rooms. She claims she didn’t realize the router was “important.” My husband wants me to apologize for “the tone” and take the lock off after the holidays to “reset.” I said the lock stays, and if anything we should be changing the front door code so she can’t enter without asking.  AITA for installing the keypad lock and laying down a firm boundary after a write-up?  Edit to add:  - I’m not storing piles of paper—most things are digital, but there are still physical mailers, checks, and identity verification docs that pass through my hands.  - We have asked her not to come by during business hours unless invited. The pop-ins started when she began doing “walks” in our neighborhood after her gym class.  - Husband has his own office at work; he’s never had to navigate this at home and I think he underestimates how fast an interruption can become a HR issue.  - I offered to put together a list of genuinely helpful things she could do if she’s itching to help (drop off groceries on the porch, text before coming, etc.). She said that felt “cold.” \n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for canceling Thanksgiving at my place after my family insisted on bringing their dogs even though my kid is allergic?\nself_text: I (31F) offered to host Thanksgiving this year for the first time. We bought a small house in the spring and I was excited to finally have everyone over. My son (3M) has a diagnosed dog dander allergy and mild asthma. He wheezes and breaks out in hives if he’s in a house with dogs for more than ~20–30 minutes, even if the dogs are in another room. We carry an inhaler and have had to do urgent care once after a long exposure at my sister’s.\n\nMy sister (29F) and brother (34M) both have big dogs. They bring them literally everywhere. When I sent out the invite, I let everyone know we’d love to host but we can’t have dogs inside because of our son’s allergy. I offered options: I’d pay half for a dog walker/daycare that day, they could crate at home and we’d do an earlier dinner so they can get back sooner, or we could switch and have dinner at one of their houses without my kid (my husband and I would rotate in shifts so someone is always with our son at our place). I was trying to be flexible.\n\nThey both said that wasn’t “realistic,” they don’t board, and their dogs have separation anxiety. They said they’d bring them and “keep them on the porch” or “in the car with the windows cracked.” I said absolutely not—November here is cold and that’s not safe or kind, and dander on their clothes still sets my son off. I repeated that we cannot have dogs here for everyone’s sake, most of all my kid.\n\nCue my mom (56F) calling me “controlling” and telling me to give my son “a Benadryl and stop making a big deal out of it.” She said it’s “just a few hours” and I’m “ruining a family tradition.” For context, my parents have always allowed the dogs on furniture and at the table (yes, actually at the table) and my son’s gotten sick after every visit longer than 30 minutes. I usually leave early with him; they get annoyed when I do.\n\nAfter a week of back-and-forth, I told them I was canceling hosting. I’m not going to spend the holiday hovering with an inhaler and wiping hives while everyone argues with me. I said we’ll do a small dinner at home and anyone who wants to come dog-free is welcome to drop by for dessert. Now I’m getting texts about how I’m “punishing the whole family,” “hate dogs,” and I “made a promise to host.” My sister also sent me a link to an air purifier and said I should “just buy one” and stop “coddling” my son.\n\nMy husband thinks I did the right thing but suggested we could have tried to tarp off a room or something. I feel guilty that I got everyone’s hopes up, but I also feel like I gave a ton of alternatives and was clear from the start. AITA for canceling?\n\nEdit for clarity: We’ve tried hosting my family before for short visits (1–2 hours). Even with windows open and vacuuming after, my son reacts. We’ve done allergist testing; it’s not “in my head.” Also, putting the dogs “in the backyard” isn’t possible—our yard isn’t fully fenced yet and I’m not taking that liability.\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for telling my mom she can’t bring her dog to Thanksgiving after it destroyed my kid’s therapy equipment?\nself_text: I (32F) am hosting Thanksgiving for the first time this year. My husband (34M) and I have a 5-year-old son who is autistic and uses several sensory tools at home—chewelry, a weighted blanket, a crash pad, and a small indoor swing we hook up to a doorway for short sessions. These were not cheap and took us time and insurance wrangling to get.\n\nMy mom (58F) is obsessed with her dog. He’s a 2-year-old large mixed breed, super high energy, not aggressive but… chaotic. He’s not trained beyond basic sit/stay, and even that is hit or miss when he’s excited. She refuses to board him or leave him home because she “doesn’t trust anyone with her baby” and “he’s family.”\n\nTwo months ago we hosted a small Sunday dinner. I asked her to leave the dog at home because our son was having a rough week and startles easily. She guilted me (“you know how anxious he gets without me”). Against my better judgment I caved but made her promise he’d stay on leash. Within 10 minutes, the dog had yanked the leash out of her hand, barreled through the hallway, grabbed and shredded one of my son’s chewy necklaces, knocked over his crash pad (burst a seam), and left claw marks on the edge of the swing doorway mount. My son had a total meltdown, screamed for an hour, and refused to go near the swing for days. Mom said it was “an accident” and offered to “Amazon a replacement toy,” not understanding these are specific therapy items and not just random Amazon finds. She didn’t pay for anything.\n\nFast forward to now. I sent a group message with Thanksgiving plans and explicitly said “no pets, please.” Everyone said okay except my mom, who called me crying that I’m “punishing” her and “excluding her family member.” She says she’ll just “keep him in the kitchen” (…our house is open concept), or that we should shut our son’s gear in a bedroom. I said no: our son will need his stuff accessible and calm is the priority. I offered the following: she can come without the dog, or we can drop off a full dinner for her the next day, or we can move the time to earlier so she feels comfortable leaving the dog for fewer hours, or my husband can pick her up/drop her off so she’s away a shorter time. She says I’m being cruel and that it’s “just a dog and kids need to adapt.”\n\nMy siblings think Mom is being unreasonable but also say I should “compromise for the holiday” and let her bring the dog “just this once” to avoid a blowup. I feel like we did “just this once” and it cost us money and set my kid back.\n\nAITA for putting my foot down and telling her the dog is not welcome?\n\nEdit for clarity:\n- Yes, the dog is housebroken—this isn’t about potty accidents, it’s about chaos and damage.\n- Our son’s equipment is medically necessary for him to regulate. We cannot just put it all away; he uses it throughout the day.\n- I did ask Mom to pay for the damaged items. She said she “can’t afford it right now” and then sent me a $25 gift card.\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for asking my roommate to pay for my ruined couch after her cat destroyed it?\nself_text: I (26F) own the couch in our living room. It’s a mid-range fabric sectional I bought new last year for about $900. When my roommate “Kay” (28F) moved in 6 months ago, she asked if she could bring her cat, Miso. Our lease allows pets with an extra deposit, which she paid. I also said yes, because I like animals and figured we’d be fine with rules.\n\nFrom day one, Miso went after the couch. I bought two scratching posts, a cardboard scratcher, catnip, sticky furniture tape, a slipcover, and that bitter anti-scratch spray. Kay said she’d trim Miso’s nails regularly and keep her off the couch when possible. She did try for a while, but Miso is sneaky and persistent.\n\nAbout two months in, Miso also started peeing on one corner cushion. We took her to the vet; UTI was ruled out, so they said it was probably stress/territory. We cleaned with enzyme cleaner, kept doors closed, used a litter attractant, moved the box, etc. The peeing stopped, but the smell never totally left, and the fabric is warped/stained in that spot. Between the scratching and the stain, the couch looks truly awful.\n\nI’ve been as accommodating as I can: I agreed to the pet, paid for a lot of deterrents, rearranged furniture to block access, and I keep the slipcover on. But the damage is done. I told Kay I’d like her to help replace the couch or at least pay for the damage. I suggested $400, factoring in a year of use before she moved in (so not asking for full replacement), and the fact this is basically beyond salvage for resale or guests. I thought that was fair since the couch was in great shape before.\n\nShe’s upset and says:\n- Cats scratching is “normal wear and tear” for a pet-friendly apartment.\n- She paid the pet deposit, so that should cover damage (I told her that’s for the landlord if walls/floors are damaged, not for my personal property).\n- She “tried” to prevent it and can’t control a cat 24/7, so it’s not her fault.\n- Offering $50 is “more than fair,” since the couch was used.\n\nI said $50 is nowhere near the cost of the cushion replacement or professional cleaning that didn’t work (I have the receipt). I also pointed out she benefits from the couch daily, and I didn’t sign up for it to be turned into a scratching post/litter substitute. She accused me of being heartless toward animals and said I knew what I was getting into when I agreed to a cat.\n\nNow it’s tense. I told her I’d be willing to accept $300 if we can settle and move on. She’s called me an AH to mutual friends for “extorting” her and making her feel like a bad pet owner.\n\nAITA for asking her to pay a significant portion toward replacing my couch? Or is this just the cost of living with someone’s pet and I should eat it?\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for refusing to let my sister bring her untrained dog to Thanksgiving at my apartment?\nself_text: I (29F) am hosting Thanksgiving for the first time this year. My partner (30M) is on call, we have a small two-bedroom apartment in the city, a shy indoor cat, and a 2-year-old who is very much in the “grabby/tippy” phase. We’re keeping it simple—my parents, my sister “Lena” (32F), and my aunt and uncle. That’s it.\n\nLena adopted a very sweet but extremely anxious, 90lb rescue (think Great Dane/lab mix). I genuinely love dogs, but hers is…a lot. He jumps on people, counter-surfs, barks non-stop when overstimulated, and has had a couple of “warning snaps” at kids who ran up on him. He’s not reliably housebroken—she’s working on it, but there are still accidents. She doesn’t crate because she believes it’s “cruel” and says he comes everywhere with her because it’s part of his “rehabilitation.”\n\nWhen I sent the invite and general plan, Lena immediately replied “Great, I’ll bring [Dog].” I told her I wasn’t comfortable with that, given the small space, our cat, and our toddler. I said if she really wanted to bring him to the city, there’s a reputable daycare three blocks away that has holiday hours, and I’d even cover it. She got mad and said I’m “punishing” her for having a dog and excluding him like he’s not family. My parents chimed in that “it’s just one day” and I should be more flexible.\n\nI offered compromises:\n- She can bring him by for a brief outdoor visit at the nearby dog park Friday morning.\n- She can come for dessert after the toddler is in bed and the place is calmer (cat will be confined).\n- We can do a separate, dog-friendly day at her house next weekend and I’ll bring leftovers.\n\nShe refused all three and said if he’s not welcome, neither is she. She also texted in the family group chat that I “hate her dog” and that I’m being “ableist toward his anxiety” (her words), and now my mom is guilt-tripping me about “keeping the family together.” My partner thinks I’m being more than reasonable, especially since I offered to pay for daycare.\n\nFor additional context:\n- Our cat is terrified of dogs and will hide for days after encounters.\n- My kid is still wobbly around pets and grabs tails if we’re not on him 24/7.\n- We have a tiny galley kitchen and I’ll be juggling hot food and knives—having a giant, anxious dog underfoot is stressing me out just thinking about it.\n- Lena has brought the dog to multiple gatherings where he jumped on the table, stole food, and peed indoors. She always says he’s “still learning” and laughs it off.\n\nNow my parents are saying I’m “choosing a cat over my sister” and “making her miss a holiday,” and I’m honestly feeling guilty. At the same time, it’s my home, my kid, my cat, and my stress level. I thought covering daycare and offering two alternate ways to see each other was fair.\n\nAITA for holding the line and not allowing the dog at Thanksgiving?\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for feeding my toddler at my MIL’s Thanksgiving after she said “no snacks or you’ll ruin dinner”?\n self_text: I (29F) am married to Jake (31M) and we have a 2.5-year-old daughter. My MIL hosts Thanksgiving every year. It’s very formal, and dinner is always late. Last two years we’ve sat down around 7:30–8 pm because “the turkey needs to rest” and “we wait for everyone.” There are usually three hours of small talk and wine beforehand and, strangely, my MIL banned appetizers last year because “people fill up.”  This year, knowing our kid melts down if she doesn’t eat by 6 pm, I texted MIL a week out asking if I could bring a small toddler-friendly plate (plain pasta, fruit, and a yogurt) to feed our daughter around 5:45 and then she could sit with us at dinner and nibble or skip. I specifically said I’d keep it out of the kitchen and clean up after. MIL replied, “No outside food, please. It ruins appetites and looks tacky in photos. She can wait like everyone else.”  I tried to compromise and asked if I could quietly feed her in the car before we came in or in a back room. MIL said that would still be “disrespectful to the hostess” because Thanksgiving is about eating together. Jake told me to let it go and we’d “figure it out,” but when I asked what the plan was, he didn’t have one.  Day of, we arrive at 4:30. By 5:45 our daughter is getting hangry and clingy, and the kitchen is a madhouse. I took her to a quiet corner, pulled out the Tupperware I’d brought in my tote (plain mac, sliced strawberries, yogurt), fed her quickly, wiped everything down, and tossed the trash in our bag to take home. No mess, no smell, no fuss.  MIL noticed around 6:15 when she came to collect everyone for a toast and saw the empty container. She got upset and said, “I told you no snacks—now she won’t touch my food.” I said calmly that I asked ahead of time, our daughter’s bedtime and blood sugar are not flexible, and we’re not asking anyone to rearrange dinner—just feeding a toddler. SIL (childfree) chimed in with, “It’s one day—teach her to wait.” BIL said it was “rude to ignore the host.”  Dinner got served at 7:40. Our kid sat nicely and ate a roll and a few green beans and colored. No tantrum, no mess. After dessert MIL cornered me and said I undermined her, that “the photos look silly because she isn’t eating like the rest of the family,” and that “next year you can host if you want to make your own rules.” I said, “Okay, we probably will.” We left at 8:15 to get our daughter to bed.  Now there’s a family group text about “apologies owed to the hostess” and Jake says I could have just “waited another 30 minutes” to keep the peace. I feel like we did the least disruptive thing for our child’s needs. AITA?  Edit: For clarity, I didn’t feed her at the table. I sat with her in a den off the foyer and cleaned everything. Also, our daughter has no medical issues—she’s just two, and waiting 2.5–3 hours past her normal dinner time is a meltdown waiting to happen.\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: 4yo refuses to wear a coat in freezing temps — consequences or compromise?\n self_text: We moved from a mild climate to the Midwest this year and our 4.5yo is flat-out refusing winter gear. We’re talking coat, hat, mittens, even boots some days. It’s been 20–30°F with wind and light snow, and preschool goes outside daily if it’s above 15°F. Teacher says our kid often refuses the coat and just stands there shivering but still says “I’m fine!”  What we’ve tried:  - Letting him choose (color, style) — picked it in the store, still won’t wear it at home/school. - Layers: merino base layer + fleece + thin shell (less bulky than a puffer) — still “too tight!” - Removing sensory triggers: soft tags, seamless base layer, balaclava instead of scarf, mittens vs gloves. - Practice/play: wearing the gear indoors for 5–10 min while doing a favorite game; sticker chart for outdoor time with gear on. - Scripts/choices: “Hat or hood?” “Mittens on first or last?” “Coat stays open or zipped?” - Modeling and peer pressure: we all gear up together; he still digs in.  Car seat note: We don’t buckle him in a puffy coat; we use a blanket in the car and put the coat on after. The battle is the walk from the car to school and outdoor play at school. We don’t want him to get sick/cold injuries, but we also don’t want to turn this into an hour-long meltdown twice a day.  Questions:  - Any gear recs that feel truly non-restrictive for sensory-sensitive kids? (Brands/models for thin warm coats, mittens that actually go on, boots that don’t feel heavy?) - What consequences/limits are reasonable here? (E.g., “No coat, no outside,” vs letting him feel a bit cold for a couple minutes to learn, but safely.) - Any scripts that worked for your strong-willed 4yo to make this a non-negotiable without a blow-up?  Is this just a phase that passes once the novelty of winter wears off, or should we expect a months-long standoff? Tips appreciated!\n subreddit: Parenting",
  "title: AITA for telling my friend he can’t propose at my housewarming?\nself_text: I (29M) and my fiancée (28F) just bought our first place and we’re throwing a housewarming in a couple weeks. It’s a casual thing with snacks/drinks, and my fiancée’s grandma is coming to do a small cultural blessing for the home at the start (nothing huge, just meaningful to her).\n\nMy best friend “Kyle” (30M) called me yesterday to say he wants to propose to his girlfriend “Maya” (27F) at our housewarming because “everyone will be there anyway,” and he wants to save on organizing a separate event/photographer, etc. He offered to bring a “proposal cake,” balloons, and said he’d have the photographer “hide and capture the moment.”\n\nI told him I’m happy for him, but no—this is our event, we’ve already told family the plan, and we don’t want the night to become about something else. I also know Maya has mentioned wanting something intimate and not super public, so I’m not even sure she’d love a surprise proposal in a crowd.\n\nKyle got upset and said we’re being selfish and “controlling a harmless happy moment.” He suggested he’d do it “after your little blessing thing” so it wouldn’t overshadow, or even “near the end so it’s like a bonus.” I still said no. We have a personal rule about no big announcements at other people’s events, even good ones.\n\nHe’s now saying if he can’t propose there, he and Maya might just skip our housewarming because it will “hurt too much” to hold back the surprise. Some friends in the group chat are split—half think it’s rude to hijack, half think I’m overreacting because “it’s a proposal, not a funeral.”\n\nFor context:\n- I offered to help him plan something separate, even host a dedicated engagement party for them in a month. He said the whole point is the built-in audience and photographer costs.\n- My fiancée is already anxious about hosting, and she’d be crushed if the focus turns to someone else (and we also don’t want Grandma’s blessing to feel like a prelude to a bigger, unrelated thing).\n- Kyle says Maya “definitely wants it this year,” and he doesn’t want to wait until after the holidays.\n\nAITA for saying he absolutely cannot propose at our housewarming and that if he’s going to make it a condition, he shouldn’t come?\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for telling my SIL she can’t bring her dog to Thanksgiving at our new house?\n self_text: My husband (32M) and I (30F) bought our first home this summer and offered to host Thanksgiving for both sides — about 14 people total. It’s our first big holiday and we’ve been excited (and a little stressed) getting the place ready.\n\nMy SIL “K” (27F) has a 70lb rescue who is very sweet with her but…not great with crowds. He jumps on people, counter-surfs, and has had a couple incidents with kids (nothing severe, but he snatched a hot dog out of my 4yo nephew’s hand at a BBQ and scratched his arm, and he knocked over my MIL last Christmas coming in the door).\n\nWe also have a 10-month-old who is crawling, a couple of nieces/nephews under 6, and my dad has mild dog allergies. So I told K that, for this one day, we’d prefer she not bring the dog. I offered multiple alternatives: I’d pay for a day of boarding or a Rover sitter, I’d cover a doggy daycare, or she could come for dessert later after he’s settled. I even said if it’s truly a separation anxiety issue, I’d set up a quiet gated area on our patio for short stretches if she needed to bring him for drop-in goodbyes — but not for the whole meal.\n\nK said the dog is “family” and “goes where I go.” She says crating/boarding is cruel and that we’re being “anti-dog” and “acting like it’s a China cabinet we’re protecting.” My MIL is backing her and suggested we “compromise” by keeping the baby upstairs during the meal so the dog can roam. (…What?) My parents think it’s common sense to keep the dog home for a crowded holiday.\n\nThis has turned into a bigger deal than I expected. K now says if the dog isn’t welcome, she’s not coming. I told her I’d be sad if she missed it, but I’m not budging on no dog for Thanksgiving. Husband is on my side, but his mom is making noises about “family being more important than rules.”\n\nI don’t hate dogs — we’re actually planning to adopt in the future — I just don’t think a reactive, untrained big dog + lots of food + small kids + someone with allergies is a good mix at a crowded holiday in a new house.

  "title: AITA for refusing to let my boyfriend use my car for a job interview because he’s not on my insurance?\n self_text: I (26F) own a small sedan that’s in my name and insured under me only. My boyfriend “Kyle” (29M) has a valid license but is not listed on my policy. About a year ago he borrowed my car “just to run to the store,” got a speeding ticket, and I only found out when the notice came in the mail. We had a big fight and I told him no more driving my car unless we added him to my insurance. I got a quote at the time and it would’ve raised my premium by nearly $90/month. We agreed that wasn’t doable, and he said it was fine.\n\nHe’s been unemployed for a few months. Last week he got an interview 40 minutes away (great!). The day before, he asked to take my car because the bus route would be two transfers and 90 minutes, and rideshare would cost too much. I work from home, so I didn’t technically need the car that morning, but I said no because he’s not on my insurance and if anything happened, I could be on the hook. I offered to wake up early and drive him there, wait at a coffee shop nearby, and drive him home. He said that made him feel like a child and he wanted to handle it himself.\n\nHe pushed back that “everybody does it,” that cops won’t pull him over for nothing, and that “it’s just one time.” I told him I’m not risking my insurance or potentially losing my car if there’s an accident. He got angry and said I was choosing a “what if” over his future. He ended up deciding not to go rather than take the bus because he said he’d show up sweaty and late.\n\nNow he’s telling me I cost him a job. His sister texted me that I should “support your man” and that I was being controlling over “a stupid technicality” (her words). For context: Kyle does contribute to rent and utilities when he’s working, and he’s generally good to me. But I feel like transportation isn’t automatically my responsibility, especially if he refuses the solutions I offered.\n\nAITA for sticking to my boundary and not letting him drive uninsured under my policy?\n\nEdit: A few people asked—he did try to reschedule when he realized the bus would be rough; they told him they were only interviewing that afternoon. I also offered to pay half a rideshare; he said no because it “wasn’t worth it if I’m in the hole before I even get the job.”",
  "title: AITA for charging my siblings per-plate for Thanksgiving after they refused to bring anything?\n self_text: I (29F) offered to host Thanksgiving for the first time. Normally our mom hosts, but she’s recovering from surgery and asked us to either keep it simple or do a potluck. My siblings (33M, 27F) both immediately said, “We’ll just come to yours, you love cooking,” and then sent me a “must-have” list: turkey and prime rib, mac and cheese, GF pies for my sister, vegan mains for SIL, three different sides, charcuterie board, kids’ options, craft beer, etc.\n\nI told them I was happy to host, but asked them to either bring a dish or split the grocery bill. They both said money is tight before the holidays and “a host shouldn’t nickel-and-dime guests.” I priced out a reasonable menu (not even the prime rib) and it was about $320 before alcohol. I said if they couldn’t contribute, I’d scale the menu to what I can afford: turkey, two sides, one pie, non-alcoholic drinks. They pushed back and said “it’s not Thanksgiving without [the list].”\n\nSo I sent a simple breakdown: $20/adult, $10/kid covers turkey, sides, pie, NA drinks. BYOB and any specialty dietary items (I can prep them if they supply). I also offered an alternative: we skip the big meal and just do pie and coffee at Mom’s to keep it easy on everyone.\n\nNow they’re calling me tacky for “charging family.” My brother said he’s not “attending a ticketed dinner,” and my sister says I’m excluding her by not just buying the GF/vegan things myself. Mom says she understands both sides but is too exhausted to referee. My boyfriend thinks the per-plate idea is fair since they demanded a menu and refused to bring or split.\n\nAITA for putting a per-plate cost on Thanksgiving instead of footing the entire bill or cooking a pared-down menu they don’t want?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for refusing to let my MIL sleep in our bed when she visits?\n self_text: I (29F) and my husband (31M) live in a small 2BR apartment. We turned the second bedroom into a proper guest room with a queen bed, blackout curtains, and a little desk because both sets of parents live out of state and visit a few times a year.  My MIL is coming for five nights over Thanksgiving. A week ago she called and told my husband that, in her family/culture, the eldest guest is always given the “best bed” in the house, which to her means our bed. She said she can’t sleep well on “guest mattresses,” has back issues, and would “feel disrespected” being sent to the spare room like a “kid’s sleepover.”  For context: our guest bed is a newer medium-firm hybrid with a topper, and the room is quiet. Our bed is a memory foam king. We keep our room pretty private for… obvious reasons, but also because I work early shifts and keep some personal medical stuff in there (I’m a nurse and odd hours mean I stash uniforms/gear in our room). I’m not comfortable with anyone, even family, sleeping in our bed. I said I was happy to swap mattresses (move the guest mattress into our room so she gets the “master” room), buy her a firmer topper, or pay for a nearby hotel for part/all of the stay if her back is that bad.  MIL said none of that is acceptable because “it’s about respect, not accommodations.” She specifically wants our bed and our room. She also told my husband that if I “can’t share,” it says a lot about how I was raised. He tried to smooth it over by suggesting we do the mattress swap and I would sleep in the guest room so I can still get ready for work without waking her. She told him that was “performative” and that I was “gatekeeping the house.”  I told him I’m not comfortable with someone else in our bed, full stop. I offered to launder everything, change sheets daily, whatever makes her most comfortable—just in the guest room. He said it’s “one week to keep the peace.” I said it’s our boundary.  She’s now texted in the family group chat that she’ll “just suffer” in the guest room. SIL and BIL chimed in that I’m being controlling and “it’s literally just a bed.” My parents think this is a bizarre hill for MIL to die on and told me not to cave on a boundary that makes me uncomfortable in my own home.  MIL arrived yesterday. She made a big show of looking around the guest room and saying “Well, I guess this will do.” She’s been cool toward me but perfectly pleasant to my husband. He’s clearly annoyed with me and said I made the visit “tense over something that costs us nothing.”  AITA for refusing to let MIL sleep in our bed even after she said it’s cultural and for back pain?  Additional info: we did offer to switch the entire rooms for her (she in the master, us in the guest) so she’d have the bathroom proximity and space—she refused because the “symbolism” is the bed itself. Also, she has visited twice before and used the guest room without comment; this is the first time she’s ever demanded the master bed.\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for refusing to attend my sister’s childfree wedding 10 days after giving birth?\n self_text: I (29F) just had my first baby last week. My sister (32F) is getting married next weekend. When she set her date last year it was fine, but I ended up getting pregnant and my due date was very close to the wedding. Baby came a few days late, so he’ll be 10 days old on her wedding day.  Her wedding is strictly childfree. I completely respect that and didn’t push back while I was pregnant because we didn’t know exactly how things would line up. I figured if it was too close, I’d just sit it out.  Now that he’s here, I’m breastfeeding and we’re in the cluster-feeding/no predictable schedule phase. I can’t leave him for more than an hour or so, and I don’t have a pumped stash built up yet. I asked my sister if I could attend the ceremony with the baby strapped to me (I’d sit in the back and slip out at the first peep) and then skip the reception entirely. My husband would drive us and take the baby to the car if needed. I emphasized I didn’t expect to be in photos or anything—just wanted to support her for the vows and then go home.  She said no, that “childfree means childfree,” even for newborns, and that if she makes an exception for me, other people will be upset. She suggested I “just pump” or hire a sitter/doula to stay with the baby at a nearby hotel. I said I’m not comfortable leaving a 10-day-old with anyone, and I physically can’t pump enough yet. She told me I’m making her day about me and should “figure it out like everyone else.”  Our parents are siding with her and offered to pay for a hotel room and a postpartum doula for the day. I know that’s generous, but I still don’t feel okay about it. I’m exhausted, bleeding, and honestly not ready to sit through a long ceremony in a tight dress while engorged, worrying my baby’s screaming down the hall.  I RSVP’d no for both ceremony and reception, and now my sister is furious. She says I’m “choosing a baby over her once-in-a-lifetime day” and that I could have “planned better” (???). For what it’s worth, I didn’t announce my pregnancy at any of her events, haven’t asked to bring the baby to the reception, and even offered to watch the livestream her venue provides so I wouldn’t be a disruption.  I feel like I tried to offer the least intrusive middle ground and got shut down. AITA for standing firm and not attending at all?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for moving my food into a locking mini-fridge in my room after my roommate kept eating my medically restricted meals?\n self_text: I (26F) live with a roommate “Kara” (27F). I have Crohn’s and celiac, so I meal prep very specific, expensive food on Sundays. Think: low-FODMAP, strictly gluten-free, carefully portioned so I don’t flare. I label every container with my name and “medical diet—please don’t eat.”\n\nSince August, Kara has eaten my prepped meals at least six times. Each time she promises to replace them, but she brings back regular frozen meals or pasta I can’t eat, or just Venmos me $10 when the ingredients were $40+. Twice I ended up with a flare because I had no safe food and DoorDashed something “GF” that clearly wasn’t.\n\nWe had multiple sit-downs. I offered to designate shelves. I offered to buy colored bins. I put big notes on the lids. She says she “forgets” or “was drunk” or “was sure you wouldn’t mind one.” Last week she ate four out of six of my prepped lunches while I was at work. I snapped and bought a small locking mini-fridge for my bedroom and moved all my food and ingredients into it. I also bought a $10 outlet meter to estimate electricity and told Kara I’d cover the extra (it’s like $3–$5/month).\n\nKara is furious. She says it’s “prison vibes,” I’m making the common areas hostile, and I’m “punishing” her for a few mistakes. She also says it’s unfair utilities-wise and demanded I cover $50/month “for the inconvenience,” or move my food back. She pinky-swore she’ll “try harder” but honestly I don’t trust her anymore. She also told mutual friends I’m “controlling” and “hoarding” food when we’re supposed to share a home.\n\nFor clarity:\n- We do not share groceries. We split basics (paper towels/cleaners) and otherwise buy our own. She has her own shelves in the fridge and pantry.\n- I did not lock the household fridge. I only moved my stuff into a locking mini-fridge in my room.\n- I offered to pay the exact extra electricity and even a bit more to keep the peace. She wants $50.\n- The last incident directly caused a flare that had me in urgent care. This isn’t just “annoying”—it makes me sick.\n\nOur lease has 6 months left.

  "title: AITA for refusing to let my sister bring her toddler to our “no kids” cabin weekend I paid for?\nself_text: I (30F) booked a mountain cabin months ago for a girls’ weekend with my sister “Rae” (33F) and three friends. When I sent out the invite, I was super clear: no kids or pets. Not because I hate kids, but because the place has a steep deck, a hot tub with no gate, and a ton of fragile decor. The listing itself says “not suitable for children under 6” due to safety/liability.\n\nEveryone agreed, including Rae, who said she’d line up a sitter for her 2.5yo. We split the cost evenly and everyone Venmo’d me. We’ve all taken PTO and coordinated rides, groceries, and activities.\n\nCut to this week: Rae’s sitter backed out. She texted the group saying she’s bringing her kid “because family comes first” and that we’ll “just have to make it work.” I told her I’m sorry the sitter fell through, but A) the rental explicitly prohibits young children and B) we set the no-kids expectation months ago. I offered to: reimburse her share, help pay for a backup sitter, push her share to a future weekend brunch/spa day, or let her drop by my place Sunday night when we’re back so she doesn’t feel fully left out. I also said if the whole group wanted to pivot to a kid-friendly place, I’d explore it—but we’d lose 50% to cancel and the only kid-friendly cabins left are more expensive and 90+ minutes farther.\n\nRae blew up, saying I’m prioritizing “vibes over family,” that I “don’t understand motherhood,” and that if I don’t allow her toddler, I’m “excluding her by default.” She wants to bring her kid or get everyone else to change the plan. Our mom called to pressure me to “compromise for your sister.” One friend feels bad and suggested we “just risk it,” but another said that’s a huge liability and she doesn’t want to be responsible if something happens.\n\nFor context: at a BBQ this summer (also listed as no-kids), Rae brought her toddler anyway. He reached for someone’s hot mug and ended up with a minor burn (he’s okay, thank God). It really shook me and is part of why I’m strict about safety in spaces that aren’t kid-proof.\n\nI get that childcare falls apart sometimes, and I know that sucks. But the rules were clear, the rental is clear, and I offered multiple alternatives/refunds. Now Rae says I’m a monster and is threatening to “never do trips with me again.” AITA for sticking to the original plan and not allowing her to bring her toddler?\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for invoicing my brother after he “borrowed” my car and racked up tickets?\nself_text: I (29F) own a small hatchback I use to commute. My brother (24M) has been staying in my spare room for two months between leases. He doesn’t have a car and uses my place to get to work and see his friends. Ground rules were: no guests after 10pm, clean up after yourself, and don’t use my car without asking. I keep my keys on a hook by the door out of habit.\n\nTwo weeks in, I noticed extra miles and fast food trash in the car. He admitted he took it “just to run to the store.” I told him it was not okay and to ask next time because of insurance, tolls, etc. He said he got it and wouldn’t do it again.\n\nLast week, I woke up and my car wasn’t there. He’d taken it overnight. He said Lyft was “surging” and he didn’t think I’d mind since he’d “bring it right back.” When it came back there was a street sweeping ticket on the windshield ($78), two toll-by-plate notices came in the mail ($56 total because the transponder was in my purse and he drove through anyway), the gas light was on, the interior was a mess, and there’s a shallow scuff on the rear bumper that wasn’t there before. No note, no gas, no apology. Just a “my bad” text.\n\nI sat him down that night and showed him a breakdown:\n- Street sweeping ticket: $78\n- Toll-by-plate + fees: $56\n- Gas he used (based on miles, tank, and price): $40\n- Interior detailing (because there’s sauce all over the console and it smells): $85\n- Body shop estimate for the scuff (I got a quick quote): $120\n\nTotal: $379. I told him I’d waive the detailing if he cleaned it properly himself and the gas if he filled the tank by morning, but the tickets/fees and repair were on him. I also moved my keys upstairs.\n\nHe blew up and said “we’re family, not roommates” and I shouldn’t “nickel-and-dime” him while he’s struggling. He said if he’d asked, I would have said no, so he “didn’t want to stress me out.” He also said the scuff “could have already been there” (it wasn’t) and that tickets “happen.”\n\nHe called our mom, who then called me to say I was being cruel over “a few tickets” when I have savings and he’s trying to get on his feet. She told me to “let this one go,” that “he’s learned his lesson,” and that “you’re single with no kids; you can absorb it.”\n\nI told my brother he needs to pay for the tickets and repair by Friday or make other arrangements for housing by the end of the month because I’m not comfortable having someone who doesn’t respect boundaries in my house. He accused me of “making him homeless” over “a car.” He’s now refusing to do the agreed chores and slamming doors. I’m second-guessing myself because I don’t want to be heartless, but I also feel like if I don’t hold the line this will keep happening.\n\nAITA for invoicing him and threatening to kick him out if he doesn’t pay?\n\nEdit for clarity:\n- My insurance explicitly states only listed drivers have permission. He is not on my policy. If he had an accident, it could get messy for both of us.\n- I’ve lent him my car before with permission for a specific errand while I was home; he returned it with gas and no issue. This is about taking it without asking and leaving me with the consequences.\n- I offered a payment plan if he can’t do it at once. He refused the idea of paying at all “on principle.”\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for refusing to send my SIL the family recipes after she monetized them on TikTok?\nself_text: I (29F) come from a big Greek family where food is basically our love language. My yiayia passed last year and left me her handwritten recipe book because I’m the one who learned to make a lot of her dishes with her (spanakopita, koulourakia, avgolemono, etc.). It was never a secret book, but it was kind of an unspoken “keep it in the family” thing, especially a couple of her holiday dishes that she made only for us.\n\nMy SIL “Tara” (31F), married to my brother (33M), started a TikTok during the pandemic for cheap meals and kitchen hacks. It was cute at first. Last Christmas, I typed up a few recipes for our cousins’ group chat after people asked, including my yiayia’s lemon potatoes and a simplified galaktoboureko. I didn’t think much of it.\n\nFast forward to spring: I get tagged by a cousin in one of Tara’s TikToks where she’s making my yiayia’s potatoes and calling them “Greek-Style Viral Lemon Crisps.” She didn’t credit my grandma or mention they were family recipes. I DM’d her like, “Hey, would you mind at least saying these came from our family? It feels weird.” She said recipes aren’t copyrightable, everyone tweaks things, and “it’s actually free promotion for your culture.”\n\nThen she launched Patreon “premium recipe cards” and a paid virtual class for “Holiday Greek Classics” where she planned to teach yiayia’s lamb and a dessert we literally only serve on Easter. That felt like crossing a line. I told her I wasn’t comfortable with her monetizing those family dishes that were shared in a family chat. She said I was gatekeeping and trying to sabotage her small business, and people Google recipes all the time.\n\nWe argued. I told her, “I’m not the recipe police, but I’m not sending any more of yiayia’s recipes, especially the holiday ones.” I also asked her to remove the paid class for the two specific dishes that were straight from my yiayia’s book. She refused. My brother called me saying they’re trying to save for IVF, the extra income matters, and I’m being selfish. My mom hates conflict and told me to “just let it go—it’s only food” and to send Tara the rest so “everyone can enjoy them.”\n\nI said no. I blocked Tara from seeing my cooking stories and told the family that, moving forward, I’m happy to cook for everyone, I’ll share my own spins, but I’m not sending out PDFs of the originals anymore.\n\nNow I’m “the difficult one” and my brother says I’m punishing them when they’re trying to build a family. I feel awful about the IVF part, but also… this isn’t about money to me. It’s about respect. If she’d credited yiayia and not paywalled the exact recipes I typed in a private family chat, I wouldn’t be this mad.\n\nAITA for refusing to give her more recipes and asking her not to monetize the holiday ones?\n\nEdit for clarity:\n- I don’t think I “own” Greek food. I’m annoyed she paywalled my yiayia’s exact measurements/techniques I shared privately.\n- I offered to help her develop her own versions on camera and thought we could do a “cook with me” collab where we talk about my yiayia. She declined, said “solo videos perform better.”\n- The two holiday dishes were explicitly things my yiayia only made for family gatherings. It’s not legally binding, but it mattered to her.\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for putting a keypad lock on my bedroom after my MIL kept “borrowing” my clothes and makeup whenever she stayed with us?\nself_text: I (30F) and my husband (33M) host his mom (60s) one weekend a month because she lives a few hours away and likes to visit her friends here. We have a small house with a proper guest room and bath. I genuinely want her to feel welcome, so I set up a guest basket with toiletries (full-size shampoo/conditioner/body wash, toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, etc.), extra towels, and even a spare phone charger.\n\nThe problem: every visit, she “borrows” my stuff. At first it was a mascara and some face cream. Then I noticed missing lipsticks, my heat protectant half gone, and a blouse of mine showed up in her suitcase “by accident.” She’s also worn my white blazer to brunch without asking (I found it later with foundation on the collar), and once I came home to her in my slippers and one of my knit sweaters because she “got chilly” when we were out.\n\nI’ve brought it up calmly multiple times. I said, “I don’t mind sharing in a pinch—please just ask first and put things back where you found them.” She smiled, said of course, then did it again. My husband backed me up and reminded her to use the guest basket, and even bought her a little toiletry kit to keep here. She tells us “we’re family, we share” and that I’m being “uptight about things.”\n\nLast visit was the last straw. I had an early client meeting Monday and set out my makeup and a silk shirt Sunday night. Monday morning, half my makeup was moved/used and the shirt was gone. MIL had worn it to sleep because “it was soft.” I was late scrambling to find something else ironed.\n\nSo before her visit this weekend, I installed a keypad lock on our bedroom door (like $35 from Amazon). The rest of the house is totally open to her: guest room, guest bath, kitchen, laundry—everything. It’s literally just our bedroom/closet now locked.\n\nShe arrived, went to take a “quick shower and freshen up,” tried our bedroom, found it locked, and got icy. She asked for the code, I said, “We’ve set up the guest room with everything you need—let me know if you’re missing anything.” She said I was accusing her of stealing, called it “humiliating,” and told my husband she felt unwelcome. She left the next morning to stay with a friend and later texted him that I’m “territorial” and “not ready for a real family.”\n\nNow his aunt and sister are chiming in that “locks are for thieves” and that I “should have talked to her again” instead of “locking her out like a teenager.” My husband is torn—he acknowledges the boundary issues and that he’s tired of playing referee, but says putting a lock on our bedroom “might have been extreme” without one more sit-down.\n\nFrom my side: We did talk. Several times. I tried stocking a guest kit. I don’t want to police my own bedroom every visit. The lock is the only way I can relax and not worry about my clothes/makeup disappearing or being worn without asking.\n\nAITA for putting a keypad lock on our bedroom after repeated boundary issues?\n\nEdit: The guest room closet is fully available to her with hangers and a small set of drawers. The lock is only on our bedroom (where my closet/vanity are). I also added labeled guest toiletries (including new makeup remover, hair ties, brush, deodorant, etc.). If she truly needs something, I’m happy to grab it for her—just not okay with the help-yourself approach.\n\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for telling my dad to stop “borrowing” from my emergency fund and moving it to a different bank?\nself_text: I’m 20F, live at home while going to community college and working part-time. My dad (47M) is big on “money lessons” and has been pushing me to build an emergency fund since I got my first job. I’ve been super disciplined and managed to save about $2,800 over the last year.\n\nHere’s the issue: over the last few months, my dad has started treating my emergency fund like the family “float.” It started with him asking to borrow $100 “just for two days” when our fridge died and they needed cash for a used one. Then it was $60 for gas because payday was Monday. Then $180 for a car battery for my mom’s van. Each time he swore he’d pay it back the next week.\n\nHe’s paid some of it back in drips and drabs, but not all, and the “two days” has turned into weeks. When I brought it up, he said “this is how families work” and that I should feel proud my savings could help in a pinch. I told him my emergency fund is for my emergencies (car repair, medical, losing hours at work), not general household expenses.\n\nFor context: I pay $200/month “rent,” buy most of my own food, pay my own phone bill and gas, and cover my car insurance. I also babysit my younger brother sometimes so they can both work.\n\nLast week he asked again to “borrow” $150 because “groceries are crazy.” I said no and told him I moved my emergency fund to a high-yield savings at a different bank so it’s not linked to my checking (which he can see on our shared credit union app). He blew up and called me ungrateful, said he taught me how to save and now I’m hoarding money while the family struggles. My mom is caught in the middle but basically said I should “help out when asked” because I still live under their roof.\n\nI told them I will help with notice (I can pick up extra shifts, bring groceries, etc.), but I’m done being the household ATM. Dad is giving me the silent treatment and told my aunt I’m “selfish and money-obsessed.”\n\nAITA for moving my money and refusing to let him borrow anymore?\n\nEdit: I’m not cutting them off entirely. I offered to increase my $200 if they need something consistent, I just won’t do random cash “loans” from my emergency fund anymore. Also, I didn’t hide the new account—I told him I moved it after the last request.\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for refusing to dog-sit my sister’s reactive dog over Thanksgiving?\nself_text: I (29F) have two indoor cats and live in a small one-bedroom apartment. My sister “Kate” (33F) has a 90lb rescue (shepherd mix) who is sweet with her but has a bite history with strangers and has gone after small animals before. He’s not crate trained and doesn’t do well in new environments.  Kate and her husband are flying to his parents for Thanksgiving. His family won’t allow the dog at the house (understandable, they have toddlers), and the boarder/trainer Kate usually uses is booked. She told me she “needs” me to take the dog for 5 days since I’m “the only family she trusts.”  I told her no for a few reasons:  - My cats. He fixates on cats; he’s pulled her down to chase neighborhood strays before. I physically cannot separate everyone safely in my place for 5 days.  - Landlord. Our lease explicitly bans “animals with known aggression issues” and I had to pay a big pet deposit for my cats. If anything happens, I could lose my housing.  - Work. I can’t be home all day to rotate animals/keep eyes on everyone and he can’t be left alone loose in my apartment.  I offered alternatives:  - I’d split the cost 50/50 for a different reputable boarder that still has openings (it’s pricey because of the holiday).  - I’d do drop-in visits to her place if she hired a trainer/handler to handle the dog for real walks (I’d just do feed/water/checks).  - I could take him for a few hours at a time at her house before/after work so he’s not alone all day, but not full-time at my place.  She told me I’m heartless and “chose your cats over family.” She keeps saying he’s “a big baby” with her and that I’m overreacting because “it was just a nip” (the bite sent her neighbor for stitches last year and animal control was involved). She also said because I’ve babysat her kids overnight, I should be willing to watch her dog “the same way.”  Our mom is staying out of it, but Kate is blowing up the family chat calling me selfish and threatening to skip the trip, which is apparently “ruining” Thanksgiving with the in-laws. Now I’m getting guilt texts about how I “know how much anxiety she has about boarding him.”  I feel bad, but I don’t think I’m equipped to safely manage a reactive 90lb dog around my cats in a tiny apartment (and I did offer to help/pay). AITA for saying no?  Edit for clarity: Dog has a bite history (to a human hand through a fence; required stitches). He also killed a rabbit on a leash last spring. He’s muzzle-trained but only tolerates it for short periods and screams/chews at it if unattended. No crate, no x-pen, and he can clear baby gates. I suggested she ask her vet for holiday boarding or a medical boarding option—she says it’s “too expensive” and doesn’t want him kenneled.\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for asking my brother and SIL to split an Airbnb instead of staying with us for a week with their newborn?\n self_text: I (30F) live in a small 2BR apartment in a city with my husband (32M). The second bedroom is my WFH office. My brother (28M) and his wife (29F) just had a baby 3 months ago and want to come into the city in December to “do the holiday thing” and see family/friends. They asked to stay with us for a full week.\n\nWe hosted them for a weekend in September when the baby was a few weeks old and it was rough. The baby is colicky, they run a loud white-noise machine, and they do contact naps through the day plus feeds every 2–3 hours at night. They also brought a bottle sterilizer, drying rack, cooler bags, a stroller that basically takes up our hallway, and asked me to clear a shelf in the fridge and freezer. That weekend I moved my office into our bedroom and did Zooms from the closet so I wouldn’t wake the baby. My husband works rotating nights twice a week, so he was basically a zombie.\n\nOur building is old with thin walls and has quiet hours after 10pm. Our neighbors already complained once about the crying and footsteps at 1am when my brother was pacing with the baby during their last stay. On top of that, we have a cat and my SIL says scented litter “flares the baby’s skin,” so she asked if I’d switch litter, keep the cat out of the living room entirely, and deep-clean carpets before they arrive. I’m not trying to be difficult but that’s a lot to manage for a week around my job, my husband’s schedule, and holiday stuff we already have booked.\n\nI suggested we split a nearby Airbnb for 4 or 5 nights (I even offered to cover more than half since the city is pricey), and they could still spend all day/evenings with us. They got offended and said “family helps family,” that “it’s one week,” and accused me of being anti-baby/unsupportive. My mom took their side and said I’m prioritizing my cat and “Zoom calls” over being an aunt. For context, our parents live 45 minutes away but have a tiny place without space for a travel crib.\n\nI genuinely want to see them and the baby, I just can’t do another sleep-deprived week of tiptoeing and rearranging my life in a small apartment. I thought the Airbnb was a fair compromise (they still get to come, we still host meals, I still help during the day), but now I’m getting guilt texts about how “we’ll remember who showed up for us.”\n\nAITA for drawing this line and asking to split an Airbnb instead of having them stay with us?\n\nEdit: During the September weekend, I had a panic attack on day 2 after getting up for a 5:30am feed “assist” and then logging onto work at 8. I’m not proud of that, but it’s part of why I’m trying to plan better this time.\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for telling my brother he can’t bring his dog to Thanksgiving unless he pays for a handler?\n self_text: I (30F) am hosting my family’s Thanksgiving for the first time. It’ll be 12 people, including my toddler, my sister’s newborn, and my wife (31F), who has mild dog allergies. My brother (27M) has an 80lb rescue with pretty serious separation anxiety. He refuses to board or crate him, ever.\n\nLast time he brought the dog over, the dog bolted past us through the baby gate, jumped on my counters, ate half a rotisserie chicken, peed on the rug, and scratched our hardwood trying to chase our cat (who lives here and hides when the dog visits). Brother said we needed to “relax so the dog can acclimate.”\n\nI texted everyone basic house rules for the day (no outside shoes in the living room, bring whatever you signed up to cook, and—because of the above—no dogs inside). I offered my brother three options:\n- Board the dog for the day (I even offered to pay half).\n- Come for dessert after his dog’s long walk/dog park time if he can’t be gone long.\n- If he insists on bringing the dog, he can keep him leashed in the fenced backyard and pay for a professional handler/sitter to be there with the dog the whole time (quoted $120 for the afternoon), or agree in writing to cover any damage/cleaning if the dog comes inside.\n\nHe flipped, told my parents I’m “charging admission for family” and “hate his dog.” My parents want me to be “flexible” because “it’s the holidays.” For context: it’ll be ~55°F, we’d set up shade/water if the dog is outside, and no one would leave him unattended. My wife’s allergies + the cat + the toddler/newborn chaos make me feel like this is the fairest compromise.\n\nBrother says I’m an AH for “putting a price on family” and that I’m discriminating against rescues with anxiety. I don’t hate his dog; I just don’t want a repeat of last time or to medicate my wife so he can avoid boarding.\n\nAITA for saying no dog inside, or dog only with a handler he pays for?\n\nEdit for clarity: We’ve tried “just keep him on leash” indoors—brother doesn’t enforce it, and I’m not going to police his dog while cooking for 12. Also, yes, we already hired carpet cleaning after the last incident, which is part of why I proposed the handler/damages agreement.\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for refusing to be my sister’s bridesmaid unless she pays back the wedding deposit she used?\nself_text: I (29F) was supposed to get married this past spring. Two months before, I had a medical issue that meant we had to postpone. Our venue wouldn’t refund our $3,200 deposit but said they’d allow a one-time transfer to a family member if we couldn’t reschedule within 12 months.\n\nMy sister “Lena” (26F) got engaged shortly after and asked if she could take my date/booking so she wouldn’t have to scramble for a venue. I said yes on two conditions:\n1) She would reimburse me the $3,200 deposit, or\n2) If I rebooked within the next 18 months, she’d transfer the deposit back to me/credit me.\n\nWe didn’t do a formal contract (I know, dumb), but we have texts where she says “of course I’ll pay you back, I wouldn’t screw you over.” She used the venue/date, had a lovely engagement party there, and her wedding is in January.\n\nI’ve since recovered and my fiancé and I are planning a smaller wedding for next fall. I asked Lena if we could do the “transfer back” or if she could reimburse me now since she used the deposit. She told me the deposit “became part of their total” and she can’t just “pull money out of nowhere,” and that “family helps family.”\n\nI told her I would not be able to be a bridesmaid or host/pay for the shower if I was out $3,200 that we need for our own wedding. She flipped and said I was “ransom’ing” my role and making her big day about money. My parents think I should suck it up because “Lena finally found something that makes her happy” and they offered to cover half if I’d drop it. I declined because (a) we already paid the deposit, and (b) it was Lena’s promise.\n\nNow I’m getting messages from cousins saying I’m jeopardizing my relationship with my sister over a “technicality” and I can “just scale my wedding down a bit more.” My fiancé is 100% on my side and thinks I should step down completely and send a polite note that we can’t participate until it’s resolved.\n\nAITA for refusing to be a bridesmaid/host anything unless she pays the deposit back or transfers it back to me?\n\nEdit for clarity:\n- Amount: $3,200 deposit (I paid it on my card; receipts/texts confirm).\n- Venue allowed an immediate one-time transfer to a family member; they don’t do partial credits later, so it’s either (a) she reimburses me, or (b) she transfers a new booking back to me. She chose to apply my deposit to her total bill.\n- I offered a payment plan (6 months) and even suggested my parents hold the money so it didn’t get “lost in the wedding shuffle.” She said that was “controlling.”\n- I’m not asking to “profit”—just not to lose my deposit entirely.\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for telling my brother he can’t bring his dog to Thanksgiving at my place?\n self_text: I (29F) am hosting Thanksgiving for the first time with my husband (31M). We rent a small townhouse and have a 2.5yo daughter who is extremely wary of dogs. My brother (26M) has a 4yo rescue who is sweet with adults but very reactive around kids. He’s done training, but “management” is the plan (leash, crate, distance, etc.).  We were all at my parents’ house over the summer and his dog lunged when my daughter squealed and ran. No bite, but it scared her (and me) badly. Since then, she screams if a dog gets too close at the park.  When I sent out a group text with the plan (I’m cooking, everyone bring a side), I added “no pets please.” My lease also explicitly says no animals, and I don’t want to risk it with the property manager since neighbors are nosy.  My brother called immediately and said the dog is “family” and they don’t do holidays without him. He suggested crating the dog in our basement or backyard. Basement won’t work (no door/ventilation, toddler can open the baby gate), and backyard is shared, unfenced, and it’ll be cold—also still a lease violation. I offered to:  - Pay for boarding for the day (I’d cover the whole cost)  - Move the dinner to my parents’ house if they’ll host instead  - Do a second “Thanksgiving 2.0” at my parents’ place the next day where the dog is welcome  He said I was “excluding” his girlfriend (24F) too, because she gets anxiety boarding the dog and won’t come without him. He also said I’m being dramatic about the lease and that “no one will know.” My husband is allergic, which isn’t life-or-death but he does get hives if a dog rubs on furniture.  My parents are telling me to be flexible because “it’s just one day” and that my brother “doesn’t have anyone else” to watch the dog. I get that he loves him, but I’m not comfortable risking:  - My daughter melting down/being terrified in her own house  - The dog reacting again in a crowded, food-heavy, kid-chaotic environment  - Getting in trouble with my landlord  I told him if the dog comes, I’ll cancel hosting and they can all go to my parents’. Now my brother is calling me heartless and my mom says I’m “making this a power thing.”  AITA for standing firm on no dog at my house, even on a holiday?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for not giving my dad a spare key to my new house and changing the locks?\n self_text: I (26F) just closed on my first home two months ago. It’s a small townhouse and I’m ridiculously proud of it. My fiancé (28M) and I are doing some DIY projects on weekends, nothing major.  My dad (52M) helped me with a $10k loan for closing costs. It’s in writing that it’s a loan with a repayment schedule; he insisted on calling it “help,” but it’s not a gift.  Here’s the issue: he’s asked for a spare key “for emergencies.” Growing up, if my dad had a key to anywhere I lived, he used it—often. When I was in college he’d “drop by” my apartment to leave groceries and would also rearrange things, tidy my closet, and once I came home to him painting a wall I hadn’t asked him to paint. Later, at a different apartment, he had a key to water my plants while I was on vacation and then kept using it to let himself in whenever. He isn’t malicious; he just has no sense of boundaries.  I told him I’m not comfortable giving out a spare key. I said I’m happy to add him as an emergency contact with the alarm company and keep a key in a lockbox on-site he can access if I specifically give him the code during an actual emergency. He took it as a personal insult and kept saying, “I’m your father, I helped you buy this house, I need a key in case something happens.”  Last week while I was at work, he called me and said he was at my house “grabbing the ladder he left in my garage.” I never agreed to store his ladder. He said he’d just call a locksmith because “the garage and house are connected anyway.” I told him absolutely not, do not call a locksmith. He hung up on me.  My neighbor texted me a few minutes later that a locksmith van was outside. I left work, drove home, and by the time I got there my dad was in my garage going through my shelving “making space” for his stuff. I lost it. I told the locksmith to stop and leave (he hadn’t rekeyed anything yet). I told my dad he needed to leave immediately and that what he did was not okay. He told me I was being dramatic and ungrateful and “this is why parents get a key.”  I changed all the locks that night and set up a doorbell camera. I told my dad he’s not welcome to enter my home without my explicit permission and that if he tries this again I’ll call the police. Now my mom (divorced from my dad) says I’m escalating and “humiliating” him when he just wants to help. My sister says I should give him a key but “set rules,” because “he’s not going to break in again.”  My fiancé is 100% on my side and thinks we should stick to the lockbox-for-true-emergencies idea. My dad says that since he “helped” with the house, he deserves a key and that I’m treating him like a criminal.  AITA for refusing to give my dad a key and changing the locks after the locksmith stunt?  Edit for clarity: - The $10k is a loan with a written repayment plan and interest. He specifically didn’t want it to be a gift for “tax reasons.” - The townhome HOA has rules about storing items in the garage—nothing from non-residents. I didn’t agree to the ladder or any storage. - I would absolutely share a code with him in a real emergency (wellness check, burst pipe, etc.). I just don’t want him to have ongoing access. \n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for asking my MIL to leave her dog at home for Thanksgiving?\nself_text: I (33F) am hosting Thanksgiving for the first time this year. It’s going to be about 12 people: my side, my husband’s (35M) side, and our friends who don’t have family nearby. We have a small house and a very active 2-year-old.\n\nMy MIL (62F) has a 90lb lab who she takes everywhere. He’s sweet but… he’s a lot. He counter-surfs, begs, jumps when excited, and has knocked over my daughter before (no injuries, but it scared her and she cried for a while). At MIL’s house we deal with it because it’s her home. In ours, it’s chaos. Also, my sister (29F) is pregnant and has a mild dog allergy; she gets itchy eyes and congestion.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I called MIL and as nicely as I could asked if she could leave the dog home for Thanksgiving. I told her it’s mainly about safety for our toddler, the small space, and my sister’s allergy. I offered to pay for a doggy daycare/boarding for the day or to arrange/pay for a dog walker to come by multiple times. I even said we could time dinner earlier so they wouldn’t be away as long.\n\nMIL got very upset and said “he’s family” and she doesn’t go anywhere without him. She said I’m being controlling and “anti-dog” (we are not; we just don’t have one). She also said my sister could “take a Claritin” and my toddler “needs to learn to be around animals.” I repeated that I’m happy to cover any boarding/walker costs so it’s not a burden.\n\nShe told my husband later that if the dog isn’t welcome, she isn’t coming either. My FIL and BIL are now “on the fence” about coming. My husband thinks I should drop it to keep the peace, but I don’t want my daughter stressed, my kitchen raided by a giant dog while I’m juggling hot pans, or my sister wheezing through dinner. We’ve already bought a ton of food and my friends are bringing sides.\n\nI feel like I offered reasonable compromises. Husband says I “made it a hill” and that his mom will take this as a rejection. I say boundaries for our home are reasonable, especially when I offered to pay for alternatives.\n\nAITA for staying firm that the dog can’t come, even if it means MIL doesn’t either?\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for telling my brother I won’t watch his kids for free anymore after he “forgot” to pay me twice?\n self_text: I (27F) am a freelance graphic designer. My brother (34M) and SIL (33F) have two kids (5M and 3F). Back in August they asked if I could watch the kids three afternoons a week (Mon/Wed/Fri, ~2–6pm) because daycare pickup got complicated with their jobs. We agreed on $15/hour. It wasn’t my idea, they offered a rate and I said yes because shifting my schedule a bit was doable and I could use steady income.\n\nFor the first month it was fine. Then in October they were “late” paying me and said they’d make it up the next week. I let it slide. Two weeks later, still no payment, then I see on IG they did a fancy brunch and went to an NFL game. I texted asking about the missed hours and they said money’s tight and they “assumed I’d understand since I’m family” and that “it’s just childcare, not a real job.” That stung.\n\nI reminded them we had a rate and I plan my freelance around those hours. If they can’t afford it, I’m open to reducing days or adjusting the rate temporarily, but I can’t do it free. They got defensive, said I’m nickel-and-diming them and “grandma would have helped without keeping a tally.” Our mom chimed in later that evening saying I should “be there for family” since I “work from home anyway.”\n\nI told them I won’t be coming this week or any week until they pay what they owe (it’s about $720 across missed hours and a shorted payment), and we revisit the schedule/rate like adults. My brother blew up, saying I’m putting them in a bind and I should have given more notice. I said two missed payments was notice.\n\nNow my parents think I’m being cold and “punishing the kids.” I feel bad because I love my niece and nephew, but I also can’t be the default free childcare when they’re choosing to spend on extras.

  "title: AITA for insisting my boyfriend skip his rec-league championship to attend my sister’s wedding?\n self_text: I (26f) am a bridesmaid in my sister’s wedding in early December. My boyfriend “J” (27m) and I have been together 3 years, live together, and he RSVP’d “yes” months ago, booked time off, and got fitted for a suit. My parents paid for his plated dinner and he’s in family photos because he’s considered part of the family at this point.  J plays in a rec soccer league that usually has games on weeknights. Due to rainouts they reshuffled the playoff schedule, and now the championship game landed on the exact date of my sister’s wedding. He’s the team captain and their striker, so he’s really invested and says he’s “earned this shot” after years of playing.  The wedding is 2 hours away from our city. Rehearsal/dinner is Friday night, hair/makeup/photos start at 8am Saturday, ceremony at 2pm, photos after, reception at 6pm. J suggested he’ll come to the rehearsal, then drive back Saturday morning, play the final (kickoff at 3pm), and “hustle to make the reception by dessert.” He’d miss the ceremony, photos, and most of the reception. He also floated the idea that I just go without him entirely “since I’ll be busy with bridesmaid stuff anyway.”  I told him that’s not acceptable. He already committed, my family paid for his plate, he’s in formal photos, and we’ve built plans around him being there. Also, my sister is pretty hurt that he’s even considering ditching—she’s not a bridezilla, but she did ask specifically that our partners be present all day for pictures and seating. If he no-shows, someone has to shuffle seating and photos last minute, and I’ll be juggling explanations on top of bridesmaid duties.  J says I’m being inflexible and acting like “his hobbies don’t matter.” He says it’s a one-time championship and “just a wedding” that I’ll be busy at anyway. I told him weddings aren’t drop-in events, this is my sister’s, and he made a commitment months ago. He accused me of trying to control him and said I’ll “make him the bad guy with my family” if he chooses the game. I said if he chooses the game, that’s his choice—but I’m not going to cover for him and I think it’s disrespectful.  For what it’s worth, the league offered no reschedule, and his team would still have 10 players if he didn’t go (they usually play 11s with subs). The wedding is non-refundable at this point and seating/timing is finalized.

  "title: AITA for backing out of being a bridesmaid after my friend added a “weight clause” to her wedding?\nself_text: I (28F) was asked to be a bridesmaid for my friend “Kara” (27F). I was excited and said yes in July. We picked a color, not a specific dress yet, and she said she wanted everyone to feel comfortable and “choose your vibe, same palette.”\n\nLast week, Kara sent a Google Doc titled “Bridal Party Expectations.” It had stuff like deadlines for hair/makeup payments, rehearsal time, etc. But there were also new rules that weren’t discussed:\n- Everyone must be within 5lbs of their first fitting weight by the final fitting “to maintain a cohesive silhouette.”\n- No visible tattoos or unconventional hair colors (I have a small wrist tattoo and my hair is dark brown with a subtle copper money piece).\n- Spray tans strongly encouraged “for photos.”\n- Heels minimum 3 inches for ceremony photos “for height continuity.”\n- A “poise pledge” saying we won’t post unflattering photos or videos of ourselves or the bride.\n\nThe “weight clause” set me off. I’m a size 10/12 and pretty stable, but my weight fluctuates a few pounds with my cycle, stress, etc. Kara is tiny and very into fitness. I told her I wasn’t comfortable signing anything about my weight or covering extra alteration costs if my body did what bodies do. She said it’s not about shaming, it’s about “art direction” and “investment in her vision.” She also said if we didn’t sign by Friday we’d be considered resigned and responsible for “our share of costs” already incurred.\n\nI told her I’m stepping down because I don’t want to sign something that monitors my body. I said I’ll still attend the wedding and celebrate her. She flipped and said I blindsided her and am “making it about me.” She sent me a Venmo request for $412: $150 for the “dress deposit” (I never got measured; she ordered a generic size), $80 for shoes she picked (I had not purchased them), $50 for a robe, $32 for a tan appointment deposit (she booked one for me without asking), and $100 “stress fee” for her coordinator’s extra time “to replace a bridesmaid.”\n\nI refused the Venmo and said I’ll pay for the robe if it’s already ordered and personalized, but I’m not paying for things I didn’t agree to (tan, heels) or that were ordered without my measurements or consent (dress). She said all bridesmaids knew weddings are expensive and she “can’t just swallow” my costs.\n\nOur mutual friends are split. Two bridesmaids privately told me they hate the doc but are going along because “it’s one day.” Another said I’m overreacting and should’ve just kept quiet and worn the heels. My boyfriend thinks the clause is controlling and I set a fair boundary.\n\nAITA for backing out and refusing to pay the Venmo request?\n\nEdit to clarify: I happily agreed to pay for hair/makeup/dress originally.

  "title: AITA for canceling Friendsgiving at my place after everyone volunteered my kitchen and time without asking?\n self_text: I (29F) live in a small 1BR with my roommate (28M). We’ve hosted small board game nights, but never a big dinner. Our friend group (10–14 people depending on SOs) usually did Friendsgiving at K’s (30F) house. K moved out of state this year, and in the group chat people started tossing around ideas. I said I could bake a couple pies like last year, and someone replied, “Perfect, we’ll just do it at OP’s since her oven is great.” Then it snowballed.  People started “calling” dishes and also adding “I’ll just throw my green bean casserole in your oven when I get there,” “I’ll need counter space for dough,” “I’ll bring my bird early to brine in your fridge,” “We’ll use your knives/pans right?” Someone even said they’d need a burner for gravy “during plating.” I pointed out my oven can only hold so much, my fridge is tiny, and I don’t have enough seating, plates, or cookware for a full Thanksgiving production line.  I also work retail and have a 5am Black Friday shift the next morning, and my roommate has a certification exam to study for. I told the group I’m happy to:  - Bake two pies and bring them wherever.  - Host a very small potluck capped at 6 people, no oven sharing, everyone brings fully finished dishes and disposable plates/utensils.  - Pitch in for renting the building’s community room for a few hours (has bigger kitchen) if everyone splits the fee.  Immediately I got a bunch of pushback. “We’ve always cooked together, that’s the point,” “It’s not that deep, we’ll clean,” “You hosted game night with 10 people just fine,” (game night = pizza boxes), and “Don’t be controlling.” For context, the last time a few of them “cleaned” after a nacho night, I found dried cheese on my rug two days later and a pan “soaking” for a week.  I reiterated the boundary: tiny kitchen, no space, no time. They kept planning around me anyway. Then on Saturday, B (31M) texted “dropping the turkey at yours at 7am Monday so it can start brining—k thx.” I replied “No. Please don’t come by. I cannot store a turkey.” Monday, I woke up to a cooler on my doormat with a 14lb turkey and a bag of ice. I took it back down to B’s car (he lives one block over and was still parked out front) and put it in his trunk, texted the group chat: “I’m not hosting. Please make other arrangements. I’m still happy to bring pies wherever you land.” I also flipped the top deadbolt that only I and my roommate have keys for.  Now it’s a whole thing. I’m being called selfish and “gatekeeping the holiday,” and a couple friends said I “set a trap” by not hosting but waiting until ‘last minute’ to say no (I brought up limits two weeks ago, and repeated them multiple times when they kept planning). K (out of state) chimed in that “the point of Friendsgiving is making it work together” and said I ruined the vibe. Two people apologized for overstepping, but others are still mad and calling me an AH for “canceling on everyone” and “touching someone else’s food.”  AITA for canceling and returning the turkey instead of just sucking it up and letting them use my place/kitchen?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for refusing to watch my sister’s dog over Thanksgiving even though I WFH?\n self_text: I (29F) work from home in a 450 sq ft studio with two cats. My sister (33F) and BIL booked a last-minute Thanksgiving trip and asked me to watch their 85lb husky mix for five days “since I’m home anyway.”  Her dog is not crate trained, has resource guarding issues (has nipped before over a bone), howls when left, and is on a raw diet that needs freezer space (which I don’t have). He also has a high prey drive and has chased my cats before when she brought him over for a quick visit. My lease has a 40lb weight limit and my cats are the only registered pets; adding another animal—even temporarily—violates my lease and could cost me my pet deposit or more if there’s damage/noise complaints.  I told my sister I can’t host him here, but I offered alternatives: - I can go to her house twice a day for long walks/feeds (she’s 20 minutes away). - I can stay overnight one or two of the days if they set up their guest room for me. - I can split the cost of an insured, reviewed boarder or a professional in-home sitter.  She said that’s “overcomplicating it,” I’m “home all day so it’s easy,” and offered me $100 total for the five days. I said no because it’s not about the money; it’s my cats’ safety, my lease, and the dog’s needs. She told me I “owe” her because she stayed with me for three days after I had my wisdom teeth out last year (I paid her for that, plus groceries).  My mom and one aunt are now calling me selfish and saying “it’s just a dog—keep your cats in the bathroom.” My building is super quiet and I’ve already had one noise warning (for an unrelated party next door that got pinned on my unit until it was sorted out). I’m terrified of him howling all day, my cats getting hurt, or him damaging something and me being on the hook.  I stuck to my no and reiterated my offers to help at her place or pay for a sitter. She texted, “We’ll just bring him over Wednesday morning, you’ll see he’s fine,” which feels like she’s planning to force the issue. I told her I won’t open the door and I’ll let the front desk know I’m not expecting guests. Now the family group chat is blowing up about how “ungrateful” I am and how I’m “ruining their one vacation.”  AITA for refusing and setting a hard boundary even if it means they might have to cancel?  Edit for info: - My building requires pet registration and proof of vaccines; her dog’s shots are overdue (found that out when I asked for records to check a boarder). - He has chased my cats before and snapped at one when she hissed. - I’m not anti-dog; we grew up with dogs. This specific dog’s needs don’t fit my space or lease. - I offered to cover half of a reputable sitter and do drop-ins too. She refuses to have anyone “strangers” in her house but is fine dropping him in my studio.\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",

My husband (34M) and I have a 2yo who has a confirmed dog allergy (hives and wheezing; we have an inhaler and EpiPen). My sister (29F) adopted a rescue last year and brings him everywhere. She calls him her “emotional support animal,” but he’s not a trained service dog.\n\nWe had her over for brunch a month ago, and even after vacuuming and air purifiers, my son broke out in hives and started coughing about an hour after the dog came in. We ended up at urgent care. The allergist told us to avoid indoor dog exposure as much as possible.\n\nI told my sister we’re excited to have everyone but that her dog can’t come inside on Thanksgiving. I offered options—helping pay for a dog walker, covering a day of boarding, or we could swap houses another time so she can host with the dog. She said that’s “cruel,” that her dog goes where she goes, and that he’s “hypoallergenic” (our allergist said that’s not a thing for dander). She suggested we “just give the kid Benadryl” or “keep the windows open” (it’ll be 35°F) or “put him in the playpen in a different room.” I said no—my kid shouldn’t be confined in his own home so a dog can be comfortable.\n\nShe told my mom I’m making her choose between family and her ESA. Now my mom is suggesting compromises like “keeping the dog in the garage/basement.” We have an open floor plan—no doors to isolate a space—and dander still spreads. Also, I’m not sticking a dog in a cold garage for hours.\n\nSister says if the dog isn’t welcome, she’s not coming. My other siblings think I’m being “controlling” and should “be flexible because it’s just one day.” My husband is on my side and said our kid’s health comes first. I feel like I set a reasonable boundary with alternative solutions. AITA for keeping a no-dogs rule for Thanksgiving?\n\nEdit: We do have a fenced yard, but it’ll be too cold/wet to leave a dog outside for 6+ hours, and I wouldn’t be okay with that anyway. The dog staying in the car is obviously a no. I also offered to move Thanksgiving to my mom’s house so my sister could bring the dog there, but my mom said she doesn’t want to host last-minute.\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for asking my roommate to put her boyfriend on the lease or stop basically living here?\n self_text: Me (27F), my roommate “Lena” (26F), and her boyfriend “Kyle” (28M) live in a 2 bed/1 bath apartment in a pricey city. When Lena and I signed the lease in June, we agreed on house rules, including a “no more than 2 overnights per week per guest” rule, advance notice for the second night, and that we’d revisit if a partner started all-but-living here.\n\nFor the last three months, Kyle has stayed over 5–6 nights a week. He has toiletries in the bathroom, uses our kitchen daily, showers here every morning before work, and he and Lena game in the living room until after midnight most nights. He eats meals here (often ones I cooked for both of us before this became a thing), and he’s started leaving laundry baskets in the hallway because “it’s easier.” I also recently learned Lena gave him a copy of our key without asking me.\n\nOur utilities have jumped and I upgraded our internet tier (at Lena’s request because his gaming kept lagging). I’ve also been buying household stuff more often (paper towels, TP, dish soap), and our water/electric bills went up noticeably.\n\nI had a calm, written-then-in-person conversation with Lena where I laid out options: either (1) we talk to the landlord about officially adding Kyle to the lease and split rent/utilities three ways, or (2) if she insists he’s still just a guest, we set a cap of 2 nights/week or she pays a flat $150/month “guest share” to cover increased utilities/consumables, plus he helps with chores and we agree on quiet hours. I said I’m not trying to police her relationship, I just want fairness and sleep.\n\nShe blew up and said I’m controlling, “making our home transactional,” and trying to “ban” her boyfriend. She claims he’s not living here, just sleeping over, and that he “can’t afford” to be on the lease. She also said if I push this, she’ll move out and I’ll be “stuck” with the apartment.\n\nI don’t want to lose a roommate or be a jerk, but I also don’t think it’s reasonable to subsidize a third adult who is here almost every night and using our space like a resident. AITA for setting this boundary and giving those two options?\n\nEdit for clarity:\n- Our lease allows an additional occupant with landlord approval, background check, a $50/month rent bump, and a small deposit increase. I confirmed this with the property manager.\n- The $150 figure roughly offsets the internet upgrade (+$20), average water/electric increase (last 3 months +$60ish combined), and shared supplies I’ve been replacing more often.\n- I’m not trying to kick Kyle out; I just want either an official third roommate or a real guest policy we stick to.\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for telling my sister I won’t watch her dog anymore after it lunged at my 7-week-old’s bassinet?\n self_text: I (29F) just had my first baby 7 weeks ago. My sister (26F) has a 2-year-old rescue mix who is very high-energy and has a history of leash reactivity (no bites, but lots of lunging/barking at dogs/people). In September, her apartment started renovations and she asked if I could keep her dog “for a week or two” while she stayed with her boyfriend. I said yes because I was still pregnant and figured it would be short-term.\n\nFast forward: baby arrived early, renovations ran long, and this has turned into 6 weeks of me managing a newborn and a 60lb anxious dog. I’ve tried to make it work. I crate him for naps, do two long walks (my husband helps when he’s home), use baby gates to keep him out of the nursery, and give him puzzle feeders. He’s not a bad dog, just… a lot.\n\nThe incident: Two days ago, baby started wailing while I was warming a bottle. The dog bolted from the living room into the hallway, jumped up on the bassinet stand (on wheels), and pawed at the mesh. He didn’t bite and it looked more like frantic excitement/threshold overload than aggression, but he shoved the bassinet enough that it rolled and kind of wobbled. Baby is fine (I grabbed the bassinet immediately), but I was shaking afterward. Between sleep deprivation and postpartum anxiety, that was my last straw.\n\nI called my sister and told her she needed to pick up the dog and find other arrangements (boarding, her BF, friends, whatever). I even offered to pay for two weeks of boarding to help bridge the gap. She flipped out and said I was “punishing” her dog for being curious, that “he’s family,” and that I “promised.” She said I’m being dramatic and anti-dog now that I have a baby. Our mom is on her side, saying I knew what I signed up for and it’s “only a few more weeks.” My husband thinks I was more than generous and that we should have ended this weeks ago.\n\nFor context: Sister sees the dog maybe twice a week for walks but hasn’t taken him overnight once since renovations started. She keeps bringing up that she covered my portion of rent for one month in college (years ago) and helped plan my bridal shower, so I should “repay” her by sticking it out. I said I’m not comfortable anymore and my baby’s safety/stress level comes first.\n\nAITA for drawing the line and refusing to keep her dog any longer, even with me offering to pay for boarding?\n\nEdit for clarity:\n- Baby is never left alone with the dog. Gates on nursery and hallway. The bassinet was in the hallway next to the living room; he cleared the gate when he heard the cry.\n- The dog is exercised, crated appropriately, and has a mat spot in the living room. He knows basic obedience but is easily overstimulated.\n- Sister’s BF does allow dogs; she just says his building “frowns on it” and boarding is “too expensive.”\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for asking my husband to skip his tournament finals to be at my graduation?\nself_text: I (29F) am graduating next weekend with my master’s. It’s been a long 3 years of full-time work + night classes and I’m honestly really proud. My parents are flying in (first time they’ve visited in years) and I reserved extra seats months ago assuming my husband (31M) would be there.\n\nHe’s on an amateur esports team (think local/regional league, prize pools vary) and they’ve made it to the finals. The finals got scheduled for the exact same day/time as my ceremony. He didn’t know the date when I first told him about my graduation because the league posts brackets late, but I gave him my date back in August and have been mentioning it off and on ever since.\n\nHe asked if we could “split the day” (he goes to the finals, I go to the ceremony, then we all meet up after for dinner). I told him it’s really important to me that he’s in the audience for the ceremony—my last name will be called, hooding, photos, etc., and this is kind of a once-in-a-lifetime milestone for me. He said this finals could also be a once-in-a-lifetime thing for the team, they’ve worked all season for it, and there’s a chance at $10k split among the roster (so ~$1.6k after taxes for him if they win).\n\nFor context:\n- I’ve gone to a bunch of his matches (when they’re local) and watch the rest on stream. I don’t mind the hobby at all.\n- He missed my undergrad ceremony years ago because we were long distance then and he couldn’t get time off. I didn’t hold it against him and never brought it up again, but this one stings more because we live together and it’s 30 minutes from home.\n- He says I’m “asking him to let the team down” and that “I can just stream the replay of the ceremony later.” I said it’s not about seeing it, it’s about having him there with me.\n\nI told him if he chooses the finals, I won’t go to his future tournaments or rearrange my weekends around them anymore, because it’s clear they rank above my milestones. He said that was an unfair ultimatum and that I’m making him choose between me and “something he’s poured a year into.”\n\nHe says I’m minimizing his passion. I feel like he’s minimizing my achievement. AITA for asking him to skip the finals to attend my graduation?\n\nEdit for clarity:\n- His team does have a sub, but he says using a sub for finals is “basically forfeiting.”\n- The finals are a 2-hour drive away. The timing overlaps directly with my ceremony (no realistic way to do both).\n- I’m not asking him to quit the team or miss the season—just this one event that happens to be the exact same time as my graduation.\nsubreddit: AmItheAsshole",
  "title: AITA for refusing to keep giving my neighbor groceries “until payday”?\n self_text: I (30F) live in a townhouse with shared walls. My neighbor “Kara” (33F) moved in over the summer with her 8-year-old son. We were friendly at first — waved hello, accepted packages for each other, that sort of thing. About a month after she moved in, she knocked and asked to borrow an egg because she was baking and realized she was short. No big deal.\n\nSince then, it’s become constant. It started as eggs, then milk, then flour, then sugar, then butter. Then it turned into “Hey do you have any laundry pods?” then “Can I grab a stick of butter, some garlic, and a little olive oil?” Then it became texts like, “Could I get two chicken breasts? I’ll Venmo you payday!” and her son showing up at my door with a note that says “Mom needs pasta and sauce.” I’ve purchased extra sometimes thinking it would prevent the asks (it didn’t). She always says she’ll pay me back “Friday,” but the only money I’ve ever seen was $5 once (after I reminded her).\n\nI tried to set boundaries nicely. I told her I don’t mind the occasional egg or cup of sugar, but I can’t be their pantry. I suggested a few budget grocery delivery options and even offered to bring her with me on my next Costco run if she wanted to split bulk items. She always says yes in the moment and then… keeps asking to “borrow” my stuff. FWIW I’m not rolling in cash — I budget my meals and shop sales.\n\nThe last straw was last week. I was meal prepping chicken curry for the week and had exactly what I needed. Kara texted that she was “in a bind” and asked if I could spare “some chicken thighs, an onion, and a can of coconut milk.” I told her I couldn’t this time because I needed what I had. Ten minutes later, there’s a knock. It’s her son asking again because “Mom says it’s for dinner.” I felt awful, but I told him gently that I didn’t have extra tonight and to tell his mom I was sorry.\n\nKara then texted me saying I put her in a “really tough spot” and that “neighbors help neighbors.” I reminded her I’ve helped a lot and I’m not her grocery delivery. She got snippy and said she’s a single mom doing her best, and it costs me “basically nothing” to share when I have it. I said it does cost me, actually, and that I’d appreciate it if she stopped sending her son to ask.\n\nTwo days later, I found a passive-aggressive post in our neighborhood Facebook group about how “some people don’t understand community” and “single parents need support not judgment.” A few neighbors commented with generic sympathy, but one messaged me privately and asked if it was about me, and said he’s gotten the same knocks for “borrowing” paper towels and coffee.\n\nI feel like I’ve been more than generous, but I also feel like the bad guy for turning down food when there’s a kid involved.

  "title: WIBTA for asking my husband to skip his best friend’s destination bachelor party?\n self_text: Me (29F) and my husband (31M) are trying to get our finances under control. We have about $7k in medical debt from a surgery I had in the spring, we’re building a small emergency fund, and we’ve been saving for a down payment. We agreed at New Year’s: no trips over $500 this year unless it’s for family emergencies.  His best friend just announced a 4-day destination bachelor party in March (Thursday–Sunday). Flights are currently ~$650 from our city, the shared Airbnb would be $450 per person, the “planned activities” (boat day, ATVs, club table, etc.) add up to ~$400, and then there’s food/drinks/incidentals which I conservatively estimate at $300–400. So we’re looking at ~$1,800–$2,000 minimum.  He’s already in the wedding and we’ve budgeted for that: suit rental ($290), gift ($150), and one local dinner for the guys ($75). That’s fine. My issue is the bachelor trip. If he goes, we’d either need to put parts of it on a credit card (we’ve been trying to stop doing that) or delay some stuff we literally need: new tires before winter and a dental bill we’ve been chipping away at. It would also push our emergency fund goal back by at least two months.  I told him I’m not trying to be controlling and I totally support him celebrating his friend. I suggested he do every local event plus the wedding, and maybe fly in a day early to help the groom with last-minute things as a compromise. He says I’m being unfair because “your friends had their girls’ weekends” (I went to two local one-night stays this year—each under $200 and planned before our budget reset). He also says this is “once in a lifetime” and that his friend would be hurt if he skipped. He floated the idea of “I’ll cover it with a bonus if it comes through,” but that’s not guaranteed and we’ve agreed not to budget on “maybe” money.  He told me if I really feel strongly, he’ll cancel—but he’ll resent me for it, and that it makes me look like I don’t support him. I feel sick about it because I don’t want to be the reason he misses something important, but I also don’t want us backsliding after months of cutting back (we haven’t eaten out, I canceled subscriptions, we sold stuff on FB marketplace, etc.).  WIBTA if I asked him to skip the destination trip and stick to the local events/wedding only?\n subreddit: AmItheAsshole"
