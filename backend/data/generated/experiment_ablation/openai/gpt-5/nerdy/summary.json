  "title: Returning to AE in 2025—what’s the current “stable baseline” for SKSE/engine fixes + lightweight follower/QoL?\n self_text: I’m spinning up a fresh Skyrim AE playthrough (Steam 1.6.1170) and want a rock‑solid, script‑light baseline before I layer in content. Goal: survival‑ish, single‑player, follower‑centric, minimal ENB fuss, stable 100+ hour save. I’m comfortable with LOOT/xEdit/DynDOLOD, and I’d rather use modern frameworks (SPID/OAR/Community Shaders) over legacy solutions.\n\nHardware (if it matters): 5800X3D / 32GB / RTX 4070 / NVMe SSD.\n\nSanity‑check this 2025 base and tell me what’s obsolete, redundant, or missing, please:\n\nFixes/foundations\n- SKSE64 + Address Library (AE)\n- USSEP\n- SSE Engine Fixes (Part 1 + Part 2)\n- powerofthree’s Tweaks\n- Scrambled Bugs\n- Bug Fixes SSE\n- SSE Display Tweaks\n- PrivateProfileRedirector\n- MCM Helper\n- po3 Papyrus Extender\n- Crash Logger (SSE/AE/VR) — replacing .NET Script Framework for AE\n\nModern frameworks/distribution\n- SPID (Spell Perk Item Distributor)\n- KID (Keyword Item Distributor)\n- Base Object Swapper\n\nAnimation/control\n- Open Animation Replacer (OAR)\n- Payload Interpreter\n- Nemesis only if a mod specifically needs it (no FNIS)\n- True Directional Movement + SmoothCam (if they’re still considered stable together on AE)\n\nGraphics/perf\n- Community Shaders (CS) + its core fixes vs a lightweight ENB — is CS the recommended “default” now for a non‑photogrammetry setup?\n\nUI/QoL (lightweight only)\n- SkyUI\n- Better Dialogue Controls / Better MessageBox Controls\n- Quick Loot (RE/EE) that’s AE‑safe\n- Quick Light\n- Notification Log (or similar)\n\nFollowers (big question)\n- What’s the most stable, AE‑friendly follower framework in 2025? NFF vs EFF vs something newer? I want:\n  - Multi‑follower support without heavy scripts/bloat\n  - Simple sandboxing and horse/catch‑up behavior\n  - Good compatibility with SPID‑distributed gear/skills\n- Any “must‑have” lightweight follower QoL (e.g., Simple Offence Suppression, Move it Dammit) that won’t add script lag?\n\nSurvival\n- Prefer SunHelm over CC Survival/Frostfall; any gotchas with AE and fast travel/needs interactions?\n\nAccessibility\n- Any colorblind‑friendly SkyUI/TrueHUD/lockpicking HUD presets you recommend? Looking for good contrast without neon.\n\nOpen to: replacing older fixes if a single modern plugin supersedes them; warnings about redundant combos (e.g., Display Tweaks vs other FPS/limiters); and crash‑log reading tips for AE (any analyzer tools you like).\n\nTarget is <300 plugins, minimal script latency, and zero CTDs in Whiterun. Thanks in advance for a 2025‑era checklist!\n subreddit: skyrimmods",
  "title: Concept: Make the Tower actually social — in‑game LFG plaza with role tags, activity kiosks, and clan stalls\n self_text: Fireteam Finder has been a big step forward, but the Tower still feels like an AFK lobby. What if we turned a section of the Tower into a true social/LFG space that layers on top of Fireteam Finder instead of replacing it?\n\nIdea: “The Plaza”\n- Dedicated area in the Tower with activity kiosks (Raids, Dungeons, GMs, PvP, Seasonal). Stand near a kiosk to auto‑filter open groups to that activity and surface local listings first.\n- Opt‑in role tags that show above your Guardian in the plaza: Sherpa, Learner, Chill, Speed, Triumph, Mic, No Mic, OCE/NA/EU/Asia, Controller/KBM. These tags also prefill Fireteam Finder fields.\n- Clan stalls: rotating spaces where clans can advertise (time zones, activity focus, newbie‑friendly). Walk up, inspect, request to join, or schedule a trial run.\n- Quick‑post boards: 1‑click “Need 1 for GM” or “Teaching Normal Raid” from the plaza; it pushes to Fireteam Finder with your tags and a short note.\n\nSocial + QoL\n- Commendations and Report tied in: highlight Sherpas and high‑commendation players; repeat offenders get deprioritized visibility.\n- Gentle nudges: weekly bounty like “Form a fireteam from the Plaza 3 times” for a small rep boost. Encourages using the space without making it mandatory.\n- Accessibility: colorblind‑safe tag icons, readable contrast, text‑to‑speech for invite notifications, simple emote‑based “Looking” signal.\n- Region/ping awareness: optional region tag (I’m in OCE with 180ms to NA); match within region first, then expand if queue is slow.\n\nAnti‑clutter/performance\n- Soft instance cap (e.g., 16‑24 Guardians) with overflow instances.\n- Idle protections: listings expire if you leave the plaza or go AFK too long.\n- Spam controls: rate‑limit invites, block/mute persists across instances.\n\nWhy this over just menus?\n- It keeps Fireteam Finder’s convenience but adds a reason to exist in the Tower beyond vendors. Social hubs are where MMO memories happen—teaching runs formed in the moment, clans recruiting by vibe, not just a text box.\n\nWould you use this? What tags or kiosks would you want? Anything here you’d hate (e.g., proximity chat) that should stay opt‑in only?\n subreddit: DestinyTheGame",
  "title: AE auto-updated, SKSE plugins failing (versionlib missing) — should I downgrade to 1.6.640 or is 1.6.1170 stable now?\n self_text: Steam auto-updated me to the current AE runtime and a bunch of my SKSE plugins stopped loading. Looking for advice on whether I should fully downgrade back to 1.6.640 for stability, or bite the bullet and update everything to run on the new runtime.\n\nSymptoms:\n- MCM is mostly empty (only SkyUI shows).\n- skse64 logs show SKSE loading, but several plugins fail with “current runtime not supported” or “versionlib-1-6-1170-0.bin not found.”\n- Engine Fixes and Papyrus Extender in particular are hard-failing; a few others silently skip.\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n- Fresh SKSE install for the current Steam AE runtime.\n- Updated Address Library (AE all-in-one), Engine Fixes, Display Tweaks, po3 Tweaks, Papyrus Extender, MCM Helper, Scrambled Bugs, SPID.\n- LOOT pass, quick xEdit check for dirty edits, verified files.\n- Still seeing plugins complain about the versionlib file mismatch.\n\nMy priorities:\n- I don’t care about CC updates; I want a long-lived, stable platform for a heavy single-player modlist.\n- I’m comfortable with depot downgrades and MO2 “Stock Game” style setups if that’s the recommended route.\n\nQuestions:\n1) In 2025, is the latest AE runtime broadly supported by the core SKSE DLLs (Engine Fixes, po3’s stuff, UIExtensions, SPID, Scrambled Bugs), or are most stable lists still targeting 1.6.640?\n2) If downgrading, is “Best of Both Worlds” + Steam depot still the best practice, and any gotchas when using MO2’s Stock Game/Wabbajack stock setups?\n3) Best way to block future Steam updates without breaking SKSE: Steam “only update on launch,” always launching via MO2’s skse64_loader, or is the GOG build still considered the safer option for pinning?\n4) Crash logging: .NET Script Framework is obsolete on AE—what’s the current go-to crash logger on AE?\n5) Is there a current “AE/SE core DLL checklist” I can follow to confirm I’ve got the right builds for my runtime?\n\nEnvironment:\n- Win11, i5-12600K, RTX 3070, 32GB DDR5\n- MO2, LOOT, xEdit, BethINI; ENB off for now\n- Core stack: USSEP, SkyUI, ENB Light, SPID, OAR/AMR, Nemesis\n\nTarget DLLs I need working: Engine Fixes, Address Library, SSE Display Tweaks, po3 Papyrus Extender + Tweaks, Scrambled Bugs, MCM Helper, SPID, po3 KID, UIExtensions.\n\nHappy to post logs if needed—just trying to choose the right direction before I spend the weekend chasing DLL updates.

  "title: AE 1.6.1170 lightweight survival/RP modlist sanity check (midrange PC) — alternatives welcome\n self_text: Goal: A mostly-vanilla-feel survival/ranger RP run that’s stable for 50–100 hours, minimal script load, no ENB, 60 fps target, and easy to maintain. I’m on AE 1.6.1170 and fine with xEdit/Wrye Bash/LOOT. Looking for a sanity check and lighter/cleaner alternatives.\n\nSpecs (targeting 1080p):\n- Ryzen 5 3600, GTX 1660 Super 6GB, 16GB RAM, SSD\n- Fresh install, cleaned CC content, no texture overhauls beyond light stuff\n\nCore stability/QoL (installed):\n- SKSE64 (AE), Address Library (AE)\n- Engine Fixes (AE) part 1+2, SSE Display Tweaks\n- Scrambled Bugs, powerofthree’s Tweaks, Papyrus Tweaks NG\n- po3 Papyrus Extender NG, MCM Helper\n- PrivateProfileRedirector SE, SSE Creation Kit Fixes (for cleaning), Crash Logger SSE NG\n- Better Dialogue Controls, Better MessageBox Controls, QuickLoot RE, SkyUI\n\nGameplay (candidate picks, not all installed yet):\n- Survival/needs: Sunhelm or iNeed NG? I want light scripts, good CC fishing compatibility, and simple warmth system. Opinions on which behaves nicer with AE and has fewer long-term save bakes?\n- Camping/exposure: Campfire + Frostfall (still the king for immersion?) or is Sunhelm-alone sufficient in 2025? Any must-have patches to keep scripts lean? I plan to disable CC Survival Mode entirely.\n- Hunter vibe: Hunterborn (+ Campfire patch), Simple Hunting Overhaul? Anything lighter you recommend that still makes hunting/cooking meaningful without giant patch work?\n- Perks/magic/combat: I’m leaning Simonrim for lightweight balance:\n  - Adamant, Mysticism, Aetherius, Mundus, Pilgrim, Apothecary, Blade & Blunt\n  - Any gotchas with Hunterborn/Sunhelm/Frostfall? Patches I should not miss?\n- Combat AI: Smilodon (lighter) vs Wildcat (heavier)? I value stability/low scripts over flashy features.\n- Followers: Nether’s Follower Framework still the safest bet for AE, or is there an even lighter alternative for a mostly solo run (1 companion max)?\n- UI/immersion: iHUD, A Matter of Time, Simple Favorites Menu, Quick Light SE\n- Distribution/helpers: SPID and KID for lightweight distribution when needed\n\nVisuals/perf:\n- Weathers/lighting: Cathedral Weathers + LUX Orbis interiors (or should I keep interiors vanilla for fewer patches?). Looking for something that “just works” without an ENB.\n- Trees/land: Cathedral Landscapes + Happy Little Trees (or Skyland AIO Lite?). I’m trying to avoid heavy LOD generation this run.\n- LOD: OK to stick with vanilla + xLODGen terrain and Occlusion only? I’d like to skip DynDOLOD for simplicity.\n\nProcess/maintenance:\n- LOOT sorting, cleaning ITMs/UDRs in xEdit where recommended (not touching USSEP/masters).\n- Wrye Bash for leveled list merging (keeping plugin count modest).\n- Comfortable making small conflict patches in xEdit; just trying to avoid giant integration webs.\n\nQuestions:\n1) Sunhelm vs iNeed NG in AE 1.6.1170: which has fewer long-term script headaches and better compatibility with CC Fishing/Frostfall?\n2) Any red flags with Simonrim + Hunterborn + survival stack? Lightweight patch collections you recommend?\n3) Is Smilodon still the best “set-and-forget” combat AI tweak for a low-script survival run?\n4) NFF on AE: still the least-problematic choice for a 1-follower setup, or should I go even simpler?\n5) Must-have AE-safe SKSE plugins I missed that improve stability without changing gameplay?\n6) Any known conflicts with CC content when using Frostfall/Sunhelm that I should preemptively patch or disable?\n\nOpen to swapping out anything for cleaner equivalents.

  "title: NZ GPU upgrade advice: 1080p144 now, 1440p later — 6700 XT vs 3060 Ti vs used 3070, and is my CX550M enough?\n self_text: Hey team, looking for some NZ-specific upgrade advice. Goal is strong 1080p/144Hz right now for shooters and to dabble in 1440p within a year.\n\nCurrent build:\n- CPU: Ryzen 5 3600 (stock)\n- Cooler: Hyper 212 Black\n- Mobo: MSI B450 Tomahawk Max (latest BIOS)\n- RAM: 16 GB (2x8) DDR4-3200 CL16\n- GPU: GTX 1660 Super\n- Storage: 970 EVO 500 GB + 1 TB HDD\n- PSU: Corsair CX550M (2017 grey label)\n- Case: Fractal Meshify C (2x140 front intake, 1x120 rear exhaust)\n- Monitor: 1080p 144 Hz (G-Sync Compatible)\n\nLocation/Budget:\n- Auckland, NZ\n- GPU budget: $600–$800 NZD\n- Can add ~$150 if a PSU upgrade is absolutely necessary\n\nGames/Goals:\n- Destiny 2, Apex, Overwatch, Bannerlord, Total War, Skyrim (modded), No Man’s Sky, RimWorld, Minecraft\n- Priorities: high FPS and good 1% lows in shooters; I don’t need Ultra everything. Would like to try 1440p in RPGs/strategy later.\n- Occasional recording/streaming; NVENC is a nice-to-have, not a must.\n\nShortlist:\n- RX 6700 XT (12 GB) — seems to have the best price/perf in NZ\n- RTX 3060 Ti (8 GB) — DLSS + NVENC, but the 8 GB VRAM worries me long-term\n- Used RTX 3070 (8 GB) — good performance, but power spikes + 8 GB VRAM\n\nQuestions:\n1) For my use case and NZ prices (PB Tech, Computer Lounge, Playtech, Mighty Ape, Trade Me), which of the three is the best buy right now?\n2) Will my CX550M (2017 grey label) comfortably handle a 6700 XT or 3070 with the 3600, or should I budget for an RM650e/RM750e to avoid transient spikes/coil whine issues?\n3) Any NZ-specific gotchas (availability, cooler models to avoid, better AIBs here)?\n4) Would dropping a Ryzen 5 5600 in first (cheap AM4 upgrade) help 1% lows enough at 1080p to be worth doing before the GPU?\n5) If I can stretch to $900–$1,000, is a new RX 7800 XT or used RTX 4070 a smarter “1440p-ready” jump, or is that diminishing returns versus a well-priced 6700 XT?\n\nExtra notes:\n- Fine with undervolting and fan curves.\n- PCIe Gen 3 only on B450—my understanding is the 6700 XT penalty is small; correct?\n- Open to waiting for Black Friday/Boxing Day if that usually hits NZ stock.\n\nThanks in advance!\n subreddit: buildapc",
  "title: Returning to Bannerlord in 2025: Minimal mod combo that actually fixes late‑game kingdom play?\n self_text: Hey all—returning player here who bounced off EA because the late‑game turned into doomstack ping‑pong and shallow kingdom management. I’m a single‑player sandbox/RP enjoyer, comfortable with Harmony/ButterLib/MCM, Vortex, and reading crash logs. I’m looking for a stable, “vanilla+” mod setup that makes ruling a kingdom engaging without bloating the game or nuking saves.\n\nWhat I’m after:\n- Smarter diplomacy and vassal behavior\n- Better garrisons/defense and less map snowball\n- Wars that breathe (cohesion, objectives) instead of endless dogpiles\n- An economy/politics layer with meaningful tradeoffs\n- Minimal content overhauls; prefer lightweight, maintained mods\n\nQuestions:\n1) Version targeting: Is 1.2.x the move right now, or should I park on 1.1.6 for mod stability?\n2) Core picks: Which current, maintained mods are your go‑tos for late‑game improvement (e.g., Diplomacy, Improved Garrisons, RBM AI‑only, Serve as Soldier early, Distinguished Service)? Any 2025 forks to prefer/avoid?\n3) QoL that keeps vanilla flavor: MCM obviously—what else helps kingdom play without snowballing into total overhaul (Banner Kings seems great but maybe too heavy for this run)?\n4) Settings advice: Sliders/toggles that curb snowball without turning wars into stalemates—kingdom decision costs, influence gain, clan party caps, garrison food/wages, rebellion thresholds, etc.\n5) Compatibility/load order: Must‑know conflicts (RBM with Diplomacy? Calradia Expanded Kingdoms with X?), correct library ordering (Harmony/ButterLib/UIExtenderEx), and what’s safe to add/remove mid‑campaign.\n6) Performance: Any of these tank siege/campaign FPS on a midrange rig?\n\nIf you’ve got a curated “vanilla+ kingdom management” Nexus collection you trust, I’d love a pointer.

Or does a modern i7 close the gap enough to justify going Intel?\n2) NZ‑specific: any B650/B650E or Z790 board recommendations that are reliably in stock at PB Tech/Computer Lounge/Mighty Ape with solid VRM, BIOS flashback, 2.5G LAN, Wi‑Fi, and good ARGB/Aura compatibility?\n3) RAM: For AM5, is 6000 MT/s CL30 still the sweet spot? For Intel, would you just grab a 7200–7600 XMP kit and call it done? 32 GB vs 64 GB for modded Bethesda/Total War?\n4) Any gotchas with thermals/noise or power efficiency (small room, NZ power costs) that push the choice one way or the other?\n\nThanks!

  "title: AE stability help: CTD right after Bethesda logo on a lightweight follower/QoL list (SKSE + Address Library up to date)\n self_text: Hey all, trying to put together a small, stable AE playthrough and running into instant CTDs right after the Bethesda logo/new game. Looking for sanity checks and modern best practices.\n\nSetup\n- Platform: Steam Anniversary Edition (current runtime), MO2, LOOT, xEdit\n- Core: USSEP, SKSE64 (matching runtime), Address Library (latest), Engine Fixes (AE build), Scrambled Bugs, powerofthree’s Tweaks, Bug Fixes SSE, SSE Display Tweaks, Crash Logger SSE (po3), Papyrus Extender\n- Hardware: R5 5600, 32 GB RAM, RTX 3060, game on SATA SSD, no ENB\n\nGoal/Mods (lightweight)\n- Followers: Inigo + Lucien (no visual overhauls), their patches\n- Start/QoL: Alternate Start (LAL), QuickLoot EE, Simple Lock-On, SmoothCam, TrueHUD, Immersive Interactions, Open Animation Replacer (OAR), SPID for a couple outfit distributions\n- No combat/AI/world overhauls, minimal textures\n\nProblem\n- New game CTD immediately after Bethesda logo (or when selecting “New” with ASLAL). Crash Logger reports an address relocation failure (REL::ID/Relocation not found), but not the exact plugin.\n- If I disable SKSE plugins, the game boots. Re-enabling in batches points to a combo issue: any set that includes TrueHUD + SmoothCam + Simple Lock-On tends to crash, but each works alone.\n\nWhat I’ve tried\n- Verified runtime/SKSE/Address Library versions match\n- Binary search on SKSE plugins; SKSE log shows expected loads, then “plugin disabled” lines when I toggle\n- LOOT-sorted, followers low, patches after\n- xEdit quick checks: only minor ITMs in tiny QoL patches, no missing masters\n- Fresh MO2 profile and fresh ini, no ENB, no reshade\n\nQuestions\n1) Is there a known AE-era conflict chain between TrueHUD, SmoothCam, Simple Lock-On, and OAR? Recommended plugin load/ini order in 2025?\n2) For Crash Logger “relocation/address” failures, how do you pinpoint the exact SKSE DLL without guessing? Any log flags or tools that map REL IDs to the offending plugin?\n3) What’s your current minimal “stability stack” for AE you consider must-have (Engine Fixes AE, SSE Display Tweaks, Scrambled Bugs, Bug Fixes SSE, po3 Tweaks, etc.)? Anything I should add/remove/replace?\n4) Follower mod best practices on AE: patch ordering with SPID distributions and behavior tweaks—any gotchas specific to AE?\n\nHappy to post full crash log and plugin list if that helps—just wanted to sanity-check approach first.

  "title: Tower 2.0 idea: In‑game LFG terminals, firing range, and shareable “build cards” to cut friction/toxicity\n self_text: I love Destiny but the social friction is still huge for endgame: third‑party LFG, “link raid.report,” build shaming, and zero practice space. Pitch: make the Tower a real MMO hub. Add LFG terminals with smart matchmaking (role tags, mic required, sherpa flag, and regional ping filters for Oceanic), a firing range with programmable boss dummies and modifiers to test DPS and learn rotations, and shareable build cards (auto‑generated from your loadout: subclass, aspects/fragments, weapons, armor mods, stat tiers, artifact perks) you can post on an in‑game board or attach to LFG. Let players set privacy (streamer mode/redact IDs or hide exact rolls) but keep a “verify build” toggle so groups know you can meet checks. Reward sherpas with Tower rep cosmetics and track chill completions to incentivize good behavior. Bake in accessibility: colorblind‑friendly target plates, audio cues, and a “repeat last mechanic” button in the range. Would this reduce LFG toxicity and third‑party reliance, or just move it in‑game? What pitfalls you see (elitism, load times, screen clutter), and how would you tune it so casuals aren’t locked out?\n subreddit: DestinyTheGame",

Aim: high settings at 1440p, 120–165fps where feasible; quiet thermals preferred.\n\nBudget: ~NZD $1,200 for the GPU (flex if worth it). Shopping at PB Tech / Computer Lounge / Mighty Ape.\n\nShortlist:\n- RTX 4070 Super (12GB): strong efficiency, DLSS 3/FG, NVENC, better RT; but 12GB VRAM worries me for modded Bethesda/TW:WH3 down the line.\n- RX 7900 XT (20GB): more raw raster and VRAM; FSR 2/3 support; potentially better long‑term for texture‑heavy games; power draw higher.\n\nQuestions:\n1) For my game mix at 1440p high refresh, which card will feel better over the next 2–3 years? Any Destiny 2/Apex/War Thunder quirks I should know (FSR/DLSS support, driver stability)?\n2) How big is the real‑world upside of DLSS 3 + Frame Gen in Apex/NMS/Skyrim (modded via plugins) versus the extra VRAM headroom on 7900 XT for TW:WH3 and heavy texture modlists?\n3) Anyone hit VRAM ceilings at 1440p with 12GB in modded Skyrim SE or TW:WH3? Is 20GB meaningfully “smoother” for these?\n4) Is my Focus 650W Gold sufficient for a 7900 XT, or should I budget for a 750–850W PSU upgrade?\n5) Meshify C fit: I believe max GPU length is ~315 mm. Any quiet AIB models (both camps) that actually fit under that in NZ stock?\n6) Curveball: would a 5800X3D first be smarter for TW:WH3/Bannerlord/Skyrim CPU‑bound scenarios, then GPU later?

If Bungie wants the game to feel more like a living world (and give us a reason to hang out between activities), what if the Tower became a real social hub with systems that matter?\n\nPitch:\n- Player apartments: Instanced rooms you can decorate with trophies, shaders, title plaques, mannequins showing favorite loadouts, and fish tanks (let me flex my aquarium RNG). Invite-only for privacy, with photo-mode lighting options.\n- LFG kiosks in-world: Physical Fireteam Finder boards near vendors. Post/join runs without opening extra menus. Optional voice/text channels tied to the kiosk, with robust reporting and block tools.\n- Clan halls: Shared spaces unlocked by clan rank—banner displays, weekly buff tokens earned via small clan bounties, a target-dummy range, and a wall of triumphs. Great place for teaching nights.\n- Fashion runway and photobooth: A rotating stage near Eva with weekly community-chosen themes; opt-in showcases, NPC judging, and small cosmetic tokens for participation.\n- Patrol-sized instancing: 12–24 Guardians per Tower shard with lightweight “public events” (target practice contests, Sparrow obstacle courses, vendor mini-jobs). Rewards = tiny, just for fun.\n- Friction killers: Direct queue to playlists from vendor spots, shader preview terminal, loadout lock reminders before you launch, transmat pads to Annex/Helm wings.\n- Accessibility/QoL: Colorblind-friendly signage, on-screen timers for weekly resets/streaks, and a universal “what’s expiring soon” board.\n\nOpen questions:\n- What’s the right balance so F2P players aren’t gated but there’s still cool cosmetics to sell?\n- Any obvious performance issues for last-gen consoles?\n- What social tools would you need (mute-by-default proximity, clan-only instances, etc.) to keep it chill?\n\nWhat would you add or cut to make the Tower somewhere you actually want to be between runs?\n subreddit: DestinyTheGame",

UI/QoL ideas: SkyUI, QuickLoot RE, Yes I’m Sure, Better Dialogue/MessageBox Controls, moreHUD/iHUD, SmoothCam (light preset), Simple Lock‑On? Followers: debating Nether’s Follower Framework vs Simple Follower Extension for lighter overhead; any AE‑safe follower sandbox/horse control picks you recommend? Survival‑lite: SunHelm vs CC Survival + Survival Control Panel—pros/cons for stability and compatibility? I’m fine with Campfire but would like to avoid Frostfall complexity. Combat/AI: looking for light combos like Precision + Valravn (or Wildcat), AI Overhaul (lite or patched), and a dodge solution that won’t spam scripts. World pacing: Timing Is Everything + At Your Own Pace, Immersive Interactions, Simple Horse. Visuals: Cathedral assets for a cohesive look; for lighting, would you choose Lux or ELFX (interiors only) for the fewest headaches on AE? Patching approach: LOOT, xEdit forward edits, minimal Synthesis—are there any “set‑and‑forget” Synthesis patches worth it here?

AFT vs NFF vs SFT (with custom followers)\n self_text: Rebuilding my AE list and trying to lock in a follower framework that won’t melt my save. Goal: 2–3 followers max, basic command wheel or hotkeys, outfit management (no constant re-equipping), sandboxing toggles, and minimal scripts. I run custom followers (Inigo, Lucien, Kaidan 2, Serana Dialogue Add-On) and I’m fine excluding them from management if that’s the best practice. My experience so far: AFT caused CTDs on dismiss/fast travel and some weird sandbox loops; EFF feels abandoned and I’m wary of long-term stability; NFF works but seems heavy in practice (noticed script latency and occasional command delays when changing cells), even after dialing back features. I’m eyeing Simple Follower Tweaks and/or Simple Multiple Followers as a lighter combo, but I’m unsure about current AE compatibility and how well they coexist with SDA/Inigo/Lucien. For those running AE 1.6.1179+ in 2025, what’s your go-to framework for a crash-free, low-overhead setup? If it’s NFF, which MCM features do you disable (monitoring, sandboxing, outfit enforcement, etc.) and which followers do you whitelist/blacklist? Any must-have patches or known conflicts with SDA/Lucien/Kaidan? Bonus points for tips to avoid alias bloat and save bloating (e.g., when to clear followers from the framework, safe outfit rules, horse support that isn’t a script bomb).

Any NZ‑available kits you’d recommend?\n- Platform longevity: would you stick with AM4 + 5800X3D for the next 2–3 years, or take the hit now and move to AM5?\n\nNot planning heavy OC; cooling and airflow are fine.

  "title: AE Whiterun CTDs traced to Immersive Citizens + JK’s Skyrim — keep AI Overhaul only, or is there a modern patch?\n self_text: Hey all, chasing down a stubborn CTD around Whiterun and could use some sanity checks from folks who live in xEdit.\n\nContext:\n- Skyrim AE 1.6.1170 (clean), SKSE64, MO2, LOOT, xEdit, SSE Engine Fixes, Address Library, Crash Logger (meh321), DynDOLOD 3\n- Goal: stable follower/QoL setup with city overhauls (Inigo, Lucien, NFF, RDO, Convenient Horses), prefer to keep JK’s Skyrim\n\nSymptom:\n- Consistent CTD when approaching Whiterun from the south (stables/gate area). Interiors fine. New game (LAL) reproduces.\n\nWhat I tested (binary search):\n- JK’s Skyrim + AI Overhaul only = no crash\n- JK’s Skyrim + Immersive Citizens (I.C.O.) = CTD returns\n- Immersive Citizens alone (no JK’s) = no crash\n- Disabling NFF, Convenient Horses, DynDOLOD/occlusion, and grass mods = CTD persists if JK’s + I.C.O. are both active\n- Load order shuffles (I.C.O. above/below JK’s, with/without available compatibility patches) didn’t help\n\nxEdit notes:\n- Hard NAVM conflicts in Whiterun exterior cells (e.g., WhiterunExterior08/09). Both JK’s and I.C.O. touch navmesh and place statics/markers.\n- I can find maintained patches for JK’s + AI Overhaul, but I’m not seeing a current AE-ready JK’s + Immersive Citizens patch that resolves navmesh in the Whiterun exterior without nuking either mod’s edits.\n\nQuestions:\n1) Is the current best practice simply “pick AI Overhaul OR Immersive Citizens” for city spaces, and if you use JK’s, favor AI Overhaul? (i.e., drop I.C.O. outright)\n2) If someone is successfully running JK’s + Immersive Citizens on AE, what exact patches are you using, and have you had to hand-resolve NAVM in xEdit? Any public patch link I’m missing?\n3) For NFF users alongside AI Overhaul, any recommended settings to avoid package conflicts (e.g., disabling NFF sandbox tweaks) around city gates?\n4) Any known Whiterun-specific gotchas (e.g., certain JK add-ons or “Outskirts” variants) that exacerbate this conflict?\n\nHappy to share a trimmed plugin list if needed, but the isolation above seems pretty conclusive. I don’t mind doing the xEdit work if there’s a documented conflict-resolution path—just don’t want to fight a dead combo if consensus is “don’t mix I.C.O. with JK’s cities.”\n\nThanks!\n subreddit: skyrimmods",
  "title: Returning to Skyrim modding in 2025 — help me modernize my 2019 Oldrim list into a stable AE vanilla‑plus setup\n self_text: After years away I want to rebuild my Skyrim setup from scratch, but this time on SE/AE with a “vanilla‑plus” focus (stable, performant, lore‑friendly, lightweight visuals, modern animation/combat, no NSFW). I’m comfortable with MO2, LOOT, xEdit, Wrye Bash, and basic patching, but I’m not fully up to speed on what’s considered “standard” in 2025. I’d love a sanity check and replacements for outdated mods.\n\nMy specs/targets:\n- Win 11, Ryzen 5 5600, 32 GB RAM, RTX 3060 Ti, NVMe SSD\n- 1440p, 60–90 FPS target, G‑Sync compatible\n- AE installed (all CC content), open to staying on latest or pinning to a stable AE version\n\nGoals:\n- Core bugfix/perf stack first, then vanilla‑plus visuals, modern third‑person combat/animations, survival/QoL, and minimal content additions\n- Prefer SPID/KID/BOS style distribution over patch soup\n- Generate LOD properly (DynDOLOD 3 + TexGen)\n\nPlan (please sanity‑check and suggest swaps):\n- Tools: MO2, LOOT, xEdit, Wrye Bash (for leveled lists), Synthesis (for patchers), BethINI only if needed\n- Core fixes/perf: Unofficial Patch, SSE Engine Fixes, Bug Fixes SSE, Scrambled Bugs, SSE Display Tweaks, powerofthree’s Tweaks, po3 Papyrus Extender, Address Library, Crash Logger (AE)\n- Distribution/framework: SPID, KID, Base Object Swapper\n- Skeleton/physics: XPMSSE; lightweight physics via CBPC for weapons/clothing, add FSMP (Faster HDT‑SMP) only if stable; is that still the safe split?\n- Anim/combat: Open Animation Replacer (OAR), Nemesis, MCO/ADXP, Precision, True Directional Movement, SmoothCam, SCAR (so NPCs use movesets), EVG Conditional Idles\n- AI/encounters: AI Overhaul (or your preferred modern alternative), Encounter Zone Recalculation, Immersive Patrols (if stable), smarter enemy packages that won’t break quests\n- Leveling/survival/immersion: Experience, SunHelm Survival (or use CC Survival if that’s now good?), iNeed NG?, Campfire/CC integration, QuickLoot RE, Better Dialogue/MessageBox Controls, more map markers, better favorites/loadouts\n- Visuals: leaning “Community Shaders” + shader packs for performance instead of ENB; Lux/Lux Orbis for lighting, Cathedral or Azurite Weathers, Cathedral/Skyland/Noble texture families (2K cap where possible), Simple Grass/NGIO if still worth it\n- LOD: TexGen + DynDOLOD 3; xLODGen if I still need terrain/occlusion steps with this setup\n- CC integration: Unofficial CC Content Patches, any recommended “CC integration” mods that blend content into leveled lists/world without bloat\n\nQuestions:\n1) AE versioning: For max compatibility today, should I stay on the latest AE or pin to a specific AE build? Is “Best of Both Worlds/downgrade” still necessary in 2025 or is the ecosystem fully caught up?\n2) Crash/diagnostics: For AE, is Crash Logger + Address Library all I need (i.e., no more .NET Script Framework)? Any newer must‑have logging tools?\n3) Fix stack overlap: Any redundancy/conflicts among Engine Fixes, Bug Fixes SSE, Scrambled Bugs, po3 Tweaks that I should disable specific options for?\n4) Community Shaders vs ENB: For a vanilla‑plus look with strong performance at 1440p, is Community Shaders now the go‑to? Which shader packs are the current “safe” picks that work well with Lux?\n5) Anim/combat stability: Is MCO + Precision + TDM + SCAR considered stable for long playthroughs? Any must‑have compatibility patches or known gotchas with OAR/Nemesis load order?\n6) Leveled lists: With SPID/KID/BOS heavy usage, should I still build a Bashed Patch for leveled lists, or rely on Synthesis patchers instead (and which ones)?\n7) Survival/QoL: If I keep CC Survival, what’s the best modern combo for needs/weather/temperature that plays nicely with Lux and doesn’t over‑script?\n8) LOD/grass: Is NGIO still the recommended path for grass caching, or has something newer replaced it? Any current DynDOLOD 3 pitfalls with Lux or Community Shaders I should know?\n\nIf you have a recent “vanilla‑plus 2025” core list (fixes → frameworks → UI/QoL → visuals → gameplay) that’s proven stable, I’d love to crib from it. Also happy to hear about any 2025‑era “don’t use X, use Y instead” replacements. Thanks!\n subreddit: skyrimmods",
  "title: Would transparent MMR actually reduce smurfing and ranked anxiety, or make everything worse?\n self_text: Most ranked games hide true MMR behind visible tiers/badges, which creates weird side effects: players feel “stuck” despite improving, smurfs farm calibration games to skip learning matches, and lobbies feel random because the system is correcting for hidden variables. Do you think making MMR visible (even roughly) would help? My hypothesis: show a range (e.g., 2350–2450) with a confidence meter that widens after off-role queues, role swaps, or long breaks, and narrows with recent, consistent play. Also display a simple pre-match “favored/even/underdog” tag with expected win chance so losses don’t feel like personal collapse when the matchmaker was stretching to find a game. Pair that with stricter smurf friction: required phone verification, provisional-only pool for new accounts (10–20 games), accelerated uncertainty so obviously high-skill players exit quickly, and harsher decay transparency (tell players when decay is active and how much). For small regions (I’m in NZ), let players opt into higher-ping cross-region queues with explicit warnings and separate MMR confidence, so people don’t feel forced to smurf for faster matches. I worry pure transparency could add pressure or promote MMR sniping, but hiding everything clearly isn’t working either. For folks who’ve worked on or studied these systems (or played a ton of OW/Valorant/Apex/League), what are the real pitfalls and trade-offs of showing MMR bands and match expectations? What would you add or remove from this proposal?\n subreddit: r/TrueGaming",

Flash a subtle icon if you’re sitting on capped shards/engram overflow.\n- Postmaster QoL: Filters (exotics/reds/legendaries), one-click “lock and send to vault,” and a warning if a drop will be deleted on next pickup.\n- Accessibility: Colorblind-friendly mechanic cues (icons/shapes alongside color for things like plates, nodes, wires). Shader previews with colorblind modes and high-contrast UI toggles for ability/overshield effects.\n- Social Spaces: A clan alcove showing who’s online and what they’re doing, with a “request to join activity” button.

  "title: Skyrim AE: Help me build a lightweight, crash‑resistant survival/RP load order (follower + QoL focused) for midrange PC\n self_text: Returning to AE after a couple years and aiming for a “vanilla-plus” survival/RP run that’s stable and light on scripts. I prefer offline, single‑player vibes with one follower, no ENB, 60 FPS cap, and minimal animation frameworks.\n\nMy setup/tools:\n- PC: i5‑12400F, RTX 3060 12 GB, 32 GB RAM, SATA SSD, 1080p/60\n- AE (Steam), clean install\n- MO2 + LOOT + xEdit; comfortable with cleaning, conflict resolution, and INI tweaks\n\nGoals (lightweight > flashy):\n- Survival/needs/cold + basic camping\n- Smart follower control + improved follower dialogue/banter\n- UI/QoL (better maps, notifications, sorting, favorites, journal)\n- Bug fixes and stability first\n- No ENB, minimal animation/behavior edits, keep combat close to vanilla\n\nPlanned baseline (sanity check me + tell me what I’m missing):\n- Core fixes: USSEP, Address Library, SSE Engine Fixes, Bug Fixes SSE, Scrambled Bugs, powerofthree’s Tweaks, PrivateProfileRedirector, SSE Display Tweaks, Crash Logger\n- Utilities: SkyUI, SPID, PO3 Papyrus Extender, Achievement Mods Enabler, More Informative Console\n- UI/QoL: iHUD or Simple HUD tweaks, Better Dialogue/MessageBox Controls, Quick Loot EE, Favorite Misc Items, Dear Diary Dark Mode (if stable), A Quality World Map (or Paper Map) + Flat Map Markers\n- World/visuals (very light): Cathedral Weathers, minimal texture touchups only if truly low impact\n- Start: Alternate Start – Live Another Life\n\nQuestions:\n1) Survival/needs/cold: For AE in 2025, what’s the lightest stable combo? SunHelm Survival and Needs vs. CC Survival Mode + tweaks vs. something else? Is there a truly lightweight camping option (Simple Camping?) that plays nice without heavy scripts/Campfire?\n2) Followers: What’s the least script‑heavy, AE‑friendly option among Nether’s Follower Framework, Simple Follower Tweaks, or AFT? I just need basic controls, sandboxing, and follower AI fixes—no big systems.\n3) Dialogue/banter: Is RDO still a safe pick on AE, or is there a more modern, lightweight alternative for expanded follower/NPC dialogue that avoids dirty edits?\n4) Stability must‑haves: Any AE‑specific “don’t leave home without it” NG plugins or CC content patches I should add to the baseline? Any known AE runtime gotchas to avoid?\n5) Load order skeleton: Do the fixes/utilities above look like a good foundation for a small survival + follower + QoL stack? Anything likely to conflict with SunHelm/CC Survival or follower frameworks?\n6) INI/perf tips: Any SSE Display Tweaks/BethINI settings you recommend for a locked 60 on 3060‑class hardware (no ENB)?\n\nIf you have a compact MO2 profile/Wabbajack rec that fits “vanilla‑plus survival/RP” and runs smoothly on midrange rigs, I’d love to try it.

  "title: Help me build a stable, Vanilla+ Skyrim SE/AE RP modlist (120-ish mods, laptop-friendly, no ENB)\n self_text: I’m planning a fresh roleplay playthrough on Skyrim SE/AE and want a stable, light-but-rich Vanilla+ list that won’t murder a midrange laptop. Looking to cap around ~120 plugins (ESL-flagged where possible), 1080p/60fps target, minimal script load, and no ENB (happy with lightweight weathers/reshade). I’m comfortable with MO2, LOOT, xEdit, and basic INI tweaks—just want a sanity-checked core and your favorite low-overhead immersion picks.\n\nSetup and constraints\n- Version: AE 1.6.640 on Windows 11, SKSE64\n- Hardware: 6-core CPU, 16 GB RAM, GTX 1660 Ti-class GPU\n- Goals: stable, crash-free, controller-friendly UI, colorblind-friendly options, light survival flavor, one follower, no giant quest packs, avoid heavy animation/script bloat\n- Not looking for: ENB, major overhauls that rewrite half the game, NSFW\n\nPlanned core (tell me if I’m missing anything critical or if anything’s redundant on AE)\n- Stability/engine: USSEP, Address Library, SSE Engine Fixes (Part 1+2), SSE Display Tweaks, Crash Logger SSE AE VR, Scrambled Bugs, Bug Fixes SSE, powerofthree’s Tweaks\n- Distribution/frameworks: SPID, KID, Base Object Swapper, Open Animation Replacer (OAR)\n- UI/QoL: SkyUI, moreHUD + moreHUD Inventory, QuickLoot EE, Better Dialogue Controls, Better MessageBox Controls\n- Visuals (lightweight): Cathedral Weathers and Seasons, Cathedral Landscapes, Majestic Mountains (Lite), Realistic Water 2, ELFX Lite or vanilla lighting + tweaks\n- Audio: Audio Overhaul for Skyrim, Immersive Sounds – Compendium (with patch)\n- Gameplay (light Vanilla+): WACCF, Smithing/Temper tweaks, Encounter Zone/Scaling tweaks (recommendations welcome), Wildcat or Valravn (which is lighter?), Simple Dodge MCO or no-dodge if that’s safer\n- Survival-lite: Use CC Survival Mode with Survival Mode Improved – SKSE (or a lightweight alternative)\n- Followers: Inigo or Lucien (only one). NFF for management, or is that overkill if I’m running just a single follower?\n\nQuestions where I’d love your experience\n1) AE-safe bugfix stack: Is my set (Engine Fixes, Scrambled Bugs, Po3 Tweaks, Bug Fixes SSE) all good together on 1.6.640? Any “don’t use X with Y” gotchas?\n2) UI for controller and colorblind: Any clean, controller-friendly HUD setups that also improve color readability? Is Dear Diary Dark Mode still the go-to with SkyUI on AE?\n3) Lighting/weather combos: Cathedral + ELFX Lite vs just Cathedral + vanilla lights—what’s the best stability/perf choice without ENB?\n4) Combat: Is True Directional Movement + SmoothCam too heavy for a laptop, or fine if I keep animations modest? If too heavy, what’s your favorite low-cost combat spice?\n5) SPID/KID best practices on AE: Any common pitfalls or load-order tips? I’ll patch in xEdit but want to avoid known landmines.\n6) LOD/grass: Worth doing xLODGen/DynDOLOD “lite,” or should I stick to optimized vanilla LOD packs to keep it simple on a laptop?\n\nIf you have a small, proven “Vanilla+ and stable on midrange” modlist you love, I’d really appreciate a link or a short loadout.

  "title: 2025 AE rebuild: help me de-bloat and modernize my survival/RP Skyrim load order (OAR/TDM/MCO, Lux vs ELFX, SunHelm vs CC Survival)\n self_text: Returning to SE/AE after a couple years away and I want to rebuild a stable, mostly-vanilla-feeling survival/RP playthrough with modern animation/combat and lightweight visuals. I’m on AE 1.6.x, Mod Organizer 2, SKSE64, LOOT, xEdit. Target is 60–90 FPS on an ultrawide with a midrange GPU, and minimal script latency.\n\nWhat I want to keep (core pillars)\n- Survival/immersion: needs, camping, colder nights, dangerous dungeons, slower power creep.\n- Roleplay: followers, town/inn ambience, subtle UI, grounded loot and economy.\n- Modern feel: true directional movement, responsive combat, better hitboxes, smart distribution (SPID), and OAR-based animations.\n- Stability first: clean logs, no runaway scripts, predictable save health.\n\nCurrent/planned stack (open to replacements)\n- Core fixes/QoL: USSEP, Address Library, SKSE + SSE Engine Fixes, SSE Display Tweaks, powerofthree’s Tweaks, Scrambled Bugs, Bug Fixes SSE, Papyrus Tweaks NG, Crash Logger, SPID.\n- UI/HUD: SkyUI, TrueHUD, SmoothCam, ultrawide fixes, a minimalist paper/dark UI skin (not decided), QuickLoot EE.\n- Visuals: leaning Cathedral Weathers + LUT, ENB Light, Particle Patch for ENB. I’ve long used ELFX + Embers XD, but Lux keeps getting recommended.\n- Survival: undecided between SunHelm vs CC Survival Mode (tuned) + Campfire/Campsite. Previously used iNeed and Frostfall but I hear SunHelm is lighter.\n- Combat/Anims: True Directional Movement, ADXP/MCO, Precision, Open Animation Replacer (migrating off DAR), maybe Valhalla/SkySA-like pacing, EVG Conditionals, dodge mod, and a small set of OAR packs (no animation soup).\n- World/system: WACCF/CCOR-style consistency? Vanilla plus with keyword sanity, but I don’t want a huge patch burden.\n- Patching: Wrye Bash for leveled lists or Synthesis patchers if that’s the modern meta.\n\nQuestions where I’d love 2025-informed advice\n1) OAR migration: Any gotchas moving from DAR to OAR on AE? Must-have OAR frameworks or rulesets that keep things clean and reversible?\n2) TDM + MCO + Precision: What’s the current stable combo (versions and order), and are there conflicts with dodge frameworks or SCAR? Any hard requirements like Payload Interpreter I should plan around?\n3) Lux vs ELFX for a playthrough: For stability, patch workload, and dungeon readability, would you pick Lux (and Lux Orbis) or stick with a curated ELFX + Embers XD? I’m okay doing a few patches, just not 50.\n4) Survival direction: SunHelm vs tuned CC Survival Mode in 2025—what’s lighter on scripts and better balanced long-term? If SunHelm, any must-have compatibility tips? If CC Survival, recommended tweaks to keep it engaging but not punishing?\n5) Lightweight economy/loot: Recommendations to slow power creep without turning the game into a grind? I’d like calmer loot tables and pricier services without dozens of patches.\n6) Modern “essentials” I might be missing: Any low-overhead fixes in 2025 that are now considered core (NG variants, animation limit fixes, Havok tweaks, etc.)?\n7) Patching workflow: Is Synthesis now preferred over Wrye Bash for leveled lists and distribution, or still “both depending on the list”? Any go-to patchers you never skip for a vanilla-plus build?\n\nConstraints and preferences\n- I’d like to keep plugins low via ESL-flagging. I’m comfortable cleaning in xEdit and doing a Smashed/Bashed/Synth patch if needed—but I don’t want a 1,000-mod labyrinth.\n- Followers are okay, but I want to avoid heavy script followers and big city overhauls.\n- ENB is optional; I’ll take clarity and performance over screenshots.\n\nIf you have a tried-and-true 2025 survival/RP skeleton (core fixes, combat, survival, lighting, UI) or a “migration checklist” for AE that avoids the common pitfalls, I’d love to copy the blueprint.

I don’t care much about RT, but I do use texture/visual mods (VRAM hungry).\n\nShortlist and current NZD pricing I’m seeing (PB Tech/Computer Lounge/Playtech/Mighty Ape):\n- RTX 4070 Super 12GB: ~$1,099–$1,199\n- RX 7900 GRE 16GB: ~$949–$1,049\n- RX 7800 XT 16GB: ~$899–$999\n\nQuestions:\n1) 12GB vs 16GB at 1440p for modded Bethesda games/Bannerlord long-term—am I going to regret 12GB?\n2) DLSS 3/Frame Gen vs FSR 3 in my mix (Apex/OW2/D2/Skyrim/RDR2). Real-world benefit on Nvidia vs AMD here?\n3) I occasionally record gameplay—does NVENC/AV1 make the 4070S the safer pick?\n4) PSU headroom: Is my Focus GX-650 fine for 7900 GRE/7800 XT? Any transient spike issues I should worry about?\n5) NZXT H510 owners: do the chunky triple-fan cards fit and breathe okay? Any heat-soak/coil whine experiences?\n6) Driver stability on AMD recently for Destiny 2/Apex/OW2 at 1440p high refresh—anything to watch out for?\n7) Worth waiting for Black Friday here in NZ, or are these prices about as good as it gets before Xmas?\n\nNot chasing RT or 4K; just smooth, quiet 1440p with some VRAM headroom for mods.

  "title: Make ranked honest: visible MMR bands, post‑match SR deltas, and smarter smurf handling (NZ player perspective)\n self_text: OCE/NZ player here with 160–220ms most nights and weird off‑peak queues. I’m not asking for a total matchmaker rewrite, just more transparency and some low‑risk knobs that could help trust without exploding queue times.\n\nIdeas:\n- Visible MMR bands per role: Show a simple range (e.g., 2350–2550) plus a confidence meter. SR can stay as the “pretty” number, but let us see the band and confidence so swings make sense.\n- Post‑match breakdown: “Your team avg MMR vs theirs, expected outcome, your SR delta, and how much confidence changed.” Not KDA-based grades, just context for why we gained/lost.\n- Confidence-driven calibration: After role swaps or long inactivity, temporarily raise volatility so legit climbers move faster and misplaced accounts settle quicker.\n- Smurf acceleration, not quarantine: Detect rapid win streaks with outlier performance and increase volatility to place them fast, cap group size until stabilized, and limit partying with huge MMR gaps for the first X comp games on new accounts.\n- New account on‑ramp: A short unranked evaluation playlist with stricter matching so brand‑new players don’t land in Bronze lobbies with smurfs.\n- Party spread controls: Show a “spread severity” badge in queue. If it’s extreme, either make it no‑rank‑change casual for that party or let solo players opt out of those lobbies without a penalty.\n- Off‑peak knob: Before queueing, show a “match quality stretch” estimate. Give a Strict vs Fast toggle so we can choose tighter MMR or shorter waits, especially in OCE.\n- Leaver/backfill clarity: If a leaver happens, clearly state how SR/MMR is adjusted for both teams.\n- UI/QoL: Colorblind‑friendly rank colors, a simple rank progress graph over the season, and a per‑role match history export.\n- Privacy: Make metadata export opt‑in and anonymized, but let nerds dig into their own numbers.\n\nQuestions:\n- Would you accept slightly longer queues for this level of clarity?\n- OCE folks: would Strict vs Fast actually help our off‑peak pain?\n- Dev angle: is exposing a band + confidence (not exact MMR) safe enough to prevent targeted abuse while building trust?\n\nCurious what the community thinks and which pieces feel realistic for the current system.\n subreddit: Overwatch",

Worth grabbing GPU now and platform swapping later (likely AM5 or 12th/13th‑gen Intel DDR5)?\n- Any current AMD driver gotchas in Destiny 2/Apex/War Thunder on Win 11? (I’ve heard D2 and War Thunder favor Nvidia some patches.)\n- Frame generation: 4070 DLSS 3 vs AMD FSR 3 — good for single‑player only, or usable in shooters without awful input latency?\n- Is my 650W Gold comfortable for RX 6800 or borderline for a 3080?\n- NZ‑specific price/perf picks right now and stores to watch for deals?\n\nLeaning RX 6800 if I can land one sub‑$700 for the VRAM and raster perf; otherwise a discounted 4070 for DLSS/FG/NVENC. Or is a cheap 6700 XT still a worthwhile jump from a GTX 1080 at 1440p? Appreciate any Oceania‑market perspectives.\n\n subreddit: r/buildapc",

Looking for your minimum viable core list (engine/bugfix/QoL) plus one survival, one follower, and one combat pick that play nice together on AE 1.6.1170+.\n\nGoals\n- 120–150 plugins max\n- Survival‑lite (hunger/cold/needs, simple camping)\n- Smarter followers (no harem), light management\n- Better but not hyper‑complex combat\n- 60+ FPS at 1440p, no adult content, low script overhead\n- I’m comfortable with LOOT, xEdit, BethINI, DynDOLOD/xLODGen if needed\n\nRig (for context)\n- Ryzen 5 5600, 32 GB RAM, RX 6700 XT 12 GB, NVMe SSD, 1440p/75 Hz\n\nProposed core (please sanity‑check for AE)\n- USSEP\n- SKSE64 (AE) + Address Library\n- SSE Engine Fixes (AE), part 2 installed\n- SSE Display Tweaks\n- Crash Logger SSE AE VR (for post‑crash stack traces)\n- Scrambled Bugs + Bug Fixes SSE (is the overlap safe/expected in 2025?)\n- po3 Papyrus Extender + po3 Tweaks (AE versions)\n- MCM Helper\n- SPID + KID + Base Object Swapper\n- ENB Helper SE (even if I run a lightweight ReShade/ENB)\n- Powerofthree’s Tweaks, Equip Enchantment Fix, etc. (which of these are still “must‑have”?)\n\nQuestions\n1) Redundancy: In 2025 AE, is Scrambled Bugs + Bug Fixes SSE + Engine Fixes still the recommended trio, or should any be trimmed due to overlap?\n2) Followers: Is Nether’s Follower Framework still the safest on AE, or is EFF preferable now? Any lightweight alternatives you recommend for a single‑companion RP playthrough? Bonus: simple outfit manager that won’t fight NFF.\n3) Survival‑lite: Sunhelm vs iNeed NG vs CC Survival Mode (+ Survival Control Panel). Which is the least script‑heavy and least crash‑prone on AE? I mainly want hunger/cold and simple camping.\n4) Combat: For stability/perf, would you pick Valhalla Combat (no MCO), or MCO/ADXP + TDM + a dodge mod? Is Precision still considered safe/perf‑friendly on mid‑range GPUs, or better to skip? I’m okay with Nemesis/DAR if it’s not a time bomb.\n5) LOD/lighting: For “lite,” should I do xLODGen only and skip DynDOLOD 3, or is Dyndolod 3 fine on 8–12 GB VRAM at 1440p if I keep rules conservative? For interiors, is Lux + ENB Light too heavy, and is there a lighter, stable alternative?\n6) Cleaning and patching: Current best practice is still “don’t clean masters” on AE unless a mod author explicitly says so, right? Any common conflict patches I should generate with Synthesis/Bashed Patch in a minimal setup?\n7) Known problem children on AE 1.6.1170: Any once‑popular mods I should avoid nowadays (obsolete memory fixes, old light plugins, etc.) that create instability with the modern core above?\n\nIf you can, drop:\n- Your minimal engine/bugfix/QoL core\n- One survival mod (with settings you use)\n- One follower framework (plus any “must” companion QoL)\n- One combat setup (light but satisfying)\n- Any load order gotchas or SKSE plugin version pins I should know\n\nThanks!

I mainly play modded single‑player RPGs/sandboxes (Skyrim SE/FO4 with lots of script/QoL mods, Bannerlord, Total War WH3, RimWorld, Project Zomboid, No Man’s Sky, Minecraft shaders) and hop into shooters (Destiny 2, Apex, Overwatch). Goal is 1440p high/ultra: 100–165 FPS in shooters, 60–90+ in RPG/strategy.\n\nCurrent rig:\n- i7‑8700K @ 5.0 GHz (delidded) on Z370\n- 32 GB DDR4‑3200\n- GTX 1080 Ti 11 GB\n- 1 TB NVMe + 2 TB SATA SSD\n- Seasonic Focus 650W Gold\n- 1440p 165 Hz G‑Sync Compatible display\n- Case airflow is fine; not thermal throttling\n\nPain points:\n- CPU‑bound hitches in Bannerlord sieges and big TW:WH3 battles; script load in modded Skyrim/FO4 causes stutters.\n- GPU limits in newer titles and heavy ENB/shaders; no DLSS/FG; older NVENC.\n- I value low noise/efficiency (power isn’t cheap here) and prefer to keep the box stable for long sessions.\n\nOptions I’m considering (rough NZD street pricing):\nA) GPU now, keep 8700K:\n- RTX 4070 Super (~$1,050–$1,150) — concern: 12 GB VRAM longevity at 1440p with mods\n- RTX 4080 Super (~$1,800–$1,950) — pricey, likely need PSU upgrade\n- RX 7900 XT/XTX (~$1,300–$1,650) — great raster/VRAM; FSR3 OK but I use DLSS where available\nPros: Big gains in GPU‑bound titles; AV1 (NVIDIA) for occasional capture. Cons: 8700K might bottleneck in my CPU‑heavy games.\n\nB) Platform now, keep 1080 Ti:\n- Ryzen 7 7800X3D (~$620–$680), B650 board (~$300–$400), 32 GB DDR5‑6000 CL30 (~$180–$230)\n- Reuse cooler/storage/PSU; total ~$1,100–$1,300\nPros: Huge uplift in CPU‑bound titles (Skyrim/FO4/Bannerlord/TW). Cons: 1080 Ti becomes the ceiling in newer GPU‑heavy games.\n\nC) Wait:\n- See if spring sales/Black Friday move 4080S/7900XTX pricing; maybe Zen 5X3D timing/rumors settle.\n\nQuestions:\n1) For my game mix at 1440p, is 7800X3D + 1080 Ti the smarter 12–18 month move, or will the GPU hold me back so much that I should go 4070S/7900XT first?\n2) If I go 4070S now, how often will the 8700K @5.0 be a noticeable bottleneck in Bannerlord/TW/Skyrim modded? Anyone with similar jump experience?\n3) If choosing NVIDIA, is 12 GB on 4070S enough for mod‑heavy 1440p long‑term, or should I stretch to 4080S? If AMD, any gotchas with FSR3/frame‑gen in my listed titles?\n4) PSU: is my Focus 650W OK for 7800X3D + 1080 Ti (seems yes) and for 4070S (likely yes), but marginal for 4080S/7900XTX? Would you proactively bump to 750–850W?\n5) NZ‑specific: recommended B650 boards (leaning TUF B650‑Plus/MSI B650 Tomahawk/Gigabyte B650 Aorus Elite AX) and reliable local GPU models/prices?\n\nI’m comfortable with undervolting/OC, XMP/EXPO, and keeping things cool/quiet.

Quiet build preferred.\n\nNZ pricing (rough, from PB Tech/CL/Mighty Ape):\n- 7800 XT: ~$800–900 NZD\n- 4070 Super: ~$1000–1100 NZD\n- 7900 GRE: sometimes ~$900 on sale\n- 5800X3D (AM4 drop-in): ~$450–500\n- AM5 step: B650 + 32 GB DDR5-6000 ~$400–500, CPU 7600 ~$300–350, 7800X3D ~$700–800\n\nQuestions:\n1) Given my mix (modded open-worlds + shooters), is 5800X3D the best value uplift while keeping the 6700 XT for now, or am I already GPU-bound at 1440p?\n2) If I upgrade GPU first, 7800 XT vs 4070 Super vs 7900 GRE for NZ pricing/power and longevity? Concerned about VRAM for texture packs; does 12 GB on 4070S feel tight long-term? DLSS vs FSR matters in Destiny/Overwatch/Apex.\n3) Sensible path: 7600 on AM5 now with my 6700 XT, then a GPU later? Or just go 5800X3D and ride AM4 another 2–3 years?\n4) Any NZ retailer/deal timing tips (PB Tech/CL/Mighty Ape, Black Friday/Singles Day) and stock/queue quirks for these cards?\n5) Is my Cooler Master 750W Gold fine for 7800 XT/4070S? Any coil whine or driver issues I should expect locally? I dual-boot Windows, dabble with Linux, and occasionally macOS—driver stability matters. Also using ASUS Aura for RGB sync.\n\nHappy to tweak PBO/CO, fan curves, and undervolt. Appreciate any OCE/NZ-specific takes and build paths that avoid expensive dead-ends.

  "title: AE survival with minimal script load — SunHelm vs CC Survival (or both?), Campfire alternatives, and follower/QoL picks for a 100+ hr run\n self_text: Hey all, looking to lock in a stable, script‑light survival playthrough on AE without turning my save into a ticking time bomb. I’ve done the heavy Frostfall days; this time I want “set it and forget it” systems that won’t melt Papyrus over 100+ hours.\n\nContext\n- Platform: Skyrim AE (Steam, 1.6.x), MO2, SKSE. Comfortable with LOOT/xEdit, SPID/KID/BOS. Not chasing ENB visual overhauls.\n- Goal: Survival/needs, camping, weather/temperature gameplay, and smart followers, all with minimal cloak polls/MCM spaghetti. Prefer SKSE/native solutions over heavy scripts. Achievements intact if possible.\n\nMy current core baseline\n- USSEP, Address Library, SSE Engine Fixes (incl. Part 2), Scrambled Bugs, powerofthree’s Tweaks, Bug Fixes SSE, po3 Papyrus Extender, Crash Logger, SSE Display Tweaks.\n- Distribution/patching: SPID, KID, Base Object Swapper. Will patch in xEdit as needed.\n\nWhere I’m torn\n- Needs/survival: SunHelm vs CC Survival Mode (with “Survival Mode Improved”/SKSE tweaks). Anyone running SunHelm standalone vs layering it with CC Survival (with fatigue/hunger disabled in one or the other)? Is “both” sane or just redundant/conflict‑prone in 2025?\n- Camping: Campfire is the classic, but I’ve heard Simple Camping or lightweight camping frameworks are lower overhead. What’s the current low‑script pick that still feels good to use?\n- Warmth/frost integration: Best modern approach to warmth keywords/gear integration without Frostfall’s heavy region scans? SPID/KID setups you recommend to tag cloaks/armors for warmth and distribute torches/furs logically to NPCs?\n- Followers: Is Simple Follower Tweaks still the go‑to for low overhead vs Nether’s? Any must‑have lightweight follower bugfix/QoL combo in 2025 that avoids heartbeat scripts?\n- Movement/combat QoL that stays light: True Directional Movement + SmoothCam + OAR animations feel okay, but does adding MCO turn into script/event spam long‑term, or is it fine paired with Precision/Valhalla/TK Dodge RE (native)?\n\nWhat I don’t want\n- Frostfall‑tier cloak polling or lots of constant magic effects ticking.\n- Giant quest overhauls or heavy AI frameworks that balloon save bloat.\n- Anything that’s notorious for papyrus spikes when combined with survival.\n\nNice‑to‑haves\n- Achievements Mods Enabler compatibility.\n- Simple in‑world reminders for eating/sleeping that don’t rely on spammy notifications.\n- Weather/region integration that actually matters for survival without running a dozen climate scripts.\n\nIf you’ve got a 2025‑tested, script‑light survival/follower/QoL combo (and any conflict notes or specific patches you used), I’d love to see your picks and why. Bonus points for SPID/KID snippets or tips like “disable X MCM feature” that noticeably lowers script load. Thanks!\n subreddit: skyrimmods",
  "title: What would a truly transparent ranked system look like? Pitching a \"Ranked Clarity\" panel for shooters/MOBAs\nself_text: Across games like Overwatch, Apex, Valorant, League, Destiny 2, etc., I keep running into the same ranked pain points: hidden MMR, confusing gains/losses, placement anxiety, and “was that a smurf?” paranoia. I get why devs hide a lot (to prevent gaming the system, reduce tilt, and keep flexibility), but it feels like we’ve swung too far into opacity.\n\nIf you were designing a ranked UI from scratch, what would you expose? Here’s my pitch for a lightweight “Ranked Clarity” panel that could sit next to the queue button without turning the game into a spreadsheet:\n\n- Your visible rank + hidden rating: Show a rating number with a confidence band (e.g., 2,150 ± 80). Confidence climbs as you play; decays over inactivity.\n- Expected gains/losses: Before queue, show the current range you’ll likely win/lose (e.g., +18 to +24 / −20 to −26) based on your confidence and recent lobby strength. After match, show a simple breakdown: outcome weight, lobby MMR delta, personal performance factor (if used), and penalties (leaves/dodges).\n- Queue scope and time: Display how the search is expanding over time. Example: “0:30 — ±100 MMR, local region; 1:45 — ±250 MMR, cross‑region enabled.” As someone in NZ, I’d love to know when the matchmaker starts broadening to keep wait times sane.\n- Party impact: Explain how mixed-rank parties are handled. Show the calculated party MMR, any clamping applied, and what that means for expected gains/losses.\n- Placement and decay rules: Spell out the exact number of placement matches, volatility while calibrating, and a clear decay schedule (how much, how often, how to recover).\n- Smurf/alt handling without witch hunts: Don’t label players, but label lobbies. Example: “Volatility: High — several accounts in calibration.” That sets expectations without targeting individuals.\n- Match integrity signal: A small banner if the match was outside “ideal” parameters (large MMR spread, high ping region, odd stack sizes), so a weird RR/LP result isn’t a mystery.\n- Privacy toggles: Let players opt in to share detailed rating history publicly or keep it private. The clarity panel is for you by default.\n\nQuestions for the hive mind:\n- Would this reduce frustration and conspiracy theories, or just create new targets for abuse?\n- Is showing a number with a confidence band “safe” enough to prevent precise reverse‑engineering?\n- Which games do this best today? Rocket League’s progress felt straightforward; Dota shows MMR, Valorant shows RR but hides MMR; CS2 shows a bar. What actually made you trust a system?\n- For regions with low pop, would exposing queue scope help players accept occasional mismatches?\n- If you could only pick two items from this panel for devs to implement, which would have the biggest impact?\n\nCurious to hear both player and dev perspectives. I don’t need perfect transparency, just enough to make results feel explainable and fair.\nsubreddit: truegaming",
  "title: 2025 AE essentials for a stable, no‑ENB Skyrim run — sanity check my core list?\n self_text: Returning to mod AE for a single‑player, no‑ENB playthrough focused on stability, QoL, and performance. Target is “feels vanilla+,” minimal new quests, nothing super script‑heavy. I’m on MO2 + LOOT + xEdit, staying on current AE (1.6.x) rather than downgrading. Can you sanity‑check this core stack and flag anything outdated/missing?\n\nCore/bugfix/QoL I’m planning:\n- SKSE64 (AE) + Address Library (AE, correct version for my exe)\n- USSEP\n- SSE Engine Fixes (Part 1 + preloader/TBB)\n- SSE Display Tweaks (cap to 60/90/120; Havok settings; borderless tweaks)\n- Scrambled Bugs (common toggles: EquipBestAmmo=false, PerkEntryPoints:ApplySpells? etc.)\n- Bug Fixes SSE\n- po3 Tweaks (select features only)\n- Crash Logger SSE AE VR (Fudgyduff) + .NET Script Framework NOT used on AE\n- SkyUI SE\n- Fuz Ro D’oh (silent voice)\n- SPID (for lightweight distributions) + BOS (for swaps)\n- Open Animation Replacer (OAR) as DAR replacement\n- Nemesis only if I add behavior mods (no FNIS mixing)\n- XPMSSE + Simple Dual Sheath NG (via Synthesis) if I go dual‑sheath\n- Wrye Bash (leveled list Bashed Patch)\n- xEdit for cleaning/ESL‑flagging where safe\n- BethINI (only for a clean baseline; then manual INI tweaks)\n- Optional: ENB Particle Patch (still helpful without ENB), DynDOLOD 3/xLODGen later if I decide on LODs\n\nGoals/constraints:\n- No ENB, maybe very light ReShade for color/clarity only\n- Avoid heavy new scripts/AI overhauls; prefer engine‑side fixes and lightweight QoL\n- Keep physics sane above 60 FPS (no jank at 90/120)\n- Avoid outdated “fixes” (Safety Load, old Havok patches, .NET SF on AE, etc.)\n\nQuestions:\n1) Any 2025 must‑have bugfixes/tweaks I missed or redundant items I should drop?\n2) Best‑practice INI toggles with Display Tweaks + Engine Fixes for stable high FPS without physics explosions?\n3) Current consensus on CC patches — is “Unofficial Creation Club Content Patches (USCCCP)” still the go‑to hub, or a newer alternative?\n4) For crash triage, is Crash Logger + CommonLibSSE logs enough, or do you recommend any specific parser/guide?\n5) Any gotchas with SPID/BOS + SDS NG + OAR ordering or Synthesis patching I should watch for?\n6) Simple texture upgrades: prefer 2K over 4K to save VRAM — any modern “one‑stop” texture packs that are safe and consistent with vanilla art?\n\nIf you have a current “essentials only” modlist that’s AE‑friendly and rock‑solid, I’d love to crib from it.

Looking for some NZ‑centric GPU advice for a 1440p/144Hz upgrade.\n\nCurrent rig:\n- CPU: Ryzen 5 5600 (stock)\n- Cooler: CM Hyper 212\n- Mobo: ASUS TUF B550‑Plus\n- RAM: 32GB DDR4‑3600 CL16\n- GPU: GTX 1080 Ti\n- PSU: Seasonic Focus 650 Gold (2020)\n- Case: NZXT H510 (2x front intake, 1x rear exhaust)\n- Monitor: 27\" 1440p 165Hz FreeSync (G‑Sync Compatible)\n\nUse case:\n- Games: Modded Skyrim AE, Bannerlord, RimWorld, No Man’s Sky, RDR2, Destiny 2, Apex (I favor offline/single‑player but do play D2/Apex).\n- Occasional light video edits (DaVinci Resolve, nothing heavy), streaming/recording is rare.\n- Quiet build preferred; RGB is a bonus (ASUS Aura friendly) but not essential.\n\nBudget/prices I’m seeing (PB Tech/Computer Lounge/Mighty Ape as reference):\n- RTX 4070 Super: ~$1,100–$1,250 NZD\n- RX 6800 XT: ~$850–$1,000 NZD\n- RX 7900 GRE/7800 XT: ~$1,000–$1,200 NZD / ~$900–$1,050 NZD\n\nQuestions:\n1) PSU headroom: Is my Seasonic Focus 650W Gold sufficient for a 6800 XT or 7900 GRE in this setup, or is it safer to stick to a 4070 Super for lower draw? I can undervolt, but I’d rather not replace the PSU right now.\n2) Value at 1440p: For my mix of RPG/sandbox and some shooters, is the 6800 XT still the NZ value king, or do the 4070 Super’s DLSS 3/Frame Gen and NVENC advantages justify the premium? I’m not super sensitive to RT, but I do care about smooth 1% lows.\n3) Destiny 2/Apex stability: Any recent driver quirks on AMD vs NVIDIA I should know about (stutters, shader comp, crashing) at 1440p high settings?\n4) Thermals/airflow: H510 owners—did a front panel mod or adding a top exhaust help GPU temps noticeably with big cards like the 6800 XT/7900 GRE? I want it quiet without roasting the case.\n5) Model recommendations/avoid: Any NZ‑available models to target/avoid? (e.g., Sapphire Pulse/Nitro+, PowerColor Hellhound/Red Devil, MSI Gaming X Trio, ASUS TUF, Gigabyte Gaming OC).\n6) CPU bottlenecking: Is it worth jumping to a 5700X3D first for better 1% lows in CPU‑bound titles (Skyrim/Bannerlord), or will the 1080 Ti be the obvious bottleneck and I should prioritize the GPU now?\n\nGoal: High settings 1440p at ~120–165 Hz in shooters and ultra/high in single‑player titles with good 1% lows, minimal coil whine, and reasonable power.\n\nAppreciate any NZ‑specific experiences (retailer warranty, open‑box deals, model availability) and real‑world thermals/noise.

Any lighter, modern alternatives? Are Synthesis patchers the go-to over zEdit in 2025?\n- LOD/perf: DynDOLOD 3 minimal okay on 3060 Ti at 1440p? Favorite low-VRAM texture packs (Cathedral/Noble/HD Reworked lite?) that stay clean and consistent?\n- CC/AE coverage: What’s the best-maintained AE Creation Club patch compendium now?\n- Crash tools: Crash Logger SSE NG still the standard?

I used to run big SE modlists (LOOT/xEdit/Nemesis/etc.), but I’ve been out of the loop since AE landed and I’d love a modern, lightweight, controller‑first setup that won’t implode 40 hours in.\n\nWhat I’m aiming for:\n- Stability first: SKSE plugin baseline, engine/bug fixes, and best practices to avoid mid‑playthrough corruption and script bloat.\n- Controller‑friendly UI/UX: clean inventory/map menus, on‑screen prompts, quick‑loot, better lock‑on/movement/camera, and smarter controller bindings (combo inputs are fine).\n- Follower/QoL: non‑invasive follower framework, smarter AI, better command controls from a gamepad, and a few RP niceties (idle fixes, relationship dialogue tweaks).\n- Performance: 1440p 60 fps target on a midrange GPU; I’m not chasing ENB eye candy this time, just readable fonts, good fonts/scaling for couch distance, and dark‑mode-ish menus.\n- Minimal content bloat: I prefer “vanilla+” over massive overhauls; survival needs are a maybe (lightweight hunger/temp) if controller flow stays good.\n\nQuestions:\n1) AE vs “downgrader” in 2025: is it still worth staying on a specific runtime for SKSE plugin coverage, or is current AE fine if I stick to actively maintained plugins?\n2) Must‑have stability stack: beyond USSEP, what’s the current recommended set (Address Library, Engine Fixes, Display Tweaks, Scrambled Bugs, powerofthree’s Tweaks/Papyrus Extender, etc.)? Anything new I shouldn’t miss?\n3) Controller/UI picks: what are your go‑to mods/configs for a gamepad? Looking for SkyUI‑friendly gamepad configs, quick‑loot that plays nice with controllers, True Directional Movement + SmoothCam setups, Improved Camera, Gamepad++ (or equivalent), and any menu overhauls that actually scale well at 8–10 feet.\n4) Followers: is Nether’s still the safest bet for a low‑drama framework on AE, or is there a lighter alternative that behaves better with controllers? Any follower AI mods that don’t tank scripts?\n5) Wabbajack: are there any actively maintained, controller‑first “vanilla+” lists you’d recommend as a base that I can prune/extend?\n6) Pitfalls to avoid: common AE plugin/version gotchas, animation stack advice (Nemesis vs OAR workflows), MCM config tips for gamepad users, and any conflicts with quick‑loot/lock‑on/camera mods.\n\nHappy to share specs/load order as I go; just trying to start with a sane foundation this time.
