  "title: Microstutter every ~10s after RAM upgrade — high FPS but choppy\n self_text: Swapped RAM and now my frametimes are wrecked even though FPS is high. Looking for tuning tips before I return this kit.\n\nRig:\n- CPU: Ryzen 5 5600X\n- GPU: RTX 3080 FE\n- Mobo: MSI B550 Tomahawk\n- RAM: 2x16GB G.Skill 3600 CL18 (QVL)\n- Storage: 980 Pro NVMe\n- PSU: RM750x\n- OS: Windows 11 23H2\n- BIOS: Latest (AGESA 1.2.0.x)\n\nWhat’s happening:\n- In Warzone 2, Apex, Cyberpunk I’m at 140–200 FPS, but every 10–20 seconds I get a nasty stutter. Frametime graph spikes to 40–80ms.\n- Temps are fine (CPU <70C, GPU <75C). GPU/CPU usage looks normal, no throttling.\n\nWhat I tried:\n- DDU + fresh NVIDIA driver, latest AMD chipset drivers\n- Clear CMOS, fresh BIOS flash\n- MemTest86 (4 passes) = 0 errors\n- LatencyMon shows occasional spikes (ndis.sys, nvlddmkm.sys)\n- HAGS on/off, Game Mode on/off, HPET off\n- High Performance power plan, disabled overlays, closed background apps\n- Resize BAR/SAM on/off\n- Fixed pagefile (8–32GB)\n- XMP off at 2133 = stutters gone\n- Manual 3200 CL16 = much better but not perfect\n- XMP 3600 CL18 = stutters return\n\nVoltages/rails (HWInfo, Auto unless noted):\n- FCLK 1800 (1:1:1), UCLK=MCLK 1800\n- SoC ~1.00V, VDDG CCD/IOD ~0.95V, VDDP ~0.90V\n- Command Rate 1T, Gear Down Mode enabled\n- No WHEA errors logged\n\nQuestions:\n1) Should I just run 3200 CL16 with tighter subs for smooth frametimes, or can 3600 be made stable on 2x16?\n2) Safe/typical SoC bump on 5000 series to stabilize IF at 1800? (e.g., SoC 1.05–1.10V, VDDG ~1.0–1.05V, VDDP ~0.9–0.95V)\n3) Would forcing CR 2T and/or disabling GDM help with 2x16 dual-rank stability and frametime consistency?\n4) Any known MSI B550 + 2x16 quirks I should be aware of (bios settings like Power Down Enable, ProcODT, CAD Bus presets)?\n5) If I drop to FCLK 1733 (3466 MT/s) or 1600 (3200 MT/s), is the 1:1:1 sync more important for smoothness than raw bandwidth?\n\nOpen to a known-good 5600X tune template for 2x16 at 3600, or confirmation that 3200 CL16 tight is the play for stutter-free gaming.

  "title: 5800X3D + 4070 Ti microstutter/frame time spikes despite low usage — what am I missing?\n self_text: Hey folks, hoping someone can point me in the right direction because I’m stumped.\n\nRig:\n- CPU: Ryzen 7 5800X3D (stock, PBO off)\n- Cooler: Peerless Assassin 120 SE\n- GPU: RTX 4070 Ti (MSI, stock)\n- RAM: 32GB (2x16) DDR4 3600 CL16, XMP enabled (passes TM5 Anta777 & 4 passes MemTest86)\n- Mobo: MSI B550 Tomahawk (latest BIOS with AGESA 1.2.0.x)\n- Storage: 1TB SN850X (OS), 2TB SN770 (games)\n- PSU: Corsair RM850x (2021)\n- Display: 1440p 165Hz G-Sync Compatible (VRR)\n- Windows 11 Pro 23H2\n\nThe issue:\n- Fortnite, Warzone, Apex, and even OW2 show smooth averages (120–200+ fps), but every ~5–15 seconds I get a nasty frame time spike (from ~6–8ms to 30–80ms) that feels like a hitch/microstutter.\n- During spikes, neither CPU nor GPU hits 100% (GPU ~60–80%, CPU per-core ~30–60%). Temps are fine (CPU ~65–75C, GPU ~60C). Power limits not hit. No disk spikes.\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n- DDU in Safe Mode, fresh 552.xx and 551.xx NVIDIA drivers (with and without GeForce Experience)\n- HAGS on/off, Game Mode on/off, V-Sync off, Low Latency Mode Off/On/Ultra\n- G-Sync Compatible on (fullscreen + windowed) vs off; tried capping at 162fps via RTSS and in-game caps\n- MPO (Multiplane Overlay) registry disable test\n- Nvidia Control Panel: set “Prefer max performance,” threaded opt auto/off\n- ReBAR on/off (BIOS + NVIDIA Profile Inspector)\n- PCIE Gen to Gen3 vs Auto\n- BIOS: PBO off, CPPC on, CPPC Preferred Cores on; tried Windows Balanced vs AMD High Perf vs NVIDIA perf plan\n- HPET on/off tests (bcdedit and device manager)\n- Fresh Windows 11 install last week\n- Background stuff trimmed (disabled overlays, Xbox Game Bar, Discord/Steam overlay, RGB apps)\n- Checked polling rates (mouse 1000Hz → 500Hz), tried different USB ports\n- Moved games to OS NVMe; disabled Xbox Game Bar DVR/recording and HWiNFO polling during play\n\nObservations:\n- Frame time graph in RTSS/HWiNFO shows clean line then a sudden spike, no obvious CPU/GPU/VRAM/IO peaks.\n- Some games stutter worse in DX12 vs DX11 (Fortnite DX12 is worst).\n- If I set an fps cap well below GPU limit (e.g., 141 on 165Hz), spikes reduce but aren’t gone.\n- Happens on both fresh OS and after tweaks. Network is stable (wired).\n\nIs there anything glaring I’m missing? BIOS/AGESA quirk with 5800X3D, driver branch weirdness for 4070 Ti, or known Windows 11/VRR/MPO issue that matches this? Would love recommended known-good NVIDIA driver + settings combo for 5800X3D/4070 Ti + 1440p VRR, or any advanced troubleshooting (latencymon, selective service disables, scheduler tweaks, etc.) I should try next.\n\nThanks in advance — I just want consistent frame times, not necessarily higher averages.\n subreddit: buildapc",
  "title: Micro-stutters/1% low tanking on 5800X3D + 4070 Ti — frametime spikes every 20–30s\n self_text: Upgraded a few weeks ago and I’m stumped. FPS averages look fine, but every 20–30 seconds I get a noticeable hitch with frametime spiking to 60–120ms. It’s super distracting in shooters even though overall FPS is high.\n\nSpecs:\n- CPU: Ryzen 7 5800X3D (stock, PBO off)\n- Cooler: Peerless Assassin 120 SE\n- Mobo: MSI X570 Tomahawk (latest BIOS, AGESA up to date)\n- RAM: 32GB (2x16) DDR4-3600 CL16 (XMP on, dual channel confirmed)\n- GPU: RTX 4070 Ti (clean driver install w/ DDU, tried 552.xx and 551.xx)\n- Storage: 1TB NVMe (games + OS), 30% free\n- PSU: Corsair RM750x\n- OS: Windows 11 23H2\n\nWhat I’m seeing:\n- Cyberpunk, Warzone, Apex, Fortnite: smooth for ~30s, then a frametime spike; repeats\n- 1440p 165Hz G-Sync monitor. GPU 60–95% depending on game; CPU 15–35% (per core varies)\n- Temps look fine: CPU 60–72C, GPU 65–72C\n- Disk usage low, no obvious background hogs\n- 1% lows are way below expected; averages are normal\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n- DDU in Safe Mode → fresh NVIDIA install (no GeForce Experience)\n- Chipset drivers, LAN/Audio drivers updated\n- HAGS on/off, Game Mode on/off, MPO registry toggle tested\n- G-Sync fullscreen-only vs windowed+fullscreen; V-Sync off in-game, on in NVCP (also tried off/off)\n- Low Latency Mode on/off; pre-rendered frames 1/auto\n- Resizable BAR enabled\n- Windows power plan: AMD Balanced and High Performance (tested both)\n- C-States on/off in BIOS\n- HPET on/off (bcdedit + Device Manager)\n- Pagefile system-managed vs fixed\n- LatencyMon: occasional spikes tied to ndis.sys when on 2.5G Realtek LAN; less frequent on Wi-Fi\n- MemTest overnight no errors; sfc /scannow & DISM clean\n\nClues?\n- The ndis.sys spikes make me suspicious of the 2.5G Realtek LAN driver/firmware. Anyone fix stutters by rolling back to an older LAN driver or disabling EEE/Green Ethernet/Interrupt Moderation?\n- Could MSI mode/interrupts for the NIC or GPU help?\n- Any 5800X3D/X570 owners solve periodic frametime spikes with a specific BIOS setting (CPPC, Global C-State, Spread Spectrum, etc.)?\n- Is there a known W11 23H2 + G-Sync frametime issue that I missed?\n\nHappy to share logs/screens if needed. At this point it feels like a DPC/driver scheduling hiccup rather than raw performance. Any targeted fixes appreciated!\n subreddit: buildapc",
  "title: New 4070 + 5600X stutters like crazy (frametime spikes) — what am I missing?\n self_text: Upgraded from a GTX 1070 to an RTX 4070 two weeks ago and ever since I’m getting microstutters every 5–10 seconds in basically every game. Average FPS is good, but frametime spikes make it feel awful.\n\nWhat I’m seeing:\n- Warzone 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Apex, Valorant: high FPS but periodic hitches\n- GPU usage ~60–80%, CPU usage ~30–50%\n- VRAM 7–9 GB in heavier titles, system RAM 20–26 GB while gaming (9–11 GB at idle feels high?)\n- Temps fine: CPU 65–75C, GPU 60–68C (hotspot 80–85C)\n- Occasional audio crackles when the stutter hits\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n- DDU in safe mode, tried multiple Nvidia drivers (551.xx to 555.xx)\n- Disabled all overlays (GFE, Steam, Discord), HAGS on/off, Game Mode on/off, MPO off\n- G-Sync Compatible + NVCP FPS cap, tried V-Sync off/Adaptive\n- Fresh Windows install, latest AMD chipset drivers, High Perf/AMD Balanced power plans\n- BIOS updated (AGESA 1.2.0.8), SAM/ReBAR enabled/disabled (tested both)\n- XMP 3600 CL16 enabled (FCLK 1800), also tried 3200 CL16\n- GPU seated in top x16; GPU‑Z reports PCIe x16 3.0 under load\n- LatencyMon shows occasional spikes (ndis.sys, nvlddmkm.sys)\n- Disabled HPET, checked network drivers, tried different NIC\n\nWeird find:\n- CPU‑Z shows my memory is in SINGLE channel even though both sticks are in A2/B2. Reseated/swapped sticks, same result. Board posts fine, XMP loads, but still “Single” in CPU‑Z and Task Manager.\n\nSpecs:\n- CPU: Ryzen 5 5600X (stock, Scythe Fuma 2)\n- Mobo: MSI B450 Tomahawk MAX (BIOS 7C02v3A)\n- GPU: MSI RTX 4070 Ventus 2X (driver 555.99)\n- RAM: 32GB (2x16) Crucial Ballistix DDR4‑3600 CL16 (on QVL)\n- Storage: WD SN770 1TB (OS), MX500 1TB (games)\n- PSU: Corsair RM650x (2018)\n- Monitor: 1440p 165Hz G‑Sync Compatible\n\nQuestions:\n- Could single‑channel RAM alone cause these periodic stutters at 1440p (mostly GPU‑bound games)?\n- Is the RM650x potentially causing 4070 transient spikes/stutter (no shutdowns/brownouts though)?\n- Any B450 + 5600X folks run into ReBAR causing stutter? Worth leaving SAM off?\n- Any MSI Tomahawk MAX tricks to force dual‑channel if A2/B2 still shows Single? Bad slot/IMC?\n- BIOS toggles to try (Global C‑States, CPPC, PBO off, Spread Spectrum, Above 4G decoding combos)?\n\nI’m at my wits’ end—benchmarks look great but real gameplay hitches like clockwork.

  "title: 980 PRO stuck at PCIe 3.0 x1 speeds? Getting SATA-like numbers on NVMe\n self_text: New build, trying to figure out why my 980 PRO 1TB is benchmarking like a SATA drive. CrystalDiskMark is giving me ~350 MB/s read / ~320 MB/s write. HWInfo shows the drive link at PCIe 3.0 x1. Temps are fine (38–42C), so I don’t think it’s thermal throttling.  What I’ve tried: - Updated BIOS to latest - Installed latest AMD chipset drivers - Disabled CSM, enabled Above 4G Decoding/Resizable BAR - Reseated the NVMe, tried both with and without the motherboard heatsink - Samsung NVMe driver won’t install (says not supported on this device)  Board/slot details: - Motherboard: MSI B550 Tomahawk (non-Max) - NVMe currently in M2_2 (chipset lane). Manual says M2_1 (CPU lane) supports PCIe 4.0 x4, M2_2 is PCIe 3.0 x4. Even so, I should see ~3500 MB/s on 3.0 x4, not 350 MB/s. - GPU in top x16 slot, no risers - No SATA drives connected to the shared ports AFAIK  Specs: - Ryzen 5 5600X - 32GB (2x16) DDR4-3600 CL16 (XMP on) - RTX 3070 - EVGA 650W Gold - Windows 11 Pro 22H2  Questions: - Is there a BIOS setting that can force M.2 to x1 (bifurcation/laneshare) that I’m missing? - Could M2_2 be lane-starved if another device is occupying bandwidth, or should it still negotiate x4? - Anyone else seen Samsung’s NVMe driver refuse the 980 PRO on Win11? - Before I pull the GPU to move the drive to M2_1, is there anything else I should try/check?  Appreciate any ideas. This feels like a lane negotiation issue, but I’m not sure what’s forcing it to x1.\n subreddit: buildapc",
  "title: RAM stuck in single-channel + high idle usage, low FPS on 5800X + 3070 Ti — what am I missing?\n self_text: I’m losing my mind over this. Upgraded my RAM and now I’m seeing two weird issues and crappy FPS in games.  Specs: • CPU: Ryzen 7 5800X • GPU: RTX 3070 Ti (driver fresh install w/ DDU) • Mobo: MSI B550 Tomahawk • RAM: 32GB (2x16) DDR4-3600 CL16 (QVL) • Storage: 1TB NVMe + 2TB SATA • PSU: 750W Gold • Windows 11 (fully updated) • BIOS up to date, XMP enabled  Problems: • CPU-Z and Task Manager both show “Single-Channel” even though sticks are in A2/B2. I’ve reseated multiple times, tried A1/B1, swapped sticks, etc. Still single-channel. • Task Manager shows 70–85% memory usage at idle. No obvious process chewing RAM in Details tab. Pagefile is on default/auto. Memory Integrity is off.  Performance: • Warzone 2 ~60–70 FPS on medium 1080p, GPU at ~60–70% utilization, CPU ~30–40%. • Apex similar story, GPU never fully loaded. • RAM speed shows 1800 MHz (so 3600), timings correct, passes MemTest64 and TM5 1usmus test.  Things I’ve tried/checked: • CMOS reset • Reinstalled GPU drivers with DDU • Disabled iGPU/UMA (there isn’t one on 5800X but checked CSM/UMA Frame Buffer just in case) • Windows Clean Boot (still high memory usage) • Malware scan (nothing) • Turned off Xbox Game Bar/Overlay, HAGS on/off both tested • Disabled SysMain, Indexing (no change) • Speccy + CPU-Z confirm dual sticks detected, but “Single” channel • No WHEA errors in Event Viewer  Could this be: • A bent CPU pin affecting a memory channel? • A weird Windows Memory Compression bug (how do I verify/disable cleanly)? • A bad DIMM slot on the board? • Pagefile setting causing the “high usage” illusion?  Before I rip the cooler off to inspect pins: any other checks I should do? Also, would single-channel alone tank FPS this hard even when GPU/CPU aren’t maxed?

  "title: XMP makes my PC crash within minutes — did I buy the wrong RAM?\n self_text: Hey all, looking for sanity checks. I upgraded my RAM and ever since, enabling XMP makes my system super unstable. At stock JEDEC it’s fine.\n\nSpecs:\n- CPU: Ryzen 5 5600X (stock)\n- Mobo: MSI B550 Tomahawk (A-XMP capable, latest BIOS)\n- RAM: G.Skill Ripjaws V 32GB (2x16) 3600 CL16 (F4-3600C16D-32GVKC) – on my board’s QVL\n- GPU: RTX 3070\n- PSU: Corsair RM650x\n- OS: Win 11 Pro\n\nSymptoms:\n- With A-XMP on (3600 CL16, 1.35V, FCLK 1800), I get random reboots/BSOD within 5–20 mins in games (Warzone, Apex) and even browsing.\n- Event Viewer shows WHEA-Logger 18 (Cache Hierarchy Error) and sometimes Memory_Management.\n- MemTest86 throws errors within the first pass; HCI MemTest throws errors around 200–300% coverage.\n- With XMP off (defaults 2133), totally stable. At 3200 CL16 (manual, 1.35V, FCLK 1600) seems stable in short tests, but not 100% sure yet.\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n- Updated BIOS, cleared CMOS, re-seated sticks (A2/B2), tried A1/B1 for giggles.\n- DRAM voltage 1.35–1.38V, SOC 1.05–1.1V, ProcODT 36.9–48Ω, GDM on/off, PowerDown on/off.\n- Manually set 3600 with looser timings (CL18-22-22-42) still errors.\n- FCLK 1800 seems to be the wall — tried 1866/1900 but instant whea.\n- Tested each stick solo in A2: both fail at 3600, both pass at 3200.\n\nQuestions:\n- Is my 5600X just unhappy at 1800 FCLK and I should settle for 3200/CL16 (or 3600 with 2:1 UCLK/FCLK penalty)?\n- Worth pushing 3600 with tighter subtimings at 1:2, or is 3200/CL16 the “good enough” sweet spot on Ryzen?\n- Could this be a marginal kit and I should RMA even though it’s “QVL-approved”?\n- Any other BIOS knobs I should try (CAD_BUS, RTTs) before I give up on 3600?\n\nTemps are fine (CPU peaks ~70C in CB R23, RAM not hot to touch). Would love advice on whether to keep fighting for 3600 or lock 3200 and move on. Thanks!\n\n(subtle note: can drop screenshots of BIOS/Event Viewer/MemTest if that helps)\n subreddit: buildapc",
  "title: Severe stuttering after GPU upgrade (RX 6800 XT) — random 1–2s freezes, audio crackle, GPU usage drops to 0%\n self_text: Upgraded from an RX 570 to an RX 6800 XT a few weeks ago and ever since I’m getting hard stutters/hitches in pretty much every game (Apex, Cyberpunk, Warzone, even Hades). Every 20–60 seconds the game freezes for 1–2 seconds, audio crackles, and I see GPU usage flatline to 0% in RTSS/Afterburner before it recovers. Temps are fine (GPU ~70C, hotspot <90C, CPU <70C). FPS otherwise is great when it’s not hitching.  What I’ve tried so far:  - DDU in safe mode, fresh Adrenalin install (tried latest WHQL + one older driver) - Updated BIOS, AMD chipset drivers, Windows up to date - XMP enabled (tried disabled too), RAM passes memtest - ReBAR toggled on/off (Above 4G on/off), PCIe forced Gen3 vs Auto - HAGS on/off, MPO disabled via reg - Clean boot (no overlays), disabled Radeon overlay - Moved games to a different drive (NVMe -> SATA SSD) - Fresh Windows 11 install on a new NVMe (still happens) - Checked power (Seasonic Focus 650W Gold), separate 8-pins to the GPU, no daisy chain - LatencyMon flags dxgkrnl.sys and ndis.sys with occasional spikes during the stutter  Specs: R5 3600, MSI B450 Tomahawk MAX (latest BIOS), 32GB DDR4-3200 (2x16), RX 6800 XT (reference), WD SN570 1TB (OS), Crucial MX500 1TB (games), Seasonic Focus GX-650, Windows 11 23H2, 1440p 144Hz.  Could this be a PSU transient issue (650W not enough for 6800 XT spikes), a PCIe/latency problem on B450, or a NIC/driver DPC thing? Anyone fixed a similar “GPU usage to 0% + audio crackle” stutter after moving to a high-end card on Ryzen 3000/B450?

FPS is high, but frametime spikes every 10–30 seconds. Temps are fine (GPU ~65C, CPU ~60C), GPU usage fluctuates 60–95%, CPU 30–60%. G-Sync Compatible monitor, V-Sync off in-game, Reflex on where available. Fresh DDU install of drivers, latest chipset/BIOS, Windows up to date.\n\nSpecs:\n- i5-12600K (stock)\n- MSI B660 Tomahawk WiFi\n- 32GB (2x16) DDR4-3600 CL16\n- RTX 4070 (single 8-pin)\n- Seasonic Focus Plus Gold 550W (from 2019)\n- 1TB SN850, 2TB SATA SSD\n- Monitor: 1080p/144Hz G-Sync Compatible\n\nPower: I’ve got the 4070 on a single daisy-chained PCIe cable (same cable has two 6+2 ends). I can run a second dedicated PCIe cable if that matters. Do I actually need to step up to a 650–750W PSU, or is the 550W Focus Gold still fine for a 12600K + 4070? Could the daisy-chain be causing transient drops/stutters even if I’m not crashing?\n\nOther things to check? ReBAR is enabled, XMP on, no background overlays aside from GeForce (tried disabling), pagefile set to system managed. Happens in DX12 and Vulkan titles more noticeably. Any tips before I drop money on a new PSU?\n subreddit: buildapc",

  "title: 5600X hitting 95°C with 240mm AIO after case swap — normal or did I botch the install?\n self_text: After moving my rig into a new case and adding a 240 AIO, my 5600X is spiking to 95°C under Cinebench R23 and sits 80–85°C in heavier games. Idle is 50–55°C. Feels high for a 65W chip with an AIO, so I’m wondering if I goofed something.\n\nSpecs: Ryzen 5 5600X, Arctic Liquid Freezer II 240 (top-mounted as exhaust), Lian Li Lancool 215 (2x200mm front intake, 1x120 rear exhaust), 2x120 on the rad, RTX 3060 Ti, B550 Tomahawk, 32GB 3600 CL16, ambient ~22°C. Pump is on AIO_PUMP at 100%, rad fans on CPU_FAN. HWiNFO shows pump ~2300 RPM, fans scale to ~1600 RPM under load. PBO is “Auto” (I didn’t change CO). Vcore peaks ~1.45V single-core, ~1.30V all-core.\n\nWhat I’ve tried: reseated block twice (Kryonaut pea and X methods), removed the plastic film (yep), tightened in cross pattern, re-made fan curves, updated BIOS/chipset, fresh paste each time. Radiator is top with the ports/tubes at the front—so the tubes end up slightly “above” the pump. Can’t front-mount because of the 200mm fans.\n\nQuestions:\n- Are these temps normal for a 5600X with PBO on Auto + CB R23?\n- Could my top mount orientation be trapping air in the block (tubes higher than pump)? Worth flipping the rad so the ports are toward the rear?\n- Should I cap PPT/TDC/EDC or set a negative Curve Optimizer to bring temps down?\n- Any obvious cabling/header mistakes (e.g., should I put pump on CPU_FAN and fans on CPU_OPT instead)?\n\nAny guidance is appreciated. If needed I can grab HWiNFO logs and pics of the mount.\n subreddit: buildapc",
  "title: Microstutters every ~30s on new build (5600X + 3070) — losing my mind\n self_text: Built a new rig a few weeks ago and I’m getting consistent microstutters every ~20–40 seconds in multiple games (frame time spikes to 40–80ms for a split second). Average FPS is great, but it feels awful to play.  Specs: - CPU: Ryzen 5 5600X (stock, PBO off) - GPU: MSI RTX 3070 Ventus 3X (stock) - RAM: 32GB (2x16) DDR4-3600 CL16 (XMP on, dual channel confirmed) - Mobo: MSI B550 Tomahawk (latest BIOS) - Storage: WD SN750 1TB NVMe (OS + games), Crucial MX500 1TB SATA - PSU: Corsair RM750x - Display: 1440p 144Hz G-Sync Compatible (FreeSync) - OS: Windows 11 Pro (22H2 fully updated)  What I’m seeing: - Apex, Warzone 2, Cyberpunk, and even Valorant all run 120–200 FPS but stutter at the same interval-ish. - RTSS graph shows frametime spikes every half minute or so. - No obvious CPU/GPU usage spikes (GPU 70–90%, CPU 20–45%). - Temps are fine (CPU ~65–70C, GPU ~65C).  What I’ve tried: - DDU in safe mode → fresh NVIDIA driver (tried 536.xx and 537.xx). - Latest AMD chipset drivers, BIOS update (AGESA 1.2.0.x), Windows updates. - HAGS on/off, Game Mode on/off, NVCP Low Latency On/Off/Ultra. - G-Sync Compatible on/off, V-Sync off in-game/on in NVCP and vice versa. - Capping FPS to 141, 138, 120; tried uncapped too. - fTPM off (heard about the AMD fTPM stutter bug) — seemed to help slightly but not gone. - Forced PCIe to Gen3 in BIOS (no change). - MemTest86 4 passes (0 errors). - LatencyMon: occasional spikes from ACPI.sys and ndis.sys but “system appears suitable” most of the time. - Disabled background apps (Discord overlays, RGB, GeForce overlay), clean boot — still stutters. - Moved a game to SATA SSD to test NVMe — still happens. - Checked power: Windows AMD Balanced/High Performance, turned off USB selective suspend, set PCIe Link State to off.  At this point I’m out of ideas. Could this be: - LAN/Wi-Fi drivers (Intel I225-V weirdness)? - Audio drivers (Realtek) or sample rate mismatch? - PSU transients (seems unlikely)? - Some B550 BIOS setting I’m missing (CPPC, Global C-State, PBO/Eco Mode)? - Windows 11 quirk — worth trying Win10?  Any tips or known fixes I’m overlooking? Happy to post logs/screens if needed. Thanks in advance.\n subreddit: buildapc",
  "title: Sudden stutters and low FPS after upgrading to 5800X3D — did I mess up BIOS settings?\nself_text: Swapped my 3700X for a 5800X3D last week and my performance is worse in a bunch of games. I’m seeing frequent frametime spikes (micro-stutters every ~10–15 seconds) and overall lower FPS than before, despite the CPU upgrade.\n\nA few examples at 1440p:\n- Warzone: used to sit ~120–140 FPS high settings, now dips to 70–90 with random stutters. GPU usage hovers 60–70%.\n- Cyberpunk: previously ~85–100 FPS, now ~65–80 with spikes on camera turns.\n- Fortnite: similar story, lots of little hitches that weren’t there.\n\nWhat I’ve done so far:\n- Updated BIOS to latest AGESA that supports 5800X3D (loaded optimized defaults afterward).\n- Enabled DOCP/XMP 3600 CL16 (2x16GB). FCLK auto set to 1800, tried forcing 1800 and also 1600—no real change.\n- Chipset drivers updated (AMD 5.08).\n- DDU’d NVIDIA drivers, clean install current WHQL.\n- Windows Game Mode On, HAGS tried On/Off, VBS/Memory Integrity Off.\n- Checked temps: NH-D15, CPU peaks mid 80s in heavy loads, occasional spikes ~90C in Warzone, GPU ~65–70C.\n- PBO disabled (I know 5800X3D is picky), tried Auto as well; no CO applied.\n- ReBAR is off (3080).\n- SSDs have plenty of free space; pagefile system-managed.\n- Fresh CMOS clear done. No OC anywhere.\n\nOddities:\n- GPU isn’t fully utilized in CPU-heavy titles but CPU usage isn’t pegged either (Afterburner shows 15–35% overall, with a couple cores spiking).\n- Dual channel is enabled (A2/B2), CPU-Z shows DC, but Task Manager shows surprisingly high “in use” RAM during idle (like 8–10GB with nothing open beyond basics).\n- LatencyMon shows occasional DPC spikes from ndis.sys/acpi.sys.\n\nSpecs:\n- CPU: 5800X3D\n- Cooler: NH-D15\n- Mobo: MSI B450 Tomahawk MAX (latest BIOS)\n- RAM: 32GB (2x16) 3600 CL16 (DOCP)\n- GPU: RTX 3080 (MSI Gaming X Trio)\n- PSU: Seasonic Focus PX 850W\n- Storage: 1TB SN850 (OS), 2TB 970 EVO (games)\n- Windows 11 Pro 22H2\n\nQuestions:\n- Are there specific 5800X3D BIOS settings I should lock in (CPPC, Preferred Cores, Global C-States, PBO/ECO, FCLK/UCTL) to avoid stutter?\n- Is a clean Windows install recommended after a CPU swap on AM4? I avoided it but I’m considering it.\n- Could DOCP 3600/FCLK 1800 be causing instability even without WHEA errors? Should I try 3200/1600?\n- Any known MSI B450 Tomahawk quirks with 5800X3D I should toggle?\n- Anything else I’m missing that would explain the frametime spikes and low GPU usage?\n\nAppreciate any pointers. Kinda bummed that the “easy FPS win” chip is performing worse than my 3700X right now.\nsubreddit: buildapc",
  "title: 5800X3D spiking to 95C in games after upgrade — normal or did I mess up the mount?\nself_text: Swapped my old 2700X for a 5800X3D on my MSI B450 Tomahawk MAX (latest BIOS), and I’m a bit freaked out by temps. In Apex/Warzone/Cyberpunk I’m seeing 85–90C with frequent spikes to 95C and instant fan ramping. Cinebench R23 pegs 95C almost immediately and it seems to throttle a bit (scores around 14.5k). Idle sits 40–50C.\n\nSpecs:\n- CPU: Ryzen 7 5800X3D (stock)\n- Cooler: Arctic Freezer 34 eSports Duo (freshly cleaned)\n- Case: NZXT H510 (2x 120 front intake, 1x 120 rear exhaust)\n- GPU: RTX 3080 (70–72C while gaming)\n- RAM: 32GB 3200 CL16 (XMP on)\n- PSU: 750W Gold\n- Ambient: ~22C\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n- Re-seated cooler twice, pea/rice TIM application (Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut), even pressure\n- Cleaned dust filters, flipped top fan to exhaust, adjusted fan curves\n- PBO off/auto/on tested; curve optimizer -15 all cores (dropped a few C but still spikes)\n- Windows balanced vs high performance, nvidia power management normal\n- PPT/TDC/EDC limits tested (e.g., 120/80/120), minor improvement but still sees 90–95C spikes in CPU-heavy scenes\n\nPerformance is fine, but the constant spiking and noise are rough. Is this just “normal” 5800X3D behavior (I know they run hot), or is my cooler/case airflow just not enough? Should I:\n- Re-mount (again) or try different paste/pattern?\n- Cap PPT to something like 90–100W?\n- Upgrade the cooler (Peerless Assassin/AK620/Liquid AIO)?\n- Add more case airflow or ditch the H510?\n\nWould love to hear from other 5800X3D owners—what temps are you seeing in games, and what cooling/case are you using?\nsubreddit: buildapc",
  "title: Winston vs Kiriko/Ana backlines — am I inting by diving supports first?\n self_text: Came back after a long break (was Diamond in OW1, now hanging around Plat/Diamond). I’m trying to main Winston again and I keep getting stonewalled when I jump the backline. Typical enemy supports are Ana + Kiriko or Bap + Kiriko. I land, drop bubble, and they just peel each other—nade/Suzu/lamps/get boosted heals—and I either feed or have to bail with nothing gained. Meanwhile my team gets rolled by their tank because I’m not there.  Am I approaching this wrong? Should I be:  - Diving DPS first if they’re isolated instead of supports?  - Soft-diving to force out CDs (nade/Suzu/lamp) and then committing on the second jump?  - Holding bubble to cut LOS from the tank rather than dropping it on supports?  - Playing more off-angles/choke control and poking for primal instead of hard committing?  Also, any tips on timing dives with my DPS in ranked when comms are dead, and what cooldowns I should specifically track before going in? If someone can lay out a basic win condition checklist for Winston vs Kiriko/Ana comps, I’d really appreciate it.  Thanks!\n subreddit: OverwatchUniversity",
  "title: GPU stuck at PCIe x1 after moving my rig — tanks FPS, any ideas?\n self_text: I just moved apartments and ever since then my FPS has been all over the place. GPU usage is 40–60% in games that used to be smooth, and I’m seeing microstutters every few seconds. GPU‑Z shows my card linked at PCIe x1 1.1 at idle and only goes to x1 3.0 under load.

Sometimes my RAM sits oddly high at idle too.\n\nSpecs:\n- CPU: Ryzen 7 5800X3D\n- GPU: RTX 3080 10GB (MSI Gaming X Trio)\n- RAM: 32GB (2x16) DDR4-3600 CL16 (XMP/EXPO enabled)\n- Mobo: MSI B550 Tomahawk (latest BIOS)\n- Storage: 1TB WD SN850 (OS/games), 2TB SATA SSD\n- PSU: Corsair RM850x\n- Monitor: 1440p 144Hz G-Sync Compatible\n\nWhat I’m seeing:\n- Warzone 2: ~90–110 FPS on high at 1440p, but constant microhitching even when FPS is stable.\n- Apex: ~180 FPS cap but small hitch every few minutes.\n- Cyberpunk: 70–85 FPS (DLSS Quality, high), occasionally drops to 50 with a noticeable stutter.\n- GPU usage fluctuates 60–90% in Warzone; CPU ~20–40%. Temps fine (CPU ~70C, GPU ~72C). No throttle.\n- RAM usage sometimes 8–10GB at idle after boot, which seems high (could be RGB/mobo utilities?).\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n- DDU + clean install of latest NVIDIA drivers (also tried one older version).\n- Latest AMD chipset drivers + Windows updates.\n- BIOS updated; XMP on; RAM in A2/B2; Gear Down Mode auto; FCLK 1800.\n- ReBAR/SAM enabled, HAGS tried on/off (no clear difference), Game Mode on.\n- Power plan: AMD Balanced; also tried High Performance.\n- Disabled overlays (GeForce, Xbox, Discord), closed RGB apps (iCUE, Mystic Light).\n- LatencyMon shows occasional spikes (ACPI.sys / ndis.sys).\n- NVMe ~30% full; PCIe link shows x4 Gen4 for the SN850 and x16 for the GPU.\n- V-Sync off, G-Sync on (fullscreen only); tried RTSS cap at 141 — still get frametime spikes.\n- Fresh Windows install was done on this build.\n\nQuestions:\n- Could this be a memory timing/IF issue (3600 + 1800 FCLK) and I should try 3200/1600 for stability?\n- Any known B550 Tomahawk BIOS settings to tweak (CPPC, Global C-States, PBO on/off) that help frametimes on 5800X3D?\n- Is SAM actually helping here or should I disable it for these games?\n- Could a background service be causing DPC latency spikes (any usual culprits beyond RGB software)?\n- Anything obvious I’m overlooking (PCIe power, firmware for SN850, Nvidia control panel settings, etc.)?\n\nOpen to running specific tests (OCCT, MemTest, CapFrameX captures) if that helps pinpoint it. Appreciate any ideas — this setup should be smoother than my old 3700X/2070S but it just isn’t right now.\n subreddit: buildapc",

  "title: Sudden CPU temps/thermal throttling after moving my case — did I mess up my cooler mount?\nself_text: I just moved apartments and ever since re-setting my PC on the new desk my CPU temps have gone bonkers. It used to idle around 35–40C and hit ~70C in games. Now it idles at 55–60C and spikes to 95C+ instantly in Cinebench/Prime95, then hard-throttles to ~3.0 GHz. Games that were fine last week are stuttery and my fan curve is screaming.\n\nWhat changed: literally just transported the tower (carefully) in my car and plugged everything back in. No BIOS changes. Same room temp as before.\n\nWhat I’ve tried so far:\n- Blew out dust, reseated RAM and GPU, checked all fan headers spinning as expected\n- Verified case airflow direction (2x 200mm front intake, 1x 120mm rear exhaust, top open)\n- Reset BIOS to defaults (then re-enabled XMP), PBO is off, Vcore looks a bit higher at idle (~1.1V vs ~0.7–0.9V before)\n- Re-pasted once with MX-5 (pea), tightened cooler in an X-pattern until snug\n\nSymptoms that make me think mounting pressure/backplate is the issue:\n- Cooler has the slightest wiggle if I nudge it (it didn’t before)\n- One of the spring screws feels like it bottoms out earlier than the other\n- HWInfo shows cores spiking to TjMax within seconds even with a light load\n- GPU temps are totally normal (65–70C), so it doesn’t feel like a case airflow problem\n\nSpecs:\n- Ryzen 5 5600X\n- Cooler Master Hyper 212 Black (AM4 kit)\n- MSI B550 Tomahawk\n- 32GB DDR4-3600 (XMP on)\n- RTX 3060 Ti\n- Lian Li Lancool 215\n- RM750x\n\nQuestions:\n- Could the AM4 backplate or standoffs have shifted/bent during transport?

I’m getting a consistent microstutter every ~30–60 seconds in literally every game (Apex, Fortnite, Cyberpunk, Valheim, even older titles). It’s a sharp frametime spike (to ~120–200ms), a tiny audio crackle, then it’s smooth again until the next spike.\n\nWhat I see when it happens:\n- GPU usage drops to 0–5% for a split second, clocks dip, then recover\n- CPU package power/clock blips down at the exact same moment\n- No thermal throttling (CPU ≤72C, GPU ≤68C)\n- Happens offline, with/without network, windowed/fullscreen, VSync/VRR on or off\n\nSpecs:\n- i5-11400F (stock), B560M board (latest BIOS)\n- RX 6700 XT (no OC), driver clean-installed with DDU\n- 16GB (2x8) DDR4-3200 XMP (MemTest86 clean)\n- 1TB NVMe (OS/games), 650W Gold PSU\n- Windows 11 (22H2), fresh install last week\n\nThings I’ve tried:\n- DDU and fresh GPU driver; latest Intel chipset/MEI\n- BIOS update, XMP on/off, ReBAR on/off\n- HAGS on/off, Game Mode on/off, MPO disable, HW overlays off (Discord/Steam/MSI)\n- Different display cable/port; G-Sync Compatible/FreeSync off\n- High performance power plan, PCIe ASPM off\n- Moved games to different drive; pagefile system-managed\n- sfc /scannow, DISM restorehealth, LatencyMon ( borderline spikes, storport and dxgkrnl show up sometimes)\n- Unplugged all USB accessories but KB/mouse; tried another PSU cable for GPU\n\nEvent Viewer:\n- Repeating WHEA-Logger Event ID 17 “Corrected hardware error” on PCI Express Root Port occasionally lines up with a stutter\n\nQuestions:\n- Is this pointing at a flaky PCIe link (motherboard slot) or a GPU issue?\n- Anyone fix stutters tied to WHEA-17 without replacing hardware?\n- Any B560 + 6700 XT folks hit this and solve it with a specific BIOS/driver combo?\n\nI can record HWInfo/OCAT logs if that helps.

  "title: Stuck in C1 with super inconsistent aerials — what should my practice routine look like?\n self_text: Sitting around Champ 1 Div 2/3 in 2s and 3s (~500 hours). Mechanics feel fine in freeplay, but in ranked I panic-touch, whiff mid-speed aerials, and my recoveries are spaghetti. I’m looking for a concrete 30–45 min daily routine to actually fix this instead of just “play more.”  My issues: - Fast aerial form falls apart under pressure (I miss the second jump or I lean too hard and stall under the ball). - Backboard reads are coin flips; I either underjump or bang it away with zero control. - I land nose-first a lot and burn too much boost recovering. - Bad small-pad pathing → I starve myself in extended defense and end up hard-committing. - Half-flips are slow and inconsistent. - I struggle with controlled first touches off wall/sidewall to set a pass or solo play.  Current setup: - PC, DualSense (no paddles). Controller deadzone 0.05, dodge deadzone 0.65. Aerial/Steering sens 1.50/1.50. Aerial bindings: Air Roll Right on R1, Air Roll (hold) on L1. - Camera: 110 FOV, -5 height, 270 distance, -3 angle, 0.40 stiffness. - Training I do now: Freeplay, rings maps (sometimes), Aerial Shots – Rebound (All-Star), and a couple redirect packs.  Questions: - What exact packs/workshop maps should I run daily for: fast aerials under pressure, backward aerials, backboard reads, controlled first touch, half-flips, and recoveries? If you have code names/links, I’ll save them. - Should I drop aerial sensitivity a bit (to like 1.30) to stop over-correcting, or is this a “fix form, not settings” problem? - Any drills to ingrain wheels-first landings and better boost discipline (like specific small pad circuits)? - Would you recommend swapping to dedicated Air Roll Left/Right on both bumpers and ditching hold Air Roll entirely at my level? - Is grinding 1s actually the fastest way to fix my panic touches and boost management, or should I stick to targeted drills + 2s?  Bonus: If anyone’s got a C1 → C2 practice checklist (e.g., 10 min recoveries, 10 min backboard reads, 10 min first-touch control, etc.), I’d love to steal it. Coaching video/channel recs also appreciated. Thanks!\n subreddit: RocketLeague",
  "title: Micro-stutters after upgrading to 5800X3D + 4070 Ti — what am I missing?\n self_text: Upgraded a few weeks ago and my average FPS is great, but I’m getting constant micro-stutters (frametime spikes) across multiple games.

What I’ve tried: - DDU in safe mode, clean NVIDIA driver install (536.xx and 552.xx) - Latest BIOS (AGESA 1.2.0.B), chipset drivers, Windows 11 23H2 fully updated - EXPO enabled (also tried off), RAM tested with TM5/karhu (no errors) - HAGS on/off, Game Mode on/off, ReBar on/off, MPO registry tweak - NVCP: Low Latency Off/On/Ultra tested, V-Sync off, G-Sync on (also tested off), max frame cap at 162 for my 165Hz panel - Windows High Performance/AMD Balanced plans, USB selective suspend off - Fresh install of Warzone/Apex on NVMe (moved off SATA SSD) - Disabled overlays (Steam, Discord, GeForce), Xbox Game Bar, DVR - fTPM stutter fix supposedly in this BIOS, tried toggling fTPM anyway - Checked temps (CPU <75C, GPU <70C), no throttling - Event Viewer is clean; no disk, WHEA, or nvlddmkm spam  Observations: - HWInfo + RTSS shows frametime spikes when nothing obvious changes (GPU 70–85% load, CPU 10–30% per core, VRAM fine) - Doesn’t look like shader compilation; persists after multiple launches - Pagefile is system-managed on C: (NVMe); tried fixed size 16–32GB, no change - Disabling HPET didn’t help; LatencyMon looks OK; no DPC outliers - Stutter still happens in borderless and fullscreen, with and without G-Sync - 3DMark runs smooth, Cinebench/OCCT stable  Specs: - CPU: Ryzen 7 5800X3D (stock) - Cooler: NH-D15 - Mobo: MSI B550 Tomahawk (latest BIOS) - RAM: 32GB (2x16) DDR4 3600 CL16 (EXPO) - GPU: RTX 4070 Ti (stock) - Storage: 1TB SN850X (OS), 2TB SN770 (Games), 1TB SATA SSD (old) - PSU: RM750x - Display: 1440p 165Hz G-Sync Compatible  This feels like a scheduling/latency/config thing rather than raw performance. Anyone on 5800X3D + 40-series run into this and fix it? Should I: - Force “Prefer AMD CPPC”/disable Global C-states? - Cap FPS to 141 (VRR headroom) instead of 162? - Turn on NVIDIA Reflex in-game and set NVCP Low Latency to Off? - Reinstall chipset with “power” options unchecked?

I’m in the top full‑length slot, but I am using a cheap vertical mount/riser (PCIe 3.0). Could the riser be forcing x4 and choking the card?\n- RAM is definitely single‑channel despite XMP being on. Did I mess up slot placement, or is there a BIOS setting I’m missing? Do these MSI boards care about very specific slots for dual channel?\n\nQuestions:\n1) Would running the 3070 Ti at PCIe 3.0 x4 explain the low utilization and big FPS dips at 1440p?\n2) Any trick to get dual channel to actually engage on B550?

Symptoms: - Warzone ~70–90 FPS on medium, Apex ~110 with hitching, Cyberpunk ~60–70 (no RT), frametimes look like a seismograph - CPU usage ~30–50%, GPU ~60–75% during games (never pegs 99%) - Task Manager memory sits 70–85% at idle sometimes, and “Hardware Reserved” randomly shows ~16 GB - CPU-Z reports Single Channel, not Dual, even with sticks in A2/B2 - XMP enabled (Profile 1), BIOS/Chipset/Windows all up to date  Specs: - CPU: i5-12400F (stock) - GPU: RX 6700 XT (Sapphire Pulse) - Mobo: MSI B660M Mortar WiFi DDR4 - RAM: 32 GB (2x16) Corsair Vengeance LPX 3600 C18 (QVL: CMK32GX4M2D3600C18) - Storage: WD SN850 1TB (OS), SATA SSD for games - PSU: Corsair RM750x - Monitor: 1440p 144 Hz - OS: Windows 11 Pro (23H2)  What I’ve tried: - DDU in Safe Mode + fresh Adrenalin install - Latest Intel ME/chipset drivers - BIOS updated (7D42v1A) + CMOS clear - Re-seated RAM multiple times, tried A2/B2 and B2/A2, swapped sticks, tried 1 stick at a time - Disabled iGPU / ReBAR toggles - XMP on/off (no change, just slower without XMP) - Checked temps (all fine) and power limits  Questions: - Could this be a bad DIMM or memory controller if CPU-Z refuses to show dual channel? - Is there some MSI Mortar quirk to enable dual-channel I’m missing? - Any known W11 “hardware reserved” memory bugs causing half my RAM to vanish? - Did I buy the wrong RAM even though it’s on QVL?  I can post HWInfo64/CPU-Z/Speccy screenshots if needed. Before I RMA anything, would love advice on what to try next. Thanks! \n subreddit: buildapc",
  "title: Massive frametime spikes after swapping to 5800X3D on B450 — what am I missing?\n self_text: - Specs: 5800X3D, MSI B450 Tomahawk Max (latest beta BIOS with AGESA 1.2.0.8), RTX 3080 (MSI Gaming X Trio), 32GB (2x16) DDR4-3600 CL16 (XMP on), 1TB SN850 (OS), 2TB 970 EVO (games), Corsair RM650x, Win 11 Pro.\n- Symptoms: Raw FPS is good but constant micro-stutter and 1% lows tank in Warzone 2, Apex, and Cyberpunk. Frametimes spike to 40–60ms every ~10–30 seconds. Temps are fine (CPU 70–75C, GPU 65C), utilization looks normal.\n- What I tried: DDU + clean 527.xx, latest chipset driver, BIOS reset, PBO off, CPPC on, fTPM on/off, Game Mode on, HAGS on/off, MPO disabled, HPET on/off, XMP 3600/3200/auto, SAM on/off, G-Sync on (fullscreen+windowed), V-Sync off in NVCP, power plan set to AMD Balanced/High Perf, LatencyMon shows spikes from ndis.sys and storport.sys during stutters, NIC driver updated, LAN vs Wi‑Fi no change, background apps trimmed (no RGB bloat), fresh Win 11 install (also tried Win 10 on spare SSD).\n- Oddities: RAM sometimes boots at 2133 unless I re-enable XMP after cold boot. fTPM stutter “fix” BIOS is supposedly included, but behavior feels like the fTPM bug.\n- Questions: Is B450 + 5800X3D still finicky? Any MSI-specific BIOS settings I should flip (PSS support, Global C‑States, “Kombo Strike”, Curve Optimizer)? Safer AGESA to roll back to? Could the RM650x be borderline for transient spikes on a 3080 + 5800X3D? Any known NIC/NDIS issues with Intel I211 on this board? Would locking RAM to 3200 with tighter timings help vs 3600?\n- Logs/screens I can share if needed (frametime graphs, LatencyMon, BIOS screens).\n\nWould really appreciate any ideas before I start swapping PSU/mobo.

Since then I’ve had really inconsistent FPS and stutter in modern games. What’s weird is Task Manager shows Memory running single‑channel and I’m also seeing 80–90% RAM usage while essentially idle.\n\nWhat I expect:\n- 120+ FPS at 1440p High in titles like Warzone 2 / Apex with RT off\n- Dual‑channel memory @ 3600 MT/s (XMP)\n\nWhat I’m getting:\n- 60–80 FPS with random drops into the 40s, even on Medium\n- CPU and GPU both hovering 40–70% usage during drops\n- Memory pegged high at desktop (no heavy apps open)\n- Task Manager says “Channel: Single” even though sticks are in A2/B2 and XMP is ON\n\nSpecs:\n- CPU: Ryzen 5 5600X (stock, PBO off)\n- Cooler: Peerless Assassin 120\n- GPU: RTX 3080 10GB (latest driver, clean installed with DDU)\n- Mobo: MSI B550 Tomahawk (latest BIOS flashed, CMOS cleared)\n- RAM: 32GB (2x16) DDR4‑3600 CL16 (QVL‑listed)\n- Storage: 1TB NVMe (OS) + 2TB SATA SSD\n- PSU: Seasonic Focus GX 750W\n- Monitor: 1440p 144Hz (DP)\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n- Reseated RAM several times, tested A2/B2 and A1/B1\n- XMP enabled (shows 3600 MT/s in BIOS, CPU‑Z reads ~1800 MHz)\n- Fresh Windows install last week\n- DDU + clean GPU driver install\n- Disabled all RGB/control bloat (iCUE, Armoury Crate, etc.)\n- MemTest86 overnight: 0 errors\n- LatencyMon shows occasional spikes but nothing crazy\n- Checked Background apps / Startup — nothing obvious chewing RAM\n\nQuestions:\n1) Why would Windows show single‑channel if the board and CPU‑Z see both DIMMs? Is there any MSI BIOS quirk I’m missing?\n2) Could FCLK mismatch be causing stutter? I left it Auto — should I set FCLK 1800 manually for 1:1?\n3) Any known issues where MSI boards fall back to single channel due to a bent pin or dirty slot?\n4) Ideas for tracking down the idle RAM usage?

What’s weirder: Task Manager shows 70–90% memory usage at idle sometimes, and CPU‑Z reports Single Channel even though I installed both sticks in A2/B2 and enabled XMP. XMP loads, but CPU‑Z sometimes shows 2133 MHz instead of 3600. I updated BIOS, chipset, GPU drivers (DDU clean), and Windows. Still the same.  Things I’ve tried: reseated RAM, swapped sticks/slots, cleared CMOS, disabled any RAM “training”/auto OC in BIOS, checked for background apps/services, scanned for malware, turned off HAGS and Game Mode, fresh NVIDIA driver with only core components.  Could this be:  - A bad DIMM/slot causing single channel?  - Windows memory leak (Fresh install needed?)  - M.2 lane sharing forcing GPU down?

  "title: NVMe SSD disappears after sleep — RMA or BIOS/driver fix?\n self_text: My WD SN850X (1TB) randomly vanishes from Windows after the PC wakes from sleep/hibernate. It’s fine on a cold boot, runs fast, passes SMART, and temps are good (stays under 60C). But after sleep it’s just… gone. Disk Management doesn’t see it, Event Viewer throws “Disk has been surprise removed,” and only a full shutdown (not restart) brings it back.  What I’ve tried: updated BIOS and AMD chipset drivers, disabled Fast Startup, set PCIe Link State Power Management to Off, tried different M.2 slots (both CPU and chipset lanes), reseated with/without the heatsink, swapped NVMe driver (MS inbox vs WD dashboard), disabled hibernate, and tested the drive in a USB enclosure (no issues there).

It feels like a hitch rather than a drop — graphs look like sawteeth. Didn’t have this on the 3700X.\n\nWhat I did:\n- Flashed to latest BIOS (AGESA 1.2.0.7), cleared CMOS, then enabled DOCP/XMP (3600 CL16), set FCLK 1800. PBO/CO are left on Auto (no manual CO).\n- Fresh AMD chipset drivers, DDU’d Nvidia and clean-installed 537.xx.\n- Windows 11, Game Mode on, HAGS on (also tried off), Nvidia low-latency on Ultra (also tried Off/On).\n- ReBAR is enabled in BIOS and shows “On” in NVCP.\n\nTemps/Power:\n- CB23 all-core: 85–88C with a 240mm AIO (Arctic LF II), PPT ~90–100W (board locks X3D anyway), vcore spikes up to ~1.38–1.4V.\n- In-game: CPU sits ~75–80C, GPU ~68–72C, no thermal throttling flags in HWiNFO. No WHEA errors either.\n\nOther notes:\n- RAM passes 1 hour TM5 1usmus but I haven’t done an overnight. Should I just try 3200/Auto to rule out FCLK instability?\n- Stutter happens even on low settings and even when CPU/GPU aren’t near 100%.\n- Games on a Gen3 NVMe (SN550) with 20% free. Disk usage isn’t pegged when the hitch hits.\n- Nvidia shader cache set to default.

I get smooth 120–180 FPS in most games, but every ~10–20 seconds there’s a tiny hitch/micro-stutter (frame time spike) that you can feel and see in the frametime graph. Happens in Warzone, Apex, Cyberpunk, even in some game menus. It’s not a huge FPS drop—just that split-second hitch that ruins the feel.\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n- DDU-cleaned GPU drivers (several versions) and chipset drivers\n- BIOS update (AGESA 1.2.0.8), CMOS reset, XMP on/off, manual RAM tuning\n- HAGS on/off, ReBar on/off, V-Sync/Adaptive/G-Sync tests, Fullscreen optimizations off\n- Power plan set to High Perf/AMD Balanced, Game Bar/Game DVR disabled\n- LatencyMon shows occasional spikes (ndis.sys / Wdf01000.sys sometimes)\n- Pagefile fixed size, tested with/without OC/UV on GPU/CPU (stock now)\n- Checked temps (CPU ~65C, GPU ~70C, no throttling)\n- NVMe has plenty of free space, SMART fine, moved games to SATA SSD to test\n- Clean Windows 11 install last month\n- Tried different USB ports, 1000Hz vs 500Hz mouse polling, WLAN off (Ethernet only)\n\nSpecs:\n- CPU: Ryzen 5 5600X (stock, PBO off)\n- Cooler: NH-D15\n- GPU: RX 6800 XT (reference, stock)\n- RAM: 32GB (2x16) DDR4-3600 CL16 (runs 1800 FCLK 1:1:1 stable in TM5)\n- Mobo: MSI B550 Tomahawk (latest BIOS)\n- Storage: 1TB SN850 (OS), 2TB 970 EVO+ (games)\n- PSU: Seasonic Focus GX-750\n- Monitor: 1440p 165Hz FreeSync Premium (VRR on)\n- OS: Windows 11 Pro (TPM enabled)\n\nWeird clues:\n- Frametime spikes line up even in offline games; sometimes the graph shows a periodic spike pattern.\n- Disabling network adapter in Device Manager reduces (but doesn’t fully remove) spikes.\n- fTPM bug? I know older AGESA had stutter issues when fTPM is on for Win 11. I’m on 1.2.0.8—shouldn’t that be fixed? Anyone still seeing this unless fTPM is disabled?\n- Could it be PCIe lane sharing? One M.2 is under the GPU—GPU reports x16 4.0 in GPU-Z though.\n- USB polling/interrupts? Any known issues with this board?\n\nWhat else should I try?\n- Fully disable TPM/fTPM as a test (accepting the Win 11 warning)?\n- Lock FCLK to 1800 with tighter SoC/VDDG/VDDP voltages?\n- NIC driver rollback or use an Intel PCIe NIC to bypass Realtek?\n- HPET forced on/off?\n- BIOS: disable CPPC/Global C-states? Any specific 5600X settings that helped you kill periodic stutters?\n\nAppreciate any ideas.

Also tried 3200 MT/s and 3466 MT/s (Auto timings), Gear Down Mode on/off, SOC 1.05–1.1V — no change.\n- LatencyMon shows occasional spikes (nvlddmkm.sys, dxgkrnl.sys, ntoskrnl.exe) but nothing constant.\n- Disabled background apps (Discord overlay, Steam overlay, GeForce overlay, RGB software), killed NZXT CAM/Corsair iCUE — still stutters.\n- Pagefile set system managed, also tried fixed 16–32 GB.\n- Moved games to different drive; checked NVMe health.\n- Ethernet vs Wi-Fi; offline testing (no change).\n\nWeird bits:\n- If I cap well below refresh (like 100 on a 144Hz panel), stutters are slightly less obvious but still there.\n- Stutter is cross-title and not network dependent.\n- Feels like DPC latency/driver issue or something with B450 + 5800X3D scheduling? Or is my board just not happy with 5800X3D/4070 combo?\n\nQuestions:\n- Anyone with 5800X3D on B450 see similar periodic hitches? Did moving to B550/X570 actually fix it?\n- Is there a known 40-series + Win11 + MPO/Latency combo fix that actually sticks?\n- Any specific MSI Tomahawk MAX BIOS settings I should flip (CPPC, Global C-States, Spread Spectrum, PCIe Gen forcing, ASPM, Above 4G, MSI USB legacy quirks)?\n- Would forcing PCIe Gen3 on GPU help? (Tried Gen4 Auto/Gen3 force — no change so far.)\n- Could RGB controllers/AIO USB polling really cause this? I’ve unplugged most, but can test more.\n\nI’ll happily post logs (HWInfo CSV, LatencyMon, CapFrameX captures) if that helps. At this point I just want smooth 1% lows. Appreciate any pointers.\n\nsubreddit: buildapc",
  "title: Micro-stutters after GPU upgrade, frametime spikes every 10–15s — what am I missing?\n self_text: Swapped my GPU last week and ever since I’ve been getting really annoying micro-stutters in pretty much every game. FPS is “fine” (120–180) but frametime spikes to 40–60ms every ~10–15 seconds and it’s super noticeable.\n\nWhat I did:\n- DDU in safe mode, clean install latest NVIDIA drivers\n- Fresh chipset/LAN/Audio drivers from MSI\n- BIOS updated (but not 100% sure if it’s the newest AGESA)\n- XMP enabled (3600 CL16), verified dual channel\n- ReBAR enabled\n- G-Sync Compatible ON (LG 1440p 144Hz), V-Sync OFF in-game, ON in NVCP (tried every combo)\n- Tried RTSS cap at 141, 117, and in-game caps — stutter persists\n- Windows 11 Game Mode ON, HAGS tried both ON/OFF\n- Background stuff killed (Discord overlay, GeForce overlay, Chrome, OneDrive pause)\n\nSpecs:\n- CPU: Ryzen 5 5600X (stock), fTPM ON (default)\n- GPU: RTX 4070 (replaced a GTX 1660 Super)\n- Mobo: MSI B550 Tomahawk\n- RAM: 32GB (2x16) DDR4-3600 CL16 (dual channel)\n- Storage: 1TB NVMe (OS), 2TB SATA SSD (Games)\n- PSU: Corsair CX550M (550W Bronze)\n- Display: 27\" 1440p 144Hz (G-Sync Compatible)\n\nTemps/usage while stutter happens:\n- CPU 55–70C, 20–45% usage\n- GPU 60–67C, 50–80% usage\n- RAM ~9–12GB used\n- No obvious disk spikes (but I did see “System” hit the NVMe briefly a couple times)\n\nTried games:\n- Apex, Warzone, Cyberpunk, OW2, Elden Ring — all fine FPS, same rhythmic hitching\n- LatencyMon flags ndis.sys/DPC occasionally, but nothing red after a few minutes\n- CapFrameX clearly shows the frametime spikes matching the stutters\n\nCould this be:\n- fTPM/AGESA stutter (do I need a newer BIOS to fix the AMD fTPM hitching)?\n- PSU borderline for transient spikes on 4070? (no crashes, just stutters)\n- NVMe power management/PCIe ASPM issue? (any BIOS/Windows setting I should try)\n- G-Sync/V-Sync/Reflex combo mismatch? What’s the “known-good” setup for 144Hz?\n- NIC/driver causing DPC spikes (Realtek vs Intel)? Any known bad drivers to avoid?\n\nAny help appreciated — I’m chasing my tail at this point. If you want me to run a specific test (CapFrameX trace, LatencyMon for X mins, Event Viewer checks), I can post results. Thanks!\n subreddit: buildapc"
