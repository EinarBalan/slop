Been doing water tests religiously for almost three weeks now and I'm STILL bouncing between ammonia & nitrite spikes. I thought I was being patient letting it run with just a bit of pure ammonia but‚Ä¶it feels like it's taking FOREVER. I've got sponge filters, some java moss, and a couple anubias attached to driftwood. \n\nAnyone have any pro-tips for speeding things up? Specifically, what kind of bacteria booster actually works (I‚Äôm skeptical of all the marketing hype)? And are there certain plants that are particularly good at absorbing nitrates during the cycle? My betta is currently chilling in his temporary holding container judging me, and I want to get him settled ASAP! Also, source recommendations for reliably healthy shrimp are appreciated - don't wanna start with duds. Thanks in advance!",

I have a single male betta, a handful of cherry shrimp, and some java fern/anubias. He flares at his own reflection, which I figured was just typical betta being dramatic, but lately he‚Äôs also been aggressively flaring AT THE SHRIMP. They seem to be avoiding him pretty well, but it feels‚Ä¶ stressful for everyone involved? Is this just territoriality extending to anything that moves, or am I missing something? Water parameters are good, temp is stable around 78F. Any advice from experienced betta keepers would be hugely appreciated! I‚Äôm kinda worried he'll actually try to eat them.",

    "self_text": "Okay, so I *finally* got my little 5.5 gallon cycled and planted (Java fern, anubias, some dwarf sag ‚Äì super beginner friendly stuff!). Added Barnaby, my beautiful blue betta, yesterday. He seems happy enough exploring, but he spends like‚Ä¶ 80% of his time flaring at the glass. I know they see their reflection, but it feels excessive? Is this just him establishing dominance over ‚Äúintruders‚Äù or is something stressing him out? I tried adding more plants for cover, but he still goes full puffed-up warrior mode every few minutes. Any advice from experienced betta keepers would be massively appreciated before I start panicking about his well-being! Also, is there any way to tell if it's actual stress versus just normal territoriality?",

    "self_text": "Okay, so I *think* my cycle is fully established ‚Äì ammonia & nitrite consistently at 0, nitrate under 20ppm, regular water changes with dechlorinated water matched for temp‚Ä¶ but my new betta, Cosmo, is showing early signs of fin rot. Like, just a little frayed edges on his caudal fin, nothing dramatic YET. I‚Äôve been doing daily spot treatments with API Stress Coat + extra frequent small water changes (like 10% every other day) but it‚Äôs not improving. Plants are healthy, no sharp decorations he could be tearing himself on. He's eating well, acting normal otherwise. Any weird things *you've* experienced or solutions that worked when everything LOOKED good on paper? I feel like I‚Äôm missing something obvious!
