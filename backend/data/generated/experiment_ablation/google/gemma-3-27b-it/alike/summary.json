Drivers are up to date. Anyone else experiencing similar stuttering or inconsistent framerates? Any specific settings tweaks that helped smooth things out? Thinking about trying different DLSS presets but wanted to see if anyone has found a more comprehensive fix. Is it just CDPR needing to further optimize?

I *also* run a 34” ultrawide 1080p secondary monitor for Discord/browsing while gaming. \n\nI'm seeing mixed reviews – some say the performance uplift isn't worth the cost if you already have a 3070 Ti, others are saying DLSS 3 frame generation makes a huge difference. My PSU is 750W, so power isn't *immediately* a concern but I don't want to be cutting it close. Temps aren’t terrible on my current setup, but I do repaste every year or so. \n\nAnyone who made a similar upgrade recently – what’s your take? Is the jump noticeable enough to justify the expense, especially considering I'm not pushing 4K? And more importantly, does anyone else find themselves constantly tweaking fan curves to get optimal temp/noise balance?
