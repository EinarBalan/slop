The biggest issue for me is that there are so many things wrong with the game now, it would take an army of developers to fix all the issues and even then some people will still complain. It's also clear to me that the developers don't care about the quality of their own game anymore. They're more interested in getting money from players through microtransactions and making them feel bad about themselves so they spend more money on the game. I'm not saying that the game is completely unplayable or anything, but I'm just tired of dealing with the constant bugs, glitches, and imbalances. There are plenty of other games out there that I can play and enjoy without having to worry about any of these things. So yeah, I think I'm finally done with the game.

We decided early on that we would both contribute to mortgage payments equally as well as all other expenses related to the house (taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance) and that it was her job to be responsible for interior design/decorating etc..  She's recently started complaining that she feels like our financial situation isn't fair because she doesn't work. She says that while she does pay half the mortgage payment and bills she doesn't feel like it is equal since she has no income coming into the house. Now I don't mind covering more than half but she wants me to change everything around to make sure it is completely 100% fair and she feels like an equal contributor.  I've tried explaining to her that it isn't just about paying the bills when you own a house but also taking care of things like lawncare, appliance repair, etc... and if she did something for a business or side hustle that could potentially cover those costs then it wouldn't matter so much how much money she made. But she doesn't want to hear any of that and insists that being financially independent will give her peace of mind.  Now I want to support her in whatever goals she may have and help her become financially secure but I don't think giving up control over my finances or changing the existing system is the right answer. I do see what she's saying though and I can understand why she would feel insecure without her own source of income.  How do I approach this conversation and get her to see where I'm coming from?

I think that there are a few reasons why game streaming is still not as popular as traditional gaming. One reason is that the technology is not quite there yet. Game streaming requires a very fast and reliable internet connection, which many people do not have. Another reason is that game streaming can be expensive. Most game streaming services charge a monthly fee, which can add up over time.  However, I think that game streaming has the potential to revolutionize the way we play games. If the technology improves and the price comes down, I think that game streaming could become the dominant way to play games in the future. What do you guys think about the future of game streaming?

For example, the AI traffic is still a bit lacking, and the weather system could use some work.
