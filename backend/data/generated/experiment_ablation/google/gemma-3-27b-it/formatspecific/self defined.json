He says she “phases” sometimes and once brought back a Roman coin (which could just be from eBay, honestly). Today he told me Mittens warned him not to invest in Betamax. BETAMAX! He then spent twenty minutes explaining how Mittens keeps trying to prevent the invention of Crocs. I tried to politely change the subject to lawn care but he launched into a detailed account of Mittens allegedly attending Woodstock. Is *he* okay? Or am *I* going crazy hearing about a feline temporal agent? Send help (and maybe earplugs).",

    "self_text": "Okay, so this has been going on for about three weeks now. Old Man Hemlock next door *loves* pigeons. Like, REALLY loves them. He’s got like, fifty just hanging around his yard. And he's decided my collection of garden gnomes is… lacking pigeon companionship. Every morning he shows up with a different pigeon in a little cardboard box, attempting a trade. \"Bartholomew here needs a good home! He appreciates a well-painted hat!\" or “Penelope is a champion cooer, she’d LOVE your fisherman gnome!” I’ve politely declined every time. I do not want more pigeons. I barely tolerate the ones already pooping on my car. He seems genuinely hurt each time. Today he offered me THREE pigeons for my solar-powered flamingo. Is it rude of me to refuse? Do I need to just accept a pigeon and end this madness? Help.",

    "self_text": "Okay, so Mr. Henderson next door… he’s always been a bit eccentric. But lately it's escalated. He’s rearranged all twelve of his garden gnomes around my property line, facing *my* house. When I asked him about it, he whispered, “They’re observing. Gathering intel.” Apparently, they’re investigating a string of missing birdseed from feeders in the neighborhood. He gave each gnome a name and a \"specialty\" – Bartholomew handles surveillance, Agnes is an expert interrogator (of squirrels, apparently), and Reginald specializes in “disguise” (he just puts a tiny hat on one). He genuinely believes these ceramic figurines are solving crimes. I tried to politely suggest maybe raccoons were responsible for the birdseed, but he just glared at me and said, “Raccoons don’t operate with such precision.” I'm starting to feel like I need to start leaving out decoy birdseed or something. Is this normal neighborly weirdness, or am I slowly descending into madness along with him? Should I call someone? Or just embrace the gnome-based espionage?",

    "self_text": "Okay, so Mr. Henderson next door… he’s a nice guy, really. Bit eccentric. He collects geodes. Like, *a lot* of geodes. For the past month, every time I go outside, he tries to offer me a geode in exchange for “just listening.” Apparently his wife doesn't want to hear about his rock polishing techniques anymore. Yesterday it was a particularly sparkly amethyst in exchange for 15 minutes of my time while he described the different types of hammers used for cracking them open. I politely declined, but he just keeps coming back with bigger and more colorful rocks. I feel bad, but I have things to do! And honestly, my apartment is starting to look like a geological exhibit. AITA for not wanting to provide free therapy in exchange for petrified mud bubbles?",

    "self_text": "Okay, so Mr. Henderson next door… he *really* believes his Persian cat, Mittens, was a highly decorated Navy SEAL. He tells me detailed (and increasingly bizarre) stories about her missions – apparently she specialized in underwater demolition and once single-handedly disabled a North Korean submarine with a hairball. He even makes her wear tiny dog tags. Today he tried to explain how her kneading motion is actually “reconnaissance pattern memorization.” I just nodded and backed away slowly while holding my groceries. Is this normal neighbor behavior? Should I be concerned? Do I need to start leaving out small tributes of tuna for \"her service\"? Help.",

She just naps in sunbeams while Mr. Henderson whispers about classified intel. I tried politely suggesting maybe he’s projecting, but he just glared and said, “You wouldn’t understand the burdens of a warrior.” Is this normal neighbor behavior? Should I stage an intervention for Mittens? I'm starting to think *I'm* the crazy one for questioning a feline veteran.",
