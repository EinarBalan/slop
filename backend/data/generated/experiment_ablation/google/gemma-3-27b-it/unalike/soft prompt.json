    "self_text": "As someone who has been on both sides of this equation, and as someone who talks to people all day long, I can tell you that it's almost always something they said that made the other person want to get off their high horse.  If he was trying to push boundaries or disrespect her by talking about his exes, then I can see why she would have walked away. But if she started with an attack like \"I don't date guys who are still hung up on their ex\" than she just came across too harsh and defensive right out of the gate.   The truth is that a lot of guys (and girls) do talk about their past relationships in dating and that doesn't necessarily mean they aren't over them. It could be they were simply asked about it, or perhaps they were just making conversation. And if so, then there's really no need for the other person to jump down their throat at first sight.   Now, maybe he should have known better but it's not always easy to read someone when you barely know them. Maybe she thought he was being disrespectful, but it was only because she didn't know him well enough yet.  A little bit of understanding goes a long way.   And ultimately, it's not anyone else's place to decide how much someone wants to share about themselves. So it's important to respect everyone's privacy.   But yeah, I bet it was something she said...  Edit:  Also, yes, I am aware that I sound like a relationship guru here.

We were going to get engaged this fall but I realized that I didn‚Äôt want to spend my whole life with someone who doesn‚Äôt see how much pain they inflict on others.   He was upset about the breakup but quickly moved on by dating another woman who works with him. It‚Äôs been less than two weeks since the breakup and already he‚Äôs posting photos of them all over social media. It makes me sick.   But here‚Äôs where it gets really bad. Yesterday I received a text from his daughter saying ‚ÄúI miss you‚Äù and when I replied she said ‚ÄúDaddy says you don‚Äôt love us anymore.‚Äù  That breaks my heart. I haven‚Äôt done anything wrong! I still care about her very deeply. But I can tell my ex is trying to use her to manipulate me into getting back with him. How do I deal with this situation? Should I contact her dad? Should I block her number? What do I do??   Thank you for your help.",

It got me thinking what‚Äôs the craziest/most ridiculous thing I‚Äôve ever done for a date.  I remember back in high school, there was this girl that I had been crushing on since freshman year, but she never seemed to notice my existence.   After graduation we were both accepted into different universities and I figured I wouldn‚Äôt see her again. But then came orientation week.   It turns out we were assigned to the same group for campus tours!  I was so excited I almost lost my voice when she said hi to me. I tried to act cool, like I wasn‚Äôt just dying inside from happiness.  She asked if anyone wanted to go grab some ice cream after the tour, and everyone said no, except me and another guy who was desperate to be friends with us both.  We all went to the local ice cream shop. She ordered something simple, vanilla bean, and the other guy ordered chocolate peanut butter cup. I decided to order the biggest sundae they had.  And not just big, like, ‚Äúyou need two people to carry it‚Äù big.  The waitress looked at me like I was insane, but hey, whatever makes her happy, right?  So I spent the next 20 minutes shoveling down that monster while making eye contact with her. At first she was amused, but as I kept going, she started looking concerned.  ‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre okay?‚Äù she asked, ‚ÄúYou look like you‚Äôre gonna explode.‚Äù  ‚ÄúNever better,‚Äù I mumbled through a mouthful of whipped cream.  I ended up finishing the whole thing, but I also ended up spending the rest of the night in the bathroom throwing it all up.  But hey, at least I made an impression. And yes, she did give me her number that day.  It didn‚Äôt lead anywhere, but it still remains one of the dumbest things I‚Äôve ever done for a girl.",

I also recently went to a dermatologist for a skin concern in December and was told that it looked like a wart, but they wanted to test it anyway. I asked if they could do the test immediately since I was already there, but they said no, and made me schedule another appointment for two weeks later just for testing.

I know that \"the office\" has a bunch of episodes, and most people will tell you to just go through them from beginning to end. But I have heard some things about this series that made me think maybe not... So what do you guys recommend?",

    "self_text": "I just finished rewatching it and a thought came to me.  I'm not saying he became a ghost but I think his spirit or energy still lingered at the house after he died, especially because Olivia kept talking about him when she was possessed by the house/evil entity living inside.   It would explain why the children could always feel their father's presence at the house. Also, when Nell finally meets her family in the Red Room, her dad is there with them as well.  Also, they were all standing around the dinner table, which seems like an important symbol for the family, so maybe it's some kind of purgatory where they are stuck until they can be freed from the house?  Anyways, I don't know, just thought I would share!",

    "self_text": "My wife and I have been married for about 6 years.  We are both in our late twenties, we have no kids or pets, and we've lived in the same city all of our lives.   For the past year my wife has been working on herself, going to therapy, doing yoga, meditating, etc. She says that she needs to find herself before we can move forward as a couple.   I am supportive of her journey but I feel like things aren't moving forward at all.   She recently suggested that we live separately for 2-3 months so that she can \"find\" herself. I was shocked because I thought we were doing well, but she said she just wants to be alone right now.   Is it normal for a couple to take some time apart? What is your experience?",
