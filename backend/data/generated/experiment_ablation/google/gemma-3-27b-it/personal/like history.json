I lost my job a month ago, and I’m drowning in applications with no luck. My landlord is threatening eviction because I’m behind on rent. My friends are trying to be supportive, but I can tell they’re starting to get worn down by my negativity. I’m isolating myself more and more, skipping meals, and barely sleeping. I keep having these intrusive thoughts – not necessarily *suicidal*, but just…dark. Like, imagining terrible things happening to me or to the people I love. I’m terrified of spiraling out of control, but I don’t know how to stop it. I’ve scheduled an emergency appointment with my therapist, but it’s not for another week, and I don’t know if I can hold on until then. I just feel so utterly hopeless and lost.",

I confronted him about it yesterday, and he got really defensive, accusing *me* of not trusting him. He said he’s just a private person and doesn’t like being photographed.

Lately though, I’ve been feeling…distant. Like we’re roommates who love each other, rather than partners deeply connected emotionally. We don’t argue, we still have sex, we spend time together – but it feels surface level. He’s been really stressed with work, and I’ve been focusing on my own career, so maybe that’s it? But I feel like we’ve stopped *really* talking, sharing our fears and dreams. It feels like we’re both just existing alongside each other, ticking boxes (dinner, movies, household chores) instead of actively nurturing our bond. I’m scared to bring it up because I don’t want to create conflict, and I don’t want him to feel like I’m blaming him for his stress. Is this a normal ebb and flow in a long term relationship, or is it a sign of something bigger? How do I gently broach this with him without sounding accusatory?",

    "self_text": "So I (22F) have been dating this guy (24M) for about 6 months now. We met online through a gaming community. We’ve video chatted a few times, but always when he says he’s at his parents’ house because his internet is bad at his place. He always angles the camera so I can’t really see much of the background. Lately, I’ve been reverse image searching some of his profile pics and a few have popped up on stock photo sites. I confronted him about it and he got really defensive, saying I’m accusing him of lying and don’t trust him. He then said his friend jokingly used his pictures as a profile pic on a fake account, and that’s why they showed up on those sites. It sounds fishy, and now I'm questioning everything. I asked to video chat again tonight, and he conveniently had a “family emergency” and couldn’t. I’m starting to think he’s not who he says he is. What should I do?",

I'm not sad, I'm not angry, I'm just… hollow. I thought initiating the breakup would spare me heartbreak, but this emptiness is worse. I'm functioning normally – going to work, seeing friends – but inside I feel numb. Is this normal? Did I make a mistake?

He’s constantly texting her, FaceTiming her when he’s “just grabbing coffee,” and talking about her constantly. He says they’re just catching up, but it feels… different. He used to share everything with me, now he clams up whenever I ask about his day. He gets defensive if I even mention her name. Tonight, I accidentally saw a text from her saying “miss our late night talks 🥰” and he immediately minimized the screen. He insists it’s harmless, that she’s just a friend, but I feel like he’s emotionally investing in her instead of me.

They reconnect via social media a few months ago and now they text nearly constantly, and he mentions her in almost every conversation. He says they're just catching up and reminiscing, but it feels…off. He'll laugh at her texts and show them to me, but then get defensive if I ask about them. Yesterday, I accidentally saw a text from her saying “miss our late night talks,” and he IMMEDIATELY snatched his phone away when he saw me looking. He insists it’s harmless, but he’s become increasingly secretive with his phone, and less affectionate with me. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells around him. I don’t know if I’m overreacting, but it feels like he’s developing emotional intimacy with someone else. I've tried talking to him calmly about my concerns, but he dismisses them and accuses me of being insecure. What should I do?",

    "self_text": "My boyfriend (23M) and I (22F) have been together for almost 2 years. Things have been a little rocky lately, he’s been working a lot and we haven’t been spending much quality time together. Lately he’s been very protective of his phone, always locking it and turning the screen away when I’m around. He’s also been receiving a lot of late-night texts and calls that he dismisses as “work.” Tonight I accidentally saw a text pop up on his phone from an unknown number saying “Can’t wait to see you tomorrow 😉”. He immediately snatched the phone away and said it was a wrong number. I don’t know what to do, I feel like my gut is telling me something is wrong but I don’t want to jump to conclusions. Should I confront him? Try to investigate further? Or am I just being paranoid?",

    "title": "I think my boyfriend is emotionally unavailable",
    "self_text": "My boyfriend (26M) and I (24F) have been together for almost a year. Things were great initially, very passionate and exciting. Lately, I’ve noticed a pattern where he shuts down whenever I try to discuss anything remotely deep or vulnerable. Like, if I try to talk about my anxieties or a difficult day at work, he either changes the subject, minimizes my feelings (\"it's not *that* bad\"), or just gives me vague reassurance (“everything will be alright”). He’s fantastic at surface-level affection – cuddles, dates, watching movies – but when I try to connect on an emotional level, it’s like hitting a brick wall. I’ve tried communicating this to him directly, explaining that I need more than just physical intimacy, but he gets defensive and says he’s just “not good at feelings.” I’m starting to feel really lonely and disconnected, like I’m carrying all the emotional labor in the relationship. Is this something that can be fixed, or am I wasting my time trying to get him to open up?",

    "title": "My fiancé is obsessed with his ex",
    "self_text": "My fiancé (29M) and I (27F) have been together for 5 years and engaged for 2. Lately, I’ve noticed he talks about his ex *constantly*. It started subtly – mentioning a shared inside joke, reminiscing about a concert they went to. But it's escalating. He now brings her up several times a week, detailing things they did together, comparing our experiences to theirs, and even showing me pictures of her (claiming he “just found them”). He insists he’s not still in love with her, and says he enjoys our life together, but his obsession is making me feel insecure and unwanted. I’ve brought it up multiple times, explaining how hurtful it is, but he dismisses my concerns, saying I’m overreacting or that I shouldn’t be threatened by someone from his past. Tonight, he spent over an hour talking about a gift he bought her for her birthday years ago. I walked out. I don’t know what to do anymore. Is this a red flag? Am I being unreasonable?",

I’ve gotten notices taped to my door saying they’ll be in to ‘inspect’ with less than 24 hours warning, and yesterday I came home to find they’d been inside *without* any notice at all. Nothing appeared stolen, but it’s a huge violation of my privacy and frankly, scary. I live in California. What are my rights and what should I do?",

    "self_text": "I (24F) live in an apartment in California. My lease states my landlord needs 24 hours notice before entering my unit, except in emergencies. Over the past month, I've come home several times to find my apartment unlocked and seemingly entered while I was out. There are small things moved – a book slightly out of place, a curtain adjusted – nothing stolen, but definitely signs someone was *inside*. Yesterday, I installed a hidden camera facing the entrance door (legal in CA with notification not required for audio recording). Today, I reviewed the footage and confirmed my landlord entered my apartment WHILE I WAS AT WORK, with NO prior notice. He was inside for about 15 minutes. I confronted him via text, politely reminding him of the 24-hour notice requirement and asking why he entered without permission. He vaguely replied that he was “checking on things” and didn’t think I’d mind. I'm freaked out and feel violated. What are my rights here? Should I file a police report? Is this grounds to break my lease? I'm really unsure how to proceed.",

    "self_text": "i absolutely love my boyfriend and he means the world to me, i will love him and his body no matter what. the problem is he’s not happy with his body, he gained a couple pounds since we’ve been together and it’s really started to bother him. i myself am super into working out, i love it. i’ve tried to get him to come with me on multiple occasions but it’s always “i’m too self conscious” “i’m tired from work” “my stomach hurts” “i’ll go tomorrow”. he’ll complain and complain about his body but does absolutely nothing to change it. when he says he’s going to the gym something always comes up, like today it was that he was too tired and he felt sick. again, i feel bad using him like this, but i can’t stand him talking himself down when he is perfectly capable of hitting the gym a couple times a week and he knows this. should i stop trying to push him to workout and just listen to him complain?",
