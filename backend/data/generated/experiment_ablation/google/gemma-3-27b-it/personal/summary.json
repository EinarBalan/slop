Not consistently, anyway. He’ll say he “forgot,” or that money is tight (even though he just bought a new video game). I've brought it up multiple times, trying to be calm and rational (\"Hey, could you send over $40 for groceries?\"), but it always feels like pulling teeth. Last week I covered almost all of our gas for a road trip and still haven’t seen a dime. It’s not huge amounts individually, but it adds up! And honestly, it feels disrespectful, like my time and effort aren't valued. Is it ridiculous to feel this way? Am I supposed to just constantly remind him?

Like, letting him eat cookies before dinner despite knowing I’m trying to establish healthy habits. \n\nMy husband (34M) says I’m being too sensitive and they just want to be involved grandparents. He grew up with very hands-off parents so he doesn’t understand why this bothers me so much. I feel like I’m losing control of my own home and my ability to parent as I see fit. I’ve tried hinting at needing space, but they always brush it off. \n\nI really want a good relationship with them, but I also need to protect my child and my sanity. What’s a script I can use to clearly explain my boundaries *without* starting World War III? Any advice from people who have dealt with similar situations appreciated!

    "self_text": "Okay, so we've been together for 2 years and live together. We *talked* about splitting bills 50/50 when we moved in, but it always ends up falling on me to front everything (groceries, utilities, even things like dog food). He says he's just bad with budgeting and \"forgets\" to Venmo me back. This happens almost every single month! I’ve started keeping a detailed spreadsheet – which feels ridiculous at my age – and politely reminding him, but it’s either met with deflection (\"Oh, I thought I paid you\") or promises to pay later that…don’t happen. It's not huge amounts each time ($50-$100), but it adds up, and honestly, it feels disrespectful. Like my financial contributions aren’t valued. I don’t want to feel like I’m his mom, constantly chasing down money. AITA for getting increasingly annoyed by this and starting to resent him? Has anyone else dealt with something similar, and how did you handle it? I’m considering suggesting we combine finances completely, but I’m worried that will open another can of worms.",

    "self_text": "Okay, so we agreed six months ago to save $500/month towards a downpayment on a house. We both make roughly the same amount of money. I automatically transfer my $500 every month without fail. He…doesn’t. Every single month it’s an excuse – “Oh, I had to pay for car repairs,” or “Unexpected bill at work,” or just flat-out “I forgot.” Last month he said he *thought* he transferred it but hadn’t. I checked our account, obviously. This isn’t small potatoes; it’s adding up! When I bring it up, he gets defensive and says I’m nagging him and doesn't understand the pressures he's under. Honestly, it feels like he thinks I’ll just cover for him indefinitely. I feel incredibly disrespected and like he doesn't take our shared future seriously. Is it crazy to be absolutely livid about this? Like, I want to scream. What can I say to get through to him WITHOUT starting a huge fight where he plays the victim? Any scripts appreciated.",

    "self_text": "Okay, deep breaths. This feels silly even typing it, but I’m really upset. My partner told me they ran an errand yesterday afternoon. I just casually asked my neighbor if they saw them and apparently they were actually at a bar with a coworker during that time. When I confronted them, they downplayed it as \"just grabbing a quick drink\" and acted like it wasn’t a big deal. \n\nIt's not *the* drinking that bothers me (they have a reasonable relationship with alcohol). It's the lying! It was so easy for them to just be honest. Now I'm questioning everything else. Am I being ridiculous? I tend to get anxious and overthink in relationships – past trauma stuff – but this feels different. Like a fundamental breach of trust over something totally avoidable. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this? How did you handle it? Do I need to seriously address this, or am I making a mountain out of a molehill? Any scripts for how to talk about this without sounding completely unhinged would be AMAZING.",

    "self_text": "Okay, deep breaths. My fiancé (30M) and I (28F) are getting married next spring. We’ve been together for two years, engaged for six months. I was looking through his phone – yes, I know, bad habit, but something felt off lately – and saw he texts his ex *every single day*. Not like, quick check-ins. These are full conversations. He said they were just catching up as old friends, but some of them seemed…flirty? He downplayed it when I confronted him, saying she’s going through a hard time and he’s just being supportive. He gets visibly annoyed when I bring it up. I told him it makes me incredibly uncomfortable and feels disrespectful. He says I’m insecure and need to trust him. Honestly, I *want* to trust him, but this feels beyond normal friendship territory. AITA for feeling this way? What should I actually *say* to him? Like, what specific things can I ask him or boundary I can set without sounding crazy? I really don’t want this to blow up into a huge fight before the wedding, but I also don’t want to ignore a red flag.",
