She knows I have a migraine that's been building all day, and I explicitly told her I needed to lie down in a dark room. She insisted it’s “just a headache” and Lily loves spending time with me. I pointed out that migraines are debilitating for me – nausea, sensitivity to light and sound, the whole nine yards – and I wouldn’t be able to provide adequate supervision. She accused me of ruining her night and said I’m always “too sick” to help. She then sent a string of texts listing all the times I’ve declined to babysit in the past, framing it as me not caring about her or Lily.

Before I could formulate a polite response, he added, “You used to be so…robust. It’s quite a change.” I snapped. I told him that was incredibly rude and inappropriate, and that my body is none of his business. I raised my voice a bit, and told him to never comment on my appearance again.

She opted for a cheaper flight with a connection. Yesterday, she calls me freaking out because her connecting flight got canceled due to weather. She asks if we can switch tickets. I politely explained that my flight is significantly more expensive and non-refundable, and frankly, I *need* that direct flight for my mental health. She accused me of being selfish and prioritizing convenience over family. She said I’m ruining Thanksgiving for her and that I should value our family time more than a comfortable flight. Our mom is now chiming in, saying I should “do the right thing” and switch. I offered to help her research alternative routes and even cover some of the cost difference if she rebooked, but she insists I just switch with her.

I gently pushed back on a few things initially, but tried to be polite. \\\n\\\nYesterday, I went to check on the progress and she’d completely rearranged the entire room *without asking*. She’d swapped out the calming mobile I’d selected for a brightly colored carousel, covered the rocker in a frilly afghan, and started hanging portraits of herself as a baby. When I politely pointed out that it wasn’t quite the vibe I was going for, she burst into tears, accusing me of rejecting her efforts and implying I didn’t want her involved. She said she just wanted to create a “warm and loving environment” for her grandchild.

Before we went, we talked about budgeting and splitting costs evenly. Cool. Except…C and D are significantly wealthier than B and me. Throughout the trip, C and D insisted on ordering the most expensive drinks, appetizers, dinners, etc. Like, lobster tower expensive. They booked a suite at the hotel and then expected us to split that cost too, despite B and I explicitly stating we were sticking to a budget. They kept saying things like “it’s a celebration!” and “you deserve to splurge!” but *we* didn’t initiate the splurging. When the bill came, it was astronomical. They wanted to split it four ways, which meant B and I would owe hundreds more than we anticipated. I politely pushed back, explaining that we had agreed to a budget and that it wasn’t fair for us to subsidize their lavish spending. C accused me of ruining the vibe and being cheap. D said I was embarrassing B on her birthday. B was stuck in the middle, trying to smooth things over, but ultimately sided with me. We ended up calculating individual expenses and only paying for what we personally consumed. C and D were furious and spent the rest of the trip giving us the silent treatment. Now they’re mad at me for “making a scene” and “being unreasonable.” Am I the asshole for refusing to split the bill evenly when they kept upgrading everything without consulting us?",

Every year she offers to decorate my house (I’m 32F) and every year I politely decline.

Last year she showed up WITH decorations while I was at work and started rearranging things. I came home to a house that looked like Santa exploded. I nicely but firmly asked her to undo it, and she sulked for a week. This year she’s been hinting again, sending me links to gaudy ornaments and suggesting color schemes I actively dislike. I told her, gently but directly, that I appreciate the offer, but I enjoy decorating with my husband and creating a space that reflects *our* tastes. She launched into a lecture about “tradition” and how “Christmas isn’t Christmas without proper decorations.” She accused me of disrespecting her and ruining the holiday for her grandchildren. My husband (33M) thinks I was too blunt and should have just let her decorate to avoid conflict. He says it’s “not worth upsetting her.” I disagree – it’s *my* house, and I want it to reflect *my* style. AITA for setting a boundary with my MIL?",
