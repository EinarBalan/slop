Like, we already had a problem with leveling after hitting max level, now they’re just doubling down on it? \n\nI get wanting to address power creep, but slowing everything down doesn't solve anything - it just makes it exhausting. And don’t even get me STARTED on the changes to Unique drops. Feels like they’re making targeted farming almost pointless. \n\nAnyone else feeling similarly frustrated, or am I missing something? What are your biggest concerns about the patch? Maybe someone can explain the reasoning behind some of these choices because right now it seems counterintuitive to retaining players. Also, any thoughts on how this impacts different builds specifically? I main Sorc, and I'm worried about crackling energy being completely gutted.",
