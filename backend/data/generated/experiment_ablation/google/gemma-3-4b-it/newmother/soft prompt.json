Crack your eggs into small ramekins or cups (this makes them easier to lower into the water).\n3.  Gently lower each egg into the simmering water, one at a time.\n4.  Cook for 3-4 minutes for a runny yolk. Adjust cooking time based on preference.\n5.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Season with salt and pepper.

    "self_text": "So, my Liam loves learning about plants, particularly how they grow. He also loves reading books on genetics and plant breeding.   Recently, we have been talking about the concept of \"polyploidy\", or multiple sets of chromosomes, as it relates to certain plants like wheat.  He asked me if a plant could just grow another set of chromosomes randomly, and I explained that it doesn‚Äôt happen like that. It requires some specific environmental triggers to cause the cells to divide into multiple sets, such as exposure to chemicals.  But then he asked if any of those chemical exposures would allow him to be able to grow an extra chromosome!  I said no, but he did ask if I knew of any scientific experiments that had ever involved that sort of thing.  Then he came back with something that really shocked me: ‚ÄúDad, I read about scientists creating a new species of plant called ‚Äúwheat‚Äù by exposing normal wheat seeds to chemicals, and turning them into polyploid wheat.‚Äù  I looked up the research on that wheat type and discovered that it was actually created by researchers at Oregon State University in 2017!  The new wheat is called ‚ÄúWheatPlus‚Äù.   When I told him that, he got so excited.  ‚ÄúWow, Dad, you can make more wheat with chemicals!‚Äù   Now he wants to become a scientist and study what causes plants to become polyploid.  It is amazing to watch him learn, and even more amazing that he knows about his interest in science.   I am grateful for all the knowledge he brings to our family.  His favorite part is watching videos on YouTube about wheat genetics and plant breeding.  It‚Äôs incredible.",

Then he took my hand and said, ‚ÄúDad, I love you very much.‚Äù   I wept uncontrollably.   ‚ÄúI love you too, son,‚Äù I choked out.   As I held his hand, a nurse came in and said, ‚ÄúMr. Miller, we have good news. The doctors found some antibodies in your son‚Äôs blood that are attacking the cancer cells.‚Äù   I looked at my son, then at the nurse, then back at my son.   ‚ÄúWhat do they want to do?‚Äù I asked.   The nurse replied, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to give him a high dose of chemotherapy. It‚Äôll kill the cancer cells, but it will also cause severe side effects. But we believe it is our best chance to save his life.‚Äù   I looked at my son, who squeezed my hand.  ‚ÄúDo it!‚Äù I shouted.   ‚ÄúDo it!‚Äù I repeated.   ‚ÄúYes, Dad,‚Äù my son whispered.   I held his hand tightly as the nurse administered the drug.   After the injection, my son started convulsing. His face turned purple. He gasped for air.   I screamed, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening?‚Äù   The nurse replied, ‚ÄúHis body is rejecting the medication. We are giving him medicine to stop the convulsions and stabilize him.‚Äù   After a few minutes, my son calmed down.  ‚ÄúDad,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI feel really bad.‚Äù   ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, son,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be okay.‚Äù   ‚ÄúDad,‚Äù he said again, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got something to tell you.‚Äù   ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù I asked.   ‚ÄúI just realized‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to be a lawyer anymore.‚Äù   I stared at my son in disbelief.   ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôve decided I want to be a firefighter,‚Äù he said.   I grabbed my son and hugged him tight.   ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs wonderful, son!‚Äù I exclaimed.   ‚ÄúHow could you not know?‚Äù he asked.   ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt realize,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúWell, now you do,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúNow, let's go get some ice cream.‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúLet's go!‚Äù he said.  We went outside and into the yard. A woman ran up to us and screamed, ‚ÄúMr. Miller! My husband is choking!‚Äù   I grabbed my son, pointed to her and said, ‚ÄúGo! Go! Be a firefighter!‚Äù   My son ran toward the fire station.   I followed him and began to perform CPR on the man.   The paramedics arrived and took over.   They brought the man back to life.   After the ambulance left, I sat down and cried.   My son came running back to me.   ‚ÄúDad,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre asking for me.‚Äù   ‚ÄúGet in there!‚Äù I yelled.   ‚ÄúOkay, Dad,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúCome here,‚Äù I said.   I pulled my son into a hug and said, ‚ÄúYou did a great job today.‚Äù   ‚ÄúThanks, Dad,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with you? You‚Äôre crying,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud of myself,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúI am too,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre a firefighter,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúMe too,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI love you too,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúYou made me so proud,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúThank you, Dad,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúYou were amazing,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúYou saved his life,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI just wanted to help,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúYou did more than help,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúYou were a hero,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI just wanted to be a hero,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúYou were a hero,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud of you,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúI love you too,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúThank you, Dad,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome, son,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad I could help,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúYou were great,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre a firefighter,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI just wanted to be a firefighter,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre perfect for it,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud of you,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúI love you too,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my hero,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your hero,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre both heroes,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúSo am I,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy too,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI love you too,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my hero,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your hero,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúSo am I,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy too,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI love you too,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my hero,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your hero,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúSo am I,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy too,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI love you too,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my hero,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your hero,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúSo am I,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy too,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI love you too,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my hero,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your hero,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúSo am I,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy too,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI love you too,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my hero,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your hero,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúSo am I,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy too,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI love you too,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my hero,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your hero,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúSo am I,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy too,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI love you too,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my hero,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your hero,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúSo am I,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy too,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI love you too,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my hero,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your hero,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúSo am I,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy too,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI love you too,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my hero,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your hero,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúSo am I,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy too,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI love you too,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my hero,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your hero,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúSo am I,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy too,‚Äù he said.   ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù I said.   ‚ÄúI love you too,‚Äù he said.",

    "self_text": "Here are some suggestions:\n\n*   Ask if she has any specific things she wants or needs. This takes the pressure off of you and gives her agency over what she gets. It also helps you avoid buying something she won‚Äôt actually wear.\n*   If she doesn‚Äôt know exactly what she wants, suggest some items that fit into a certain category (e.g., ‚ÄúWould you like a new sweater?‚Äù). Then let her choose from a selection.\n*   Buy her clothes on sale or at thrift stores. You can find great deals without breaking the bank.\n*   Start a clothing swap with other parents. Everyone brings their outgrown clothes, and then you all trade them.\n*   Give her an allowance and let her use it to buy herself clothes.  This teaches financial responsibility.\n*   Tell her that you love her very much and that your love for her doesn‚Äôt depend on how much money you spend on her.  That‚Äôs probably the most important thing!\n*   If you are having trouble affording something, talk to her about it honestly and simply. Explain that you are doing your best and appreciate what she already has.\n\nEdit: Also, consider asking if she would be okay with wearing hand-me-downs from older siblings or cousins.",
