    "title": "New PC Build Budget Concerns",
    "self_text": "Hi guys, not sure if this is the right sub but it is one of the largest. I’m considering buying a PC this Black Friday but am kind of conflicted about what to get. Just to give some context, I used to game on a laptop but I then bought a PS5 and play exclusives and the AAA games on it exclusively. I traded in my laptop for a Macbook for work and such but I still use my Mac for multiplayer games like WoW. I am considering getting a PC because of new exclusives like Starfield and Game Pass. Plush, the mac heats up too quickly. I have a couple of Nest Mini and Nest Hub devices that shall be used for voice control. I also have a Xiaomi desk lamp and a Roborock cleaning robot. I plan to display the Home Assistant dashboard on the Nest Hubs, but I am not sure how that actually works. I have seen the cast option, but still have 2 questions: Is casting a 2 way control, or is it just for showing the dashboard? Can I make the cast always available on the Hub, so that the user can switch between different things on the Hub? Now I need a solution for my radiators. I have seen that the Bosch has released a new version of their Zigbee thermostats. I have shortly used them and they had a problem with overshooting the temperature a lot. I quess that they have fixed that by now with an update, but if I connect HA directly to thermostats without a bridge, I wouldn't get the updates. The other option would be to get Tado devices, which are not Zigbee, but I have seen that they should work with HomeKit in Home Assistant. I guess that Tado software is more mature than Bosch and has more functionality overall. Finally, I could get Aqara thermostats for almost the same money as Tado, but I was not really impressed with the build quality... Is there any way to update the devices without a bridge and cloud, but directly via Zigbee for example? Do Tado work locally with HA and HomeKit? How does Tado integrate into HA? I plan to automate lighting again, but this time probably with Shelly devices instead of Sonoff. I guess they are a fair bit better too... Which Zigbee stick would you choose? ConBee II or Sonoff Plus? Do you maybe have some other advice for me? What should I consider or take care about? Thanks a lot!!! :)",
