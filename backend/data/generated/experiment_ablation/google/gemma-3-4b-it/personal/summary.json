Like every single text, call, or visit she asks me if he’s good for me, if I’m happy, if we’re serious, etc. She’ll also offer unsolicited advice on what I should do or say. I've politely told her that I appreciate her concern but that it makes me uncomfortable when she constantly brings up my relationship. She just brushes it off saying “I’m just looking out for you” or “You don’t understand.” I’ve asked her to respect my privacy and let me share the details of my relationship when I want to. Yesterday, she told me I was being dramatic and that all her comments were coming from a place of love. AITA?",

We’re not even seriously committed yet, so she has no right to be this involved. When I tell her I don’t want to talk about him, she gets offended and says I don’t trust him.

When he started dating my sister, I told her I wouldn't be happy if he was there. She said it was rude and uninvited. I'm feeling guilty but also standing my ground. Am I being unreasonable?",

    "self_text": "We both have full time jobs and live together. My partner works from home so he has more flexibility than me but when I come home he always takes a nap, watches tv, plays video games etc. He does some cleaning but it's usually just like, a quick wipe down of the counter before dinner and I end up doing most of the housework. I feel like I'm stuck in a cycle of complaining and him saying he'll do better next week which never happens. Do I need to be more specific about what I expect or am I being unreasonable?",

    "self_text": "My mom has always been extremely overbearing. She constantly tries to tell me what to do, she doesn’t respect my decisions, and she makes rude comments about my partner. She's also incredibly difficult to be around - always complaining, talking about herself, and generally making everything about her. I tried setting boundaries with her, but she ignores them and keeps pushing. As I get closer to getting married, I realize I need to protect myself and my relationship. I told my mom that I won’t be able to have her at my wedding because I don’t think it would be enjoyable for either of us. She got upset and said I was being cruel and ungrateful. Now she's trying to guilt trip me into changing my mind. Am I the AH for prioritizing my own happiness and protecting my marriage?",
