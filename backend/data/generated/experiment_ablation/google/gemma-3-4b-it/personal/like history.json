I’ve been seeing a therapist and taking medication, but I still have really bad panic attacks and generalized anxiety. I’ve been dating my boyfriend, Mark, for about 6 months, and he’s incredibly supportive and understanding. However, I’m hesitant to tell him because I’m afraid he’ll think I’m unstable or that he won’t be able to cope with it. I want to be open with him, but I also don’t want to burden him with my struggles. What are your thoughts? Should I tell him, and if so, how should I approach the conversation?",

    "self_text": "I'm a single parent of a 6 year old child. I separated with my ex about 3 years ago. We have joint custody and visitation. Until recently, everything has been pretty smooth sailing. My ex has always been a responsible parent, and I've never had any concerns about his ability to care for our child. However, he's recently been exhibiting some concerning behaviors. He's been excessively permissive with our child, allowing him to stay up late, eat junk food, and skip chores. He also seems to be isolating our child from his friends and family. I've expressed my concerns to him multiple times, but he dismisses them as me being overly controlling and trying to undermine his authority. Despite my repeated attempts to communicate constructively, he continues to disregard my feedback and maintain his current parenting style. Recently, I filed a motion with the court requesting modifications to the custody agreement to address these concerns, outlining specific examples of his problematic behavior. My ex vehemently opposes the motion and claims that I'm attempting to sabotage his role as a father. The judge has scheduled a hearing next month to discuss the matter. I believe it's crucial to protect my child's well-being, but I'm worried that my ex's resistance will make it difficult to achieve a favorable outcome. Given the situation, AITA for seeking modifications to the custody agreement?",

For context, the house was bought by my parents when we moved states over 20 years ago, but after a nasty fight, my grandma refused to move out so my parents, sister and I moved instead, and she kept living there. Recently my grandma (88F) could no longer live on her own, so my mother took her in and I moved here.   My grandma is a bit of a hoarder. She had boxes full of decades old stuff that had not seen the light of day in years. When she moved to my mom's, I was left to sort the bulk of it out. However, I would defer to her before throwing or giving away anything. She has very bad memory and sometimes denied I ever asked her, so I kept some items in case she changed her mind.   She also had a car that she barely used and I kept it after she could no longer drive. I spent a lot of money trying to get it back in shape, but it bled me out if my savings with constant new repairs, so it was sold with her blessing, and she told me to keep the money.   All of this happened a year ago. Yesterday I brought her the last of her stuff, and today she called me to ask about some missing books, and when I told her that I did give them away, she started crying, accusing me of not appreciating any of that stuff, and bringing up how I should have insisted more on her keeping some of the money.   I feel guilty. My mother said I shouldn't worry because I did nothing wrong, and my grandma has to learn to let go of things she no longer uses.

However, lately I’ve been feeling increasingly suffocated by him. He tends to be overly possessive and controlling, constantly checking up on me, questioning my whereabouts, and getting upset when I spend time with my friends. It started subtly, but it's escalating. Lately, he's been monitoring my social media, demanding to see my messages, and accusing me of flirting with other guys. It’s making me feel trapped and like I’m losing my independence. I've tried talking to him about it, explaining how his behavior makes me uncomfortable and anxious, but he dismisses my concerns, saying I'm being paranoid and insecure, and that he’s just caring about me. He says he loves me and wants to protect me, but his actions are actually isolating me from my support system and eroding my self-esteem. I’m starting to wonder if this is a sign of a deeper issue, possibly even some underlying jealousy or insecurity on his part. I'm torn – I still care about him and cherish our shared history, but I can't continue to live in a relationship where I feel controlled and stifled. I don’t want to ruin things unnecessarily, but I also don’t want to sacrifice my happiness and wellbeing. Has anyone experienced something similar? What advice would you give me?",

Recently my grandma (88F) could no longer live on her own, so my mother took her in and I moved here.   My grandma is a bit of a hoarder. She had boxes full of decades old stuff that had not seen the light of day in years. When she moved to my mom’s, I was left to sort the bulk of it out. However, I would defer to her before throwing or giving away anything. She has very bad memory and sometimes denied I ever asked her, so I kept some items in case she changed her mind.  She also had a car that she barely used and I kept it after she could no longer drive. I spent a lot of money trying to get it back in shape, but it bled me out if my savings with constant new repairs, so it was sold with her blessing, and she told me to keep the money.   All of this happened a year ago. Yesterday I brought her the last of her stuff, and today she called me to ask about some missing books, and when I told her that I did give them away, she started crying, accusing me of not appreciating any of that stuff, and bringing up how I should have “insisted” more on keeping some of the money.
