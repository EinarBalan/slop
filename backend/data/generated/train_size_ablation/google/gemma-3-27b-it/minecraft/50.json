It seems that when i try to start up the server with the new modpack, the server does not run properly, or even runs at all. The error message that shows up in the server console reads \"The registry contains invalid data\" (i will provide a full copy of the logs if needed). Does anyone know what may be causing this issue? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!  (P.S. Sorry for any bad formatting, as this is my first time posting on Reddit.)",
