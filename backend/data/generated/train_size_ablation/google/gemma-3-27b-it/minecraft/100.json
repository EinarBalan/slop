I missed out on the glow squid vs iceaxolotl/frog vote last year because I didn't know about it until after the winner was decided, but that wasn't really a big deal since I don't have any preference either way. However, I think I might miss out on the current mob vote again if there is no notification of it on launch. Are these votes important? Is there something major I am missing out on by not participating? Should I make sure to follow all the social media accounts now to stay up-to-date?",
