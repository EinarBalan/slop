The acceleration is great, and the steering feels very responsive.  I am also impressed with the fuel economy.  I got about 30 miles per gallon on the highway, which is pretty good for a sports car.

If our consciousness is just the result of neural activity in the brain, then what happens to our dreams when we die? Will they simply cease to exist along with our brains, or do they somehow persist in another form? Does anyone have any thoughts on this topic?  I know that this is a very speculative question, but I'm genuinely curious to hear people's perspectives on it.   I’m an atheist and don’t believe in God or life after death.  What makes me wonder is why we dream at all. If it’s just random firing of neurons as some scientists say, then why do we experience them so vividly? And why are they often so bizarre and emotionally charged? It seems like there must be something more going on than just random chance.  Maybe our dreams are a way for our brains to process emotions and memories, or maybe they’re a glimpse into another dimension. Or perhaps they’re just a byproduct of our evolutionary history, serving no real purpose. I really don’t know.   But if dreams are indeed a byproduct of our evolutionary history, then what does that mean for our sense of self? Are we nothing more than the sum of our experiences and memories? Is there anything else to us beyond our physical bodies?  And if there isn’t, then what’s the point of it all?",

I've been with my current company for about 10 years (I know, that’s long time) and started as an engineer and moved into product management after about 5 years.  For the last five years I've been managing products focused on our core infrastructure platform. It’s a high-visibility role with lots of cross functional collaboration. We built out a whole new system from scratch over the past three years which has had a big impact on the business.   I have a few offers coming up. A couple are senior PM roles at slightly larger companies in similar areas. There is also a VP of Product opportunity at a smaller startup.    Here’s where it gets tricky -  My current manager/VP is leaving soon so there will be a leadership transition. This will require me to start taking on some of his responsibilities like running large executive meetings, interfacing directly with engineering leaders etc. In short, my job description will become more senior without any increase in compensation.  On top of that, I’m starting to get bored of our current product line. I love building things but I don’t feel passionate about what we’re building anymore.   I really enjoy my current team, and I think we work well together. But I’m concerned that staying would mean getting stuck doing the same thing day after day. On the other hand, I’m nervous about giving up the stability and comfort of my current role.  What should I do? Should I stay and take on more responsibility? Or should I move on to something new?",

They can even hold conversations and answer questions in a way that feels natural. But they still lack something essential: a sense of empathy or understanding.  If we want to create truly intelligent AI, we need to find a way to give it these qualities. This will be a huge challenge, but it’s one that I think is worth pursuing.",
