We’ve been living together for about six months and we are both in college but it feels like we aren’t on the same page when it comes to money. She likes to spend her money on clothes/makeup/going out with friends etc, while I save almost all of mine. I don’t mind if she spends some of her money on fun things, but she gets mad at me when I suggest that maybe we should start thinking about saving more. It's not even about “her” spending habits as much as it is us having common goals. Like, she wants to move into a better place next year, but isn’t willing to put any money away towards it. I’m worried that we will never be able to achieve anything big because she doesn’t see the value in saving. Any advice on how to get us on the same page?",
