He doesn't do anything around the house, never cooks or cleans up, and barely talks to me unless it’s to yell at me. I’m pretty sure he hates me because he always says that if I wasn’t born, he could have married his high school sweetheart. It sucks being an only child with no mother and a dad who clearly wishes you weren’t alive.  He also goes out every night and comes home drunk and yelling. He once told me he wished I would die in my sleep and I’ve been having nightmares ever since. I hate him and wish he would just disappear.  I know it’s not right to say such things, but sometimes I can’t help myself.  AITA for saying my dad is a loser?",

    "title": "1967 - 1972 Chevelle, Malibu and Monte Carlo Engine Identification",
    "self_text": "I've got a bunch of numbers from my engine (cast number, date code, VIN derivative) but I can't seem to figure out what it is. I'm looking for an early to mid-size V8. The cast number is 3955557, the date code is A2072, and the VIN derivative is B247.   I have been doing some research on these numbers and have found that they are all related to Chevrolet engines made in Tonawanda, New York between 1967 and 1972.  However, the exact details of these codes are difficult to find.   Here is what I've learned so far:   Cast Number: This number identifies the core design of the engine block. It doesn't tell you much about the specific year or model. Date Code: This code tells you when the engine block was cast. In this case, \"A\" means January and \"20\" means the 20th day of the month. So the block was cast on January 20th, 1972.  VIN Derivative: This is where things get tricky. The VIN derivative is supposed to identify the original vehicle the engine came from. However, there are several different interpretations of what each digit means.  The most common interpretation is as follows:   B = 1967   2 = Mid-Size Car   4 = V8 Engine   7 = Power Steering   So based on this interpretation, your engine is from a 1967 mid-size car with a V8 engine and power steering.  However, other sources say that the VIN derivative also includes information about the transmission type and rear axle ratio.  If we take those into account, then your engine could be from a 1967 mid-size car with a V8 engine, automatic transmission and 3.08 rear axle ratio.   To help me narrow down the possibilities, please provide any additional information you may have about your engine. For example:   * What kind of intake manifold does it have?   * What kind of carburetor does it have?   * What kind of exhaust manifolds does it have?   * Does it have air conditioning?   * Is it a two-barrel or four-barrel carb?   * Does it have a factory distributor or aftermarket?   * What kind of oil pan does it have?   * Any markings or stickers on the engine?   * Is it a small-block or big-block?   * What size head bolts do you see?   * Is the valve cover flat or raised?   * Does the water pump have a high volume or low volume impeller?   * Are the pistons forged or cast iron?   * Do the heads have screw-in or pressed-in studs?   * What color is the engine block?   * How many bolt holes does the bellhousing have?   * What is the cylinder bore and stroke?   * How many horsepower does it make?   * Does it have a smog pump?   * Does it have a thermostat housing on the side or top?   * Is the intake manifold aluminum or cast iron?   * What is the compression ratio?   * What kind of spark plugs does it use?   * Does it have a vacuum advance distributor?   * Is the alternator internally regulated or externally regulated?   * Does it have a mechanical fuel pump or electric fuel pump?   * Is the radiator aluminum or copper/brass?   * What is the diameter of the throttle body?   * What is the length of the exhaust pipes?   * What is the width of the tires?   * What is the height of the suspension?   * What is the weight of the car?   * What is the fuel economy?   * What is the mileage?   * What is the condition of the paint?   * What is the interior like?   * Has the engine ever been rebuilt?   * If so, what parts were replaced?   * Is there any paperwork available?   * What is the asking price?   * Why are you selling it?   * Where are you located?   * Will you ship it?   * Are there any warranties?   * Do you accept returns?   * Can I inspect it in person?   * Are there any pictures available?   * What are the dimensions of the engine?   * What is the firing order?   * What is the camshaft profile?   * What is the timing curve?   * What is the idle speed?   * What is the maximum rpm?   * What is the cooling system capacity?   * What is the electrical system voltage?   * What is the oil pressure?   * What is the coolant temperature?   * What is the air filter size?   * What is the fuel filter size?   * What is the brake line size?   * What is the steering wheel diameter?
