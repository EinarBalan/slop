He always asks her who the person is and what they were talking about. Today, I was on FaceTime with my sister while she went out to lunch with her friend Sarah. Her boyfriend texted her asking where she was and what she was doing. She told him she was having lunch with Sarah, but he still got mad at her. It felt weird how he reacted like that, as if it was wrong for her to hang out with her friend. Is this normal? Does this seem like a red flag?",

At first, I thought it was just a joke because his brother always pranked us, but when he handed us two small pieces of blotter paper, I knew something was up. It turned out they were LSD, which we had never tried before. We both ate them at the same time, and after about half an hour we started feeling weird. Everything was getting really colorful and moving around, and we were laughing hysterically at nothing. We ended up going outside and running around in circles, staring at the stars and trees, and generally having a good time. But then things started to get intense. The colors got even brighter, and everything started warping and changing shape. I felt like I was floating above my body, and I could see myself from a third-person perspective. It was terrifying, but also incredibly fascinating. I spent the next few hours trying to make sense of what was happening, but it was impossible. Everything was too overwhelming and chaotic. Eventually, I managed to calm down and focus on my breathing, and slowly the effects began to wear off. By the end of the night, I was exhausted and emotionally drained, but also strangely grateful for the experience. It taught me a lot about myself and the world around me, and it made me appreciate the beauty and wonder of life. Now, I still occasionally take psychedelics, but I always do so responsibly and with respect for their power.",

They try to take advantage of Spidey‚Äôs emotional state after MJ breaks up with him, as they are aware that she holds great importance in his life. Then, Doctor Strange comes along to help Peter get back on track, but his own past mistakes come back to haunt him as he must also deal with the consequences of using dark magic.  I think it would be really awesome if they could bring back Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield to team up with Tom Holland, making it a multiverse Spider-Man event. It would show how far Spidey has come since being a high school student, while still holding onto his sense of humor and compassion.

I mean, you can go back to the series against the Warriors in 2016, when Draymond Green was suspended for Game 5 due to flagrant foul points and he could've played in Games 7 if they had won Game 5. That's like if LeBron James gets ejected from Game 4 of the 2013 Finals, but he can still play in Game 7 if they win.  I'm not saying that would have guaranteed the Thunder winning the series, but I think it is fair to say that they were robbed of a chance to win a championship because of the referees. Then you look at the injury to Kevin Durant, which basically ended their chances of making another run at a title. It's just so frustrating to see such a talented team get thwarted by circumstances beyond their control. I mean, what could they do? They couldn't control the refs or prevent Kevin Durant from getting injured. All they could do was keep playing hard and try to make the most of their situation. And they did. They made it to the Western Conference Finals in 2016 without KD, and then they lost to the Warriors in seven games. I know some people might say that the Warriors were simply better, but I disagree. I think the Thunder were a legitimate contender, and they deserved a better fate. It's just sad to see how things turned out for them. I really wanted to see them win a championship.  It's especially sad because they had such a bright future. With Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, and Serge Ibaka all in their prime, they were poised to dominate the league for years to come. But now, with Durant gone and Westbrook traded away, they're no longer the same team. They're still good, but they're not great anymore.  I guess that's just the way things go sometimes. Sometimes, even the best teams get unlucky. But it doesn't make it any easier to watch.  I think the Thunder are cursed. And I don't think they'll ever break the curse.",

I'm starting to lose hope and wonder if I'll ever find someone who works well with me. Did anyone else experience something similar? And how long did it end up taking you to find a good therapist? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

    "self_text": "So, i've been trying to find a job in the software engineering field since January and it was getting me down. But then i applied for an internship at my university and i had an interview today and they said i could have the job! Now i just need to wait until HR gets back to me with some details about salary and work schedule but i am so happy right now that something is finally going my way.  I know its not a full time job or anything super exciting but i think this will be great experience to help me build my resume and hopefully get a better job after college. I just wanted to share this little win with you guys. Thanks for all of the support during these stressful few months, you guys are awesome!",

    "self_text": "I'm an incoming senior at university, and am starting to think about my future. I have a CS degree with GPA of 3.84/4.0 (so far), but I don't really have any internship experience. So how do I land a good software engineering job after graduation? I'm currently thinking about applying for jobs in summer or winter internships, but I don't know if it's too late.  I also read some advice online saying that the best way to find a job is through referrals from employees working at tech companies. But how do you go about getting these referrals? Do you just reach out to people on LinkedIn and ask them for help? Or are there other ways? Any advice would be appreciated!",

I asked them all politely to let me through so I could use the restroom, and they just kept telling me \"you should have gone before\".  I then walked over everyone to get to the restroom. It's not fun being stuck between 10 people who can't do basic human decency.  If you need to pee, please move over. I had to miss half a song but it was better than peeing my pants on the floor.",

I feel like my wife is going through all of this alone while I'm just standing around watching.  She seems so angry all the time and that scares me.   We're doing marriage counseling but it hasn't seemed to help much yet.   I'm not sure how to talk to her anymore without setting off an explosion.  It's been hard to find time for ourselves too and I miss our intimacy.   But she doesn't seem interested at all.   What am I missing? How can I help? What should I expect?",
