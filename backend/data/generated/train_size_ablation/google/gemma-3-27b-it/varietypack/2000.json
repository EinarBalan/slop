A look at the film that made David Bowie a star.  But is it any good?  In my opinion, yes, but I have to admit, there are some things about it that don't quite work.  For instance, why does Newton make such a big deal out of not eating meat when he eats fish? And what's with all the nudity?  It seems like Roeg was trying too hard to be provocative.  However, the film is visually stunning, and the acting is excellent.  David Bowie gives a brilliant performance as Newton, and Rip Torn is great as Nathan Bryce.  I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys science fiction or art house cinema.",

For context, I grew up in an abusive household where my mom was constantly screaming at me and telling me how worthless I am. She was emotionally manipulative and I never felt like I could ever be good enough for her. When I met my wife, she was so loving and supportive, and she made me feel safe and valued for the first time in my life.  I started opening up to her about my childhood and she listened without judgment. She helped me process my feelings and validated my experiences. However, recently, I've noticed that talking to her about my trauma has actually been making me feel worse instead of better.  Whenever I start talking about my past, she gets really upset and starts trying to fix things or offer solutions. She doesn't seem to understand that sometimes I just need someone to listen and acknowledge my pain.  She also tends to compare my experiences to hers, which makes me feel like my struggles aren't being taken seriously. I know she means well, but her reactions are invalidating and make me feel even more alone.   I'm starting to dread sharing my thoughts and feelings with her because I know it will only lead to disappointment and frustration. I want to continue being vulnerable with her, but I don't know how to communicate my needs effectively without hurting her feelings.   Any advice on how to navigate this situation?  Should I try to find another outlet for processing my trauma, like therapy? Or should I focus on setting boundaries with my wife and teaching her how to provide the support I need?",

I was going to ask her out for coffee but then I saw that she had a boyfriend...  What should I do??  I don't want to ruin their relationship or anything like that. But maybe I could still get to know her as a friend or something? I have no idea what to do.  Any advice would be appreciated!",
