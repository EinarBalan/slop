In the event that you have a player who is transferring to your school and they are coming from an FCS school or Division II/III school, their scholarship money will be counted against your total amount of scholarships allowed.   If you are recruiting a player with 3 years left in their eligibility, but he played only 1 year at the DII/FCS level, then they are still counting as a full-year scholarship for all three years.  On top of that, there is also a stipulation where your coaching staff has to wait until the end of the season before being able to contact the player.  The reason why it’s such a big deal is because some coaches do not want to take the chance of waiting to see how a guy develops.

I was hoping to get into music as a child and took piano lessons for many years. I wasn’t particularly talented or gifted, just passionate about it and enjoyed it greatly. My family didn’t have much money, so when I reached high school age they said I could no longer continue lessons because we had more pressing financial needs (which I understood) and it was only then that I realized how important it was to me and how deeply saddened I would be to let it go. Fast forward 15 years and I still occasionally play on an electric keyboard when I can afford to rent one, but I’ve never gotten back into it. As I get older, I realize that my brain has lost its ability to learn new things quickly and efficiently, and that even if I were able to dedicate myself to practicing every day, I don’t think I’d ever be good enough to play professionally.

But after watching a few videos on it, reading through the core rulebook, and even looking at some of the character build guides, I am honestly pretty confused about how much better this is than 5e.  I love that there isn't advantage or disadvantage, and instead they have the three levels of success/failure with the use of different dice. It seems neat but hard to wrap my head around in practice without a lot of reference sheets.  I also really like the idea of having only 6 stats, each with a unique role, rather than the classic six stats of STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA. That being said, I feel like some of the roles are redundant and could easily be folded into existing ones. Also, when building a character, does anyone else find themselves constantly flipping between pages just to figure out what stat goes where?  Does anyone else get the impression that this game is going to require an absurd amount of notes and tracking compared to other systems?  Also, it seems very limited in terms of class choices... Is this something that will be expanded upon later?  What are your thoughts on the new system?
