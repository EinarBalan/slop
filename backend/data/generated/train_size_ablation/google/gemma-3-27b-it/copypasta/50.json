I could tell from their first interaction in episode 1! He was instantly interested in her!! I really hope they don't ruin it with something stupid like him getting rejected by Haru or something! That would be lame af!!! She has always been there for him through everything. Like when she had to go into hiding after being caught doing stuff around school. It took her a week before she even replied to him, but it's okay because she said that she didn't want to bother him while he was working on his job. I wonder if she still works there though. But honestly speaking, I wouldn't care if she worked as an employee at my company. She would definitely be someone worth having in my life!!! I just feel bad for everyone who hates Legosi because they think he is weird. He is actually pretty cute. If only he didn't smell like deer.",

    "self_text": "I was in the army, stationed at a base near where my dad worked as an electrician. He got called out to fix something at the barracks, and that’s where he first saw my mom. She was working as a nurse at the clinic on base. My dad said it was love at first sight. They started dating shortly after that, and they were married within a year. They’ve been together ever since, and they still tell everyone about how they met. It’s a pretty romantic story, honestly.  I think it's really cool that my parents met because of their jobs. It just goes to show you that you never know where you’re going to meet the person you’re supposed to be with. My dad always jokes around saying that if he hadn’t gotten that call to fix the electrical problem at the barracks, he would have never met my mom. And my mom says that if she hadn’t decided to work at the clinic on base, they wouldn’t have met either. It's funny to think about all the little things that had to happen for them to end up together.  They are both so happy and grateful for each other.  They truly are soulmates, and I am so lucky to have them as my parents.  It makes me believe in fate and destiny.  I hope to find someone who looks at me the way my parents look at each other.  I want to experience that kind of love someday.  It seems like such a beautiful thing.  I'm not sure if I will ever find someone who loves me as much as my parents love each other, but I can dream about it.  I'm glad that my parents found each other.  They are perfect for each other.",

    "self_text": "Okay, so you are all familiar with the War on Terror, I am going to give a little rundown of what exactly happened during the war on terror in its early stages and then explain some changes that have occurred throughout the years, from the very beginning when the terrorist organization known as Al-Qaeda was formed by Osama Bin Laden and his band of foreign fighters who fought against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, up until today where the United States military is still stationed in several countries around the world fighting against ISIS and other Islamic extremist organizations. The war began after the attacks of September 11th 2001, when the United States and the rest of the western world were thrown into a state of shock and panic after seeing footage of planes flying into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. The first major operation done by the United States government under President George W Bush was Operation Enduring Freedom, which involved invading Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban regime and dismantle Al-Qaeda's base of operations there. This went well for a while, but eventually led to the US becoming bogged down in a long and costly conflict, like the Soviets had before them. It wasn’t long until another country became the next target of the War on Terror, Iraq. In March of 2003, the United States invaded Iraq under claims that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction and had ties to Al-Qaeda. These claims turned out to be false, and the invasion quickly devolved into an insurgency that lasted for years, killing thousands of American soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians. However, it did lead to the capture and execution of Saddam Hussein. Both of these conflicts would last for almost two decades and cost trillions of dollars, with many questioning whether they were worth it. As time passed, the nature of the War on Terror also evolved. Al-Qaeda was weakened but not destroyed, and new terrorist groups emerged, such as ISIS, which gained control of large swaths of territory in Syria and Iraq. The focus of the War on Terror shifted towards counterterrorism operations and drone strikes, targeting suspected terrorists in various parts of the world. There were also concerns about the impact of the War on Terror on civil liberties, as governments implemented surveillance programs and security measures that critics argued violated privacy rights. Today, the War on Terror continues, albeit in a different form. The United States remains engaged in military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and other countries, working with local partners to combat terrorism. But the focus has also shifted towards addressing the root causes of terrorism, such as poverty, political instability, and social inequality. And hopefully we can start to see more peace and less violence in the future.",

    "title": "The Great War",
    "self_text": "I'm just an ordinary man, with an extraordinary destiny. My name is Johnathan Smith. I was born in the state of Kansas, and raised in a small town named Hays. I spent most of my early years on a farm where I worked alongside my father to grow corn and wheat. As a child, I didn't know much about what was happening outside our little bubble, but as I grew older I began to question things. Why did we work so hard only to sell our crops for next to nothing? Why were there so many people who seemed to have more than us? And why did it always seem like the rich got richer while the poor stayed poor? These questions haunted me, and eventually led me down a path that would change my life forever. After graduating high school, I decided to leave home and see the world. I wanted to find answers to my questions, and I believed that traveling would be the best way to do that. So, I packed up my belongings and hit the road. I hitchhiked across the country, taking odd jobs along the way to earn money. I met all sorts of people from different walks of life, and each encounter taught me something new. I learned about the struggles of working-class families, the injustices faced by minorities, and the corruption that plagued our political system. The more I learned, the more determined I became to make a difference. I realized that I couldn't sit idly by while others suffered. I had to use my voice to speak out against injustice and fight for a better world. That's when I discovered politics. I joined a local activist group and started organizing protests and rallies. I quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a leader in the movement. But I knew that if I really wanted to effect change, I needed to get involved at the national level. So, I ran for office. It wasn't easy. I was an outsider, a nobody challenging the established order. But I campaigned tirelessly, speaking directly to the people and sharing my vision for a more just and equitable society. And to everyone's surprise, I won. I became a congressman, representing the people of Kansas in Washington D.C. Now, I finally had a platform to advocate for the causes I believed in. I introduced legislation to raise the minimum wage, expand access to healthcare, and reform our criminal justice system. But I soon discovered that Washington was a swamp of corruption and greed. Powerful lobbyists and special interests controlled the politicians, and they weren't interested in serving the people. They were only interested in protecting their own wealth and power. I fought them tooth and nail, but it felt like I was fighting a losing battle. Then, one day, I received a mysterious phone call. A voice on the other end told me that they could help me expose the truth about what was really going on in Washington. But there was a price. I would have to go undercover, infiltrate the highest levels of government, and gather evidence of their wrongdoing. It was a dangerous mission, but I knew I had no choice. I agreed to become a spy. I quit my job as a congressman and disappeared from public view. I assumed a new identity and started working my way into the inner circles of power. It took months, but eventually I gained the trust of some of the most influential figures in the country. I learned about secret deals, backroom negotiations, and illegal activities that would shock the nation. I gathered mountains of evidence, documenting everything I found. When I had enough proof, I contacted the media and arranged to release the information to the public. The fallout was immediate and explosive. Politicians were arrested, corporations were investigated, and the entire system was shaken to its core. But the forces of darkness wouldn't give up without a fight. They tried to discredit me, smear my reputation, and even threaten my life. But I refused to be intimidated. I continued to speak out, exposing their lies and demanding accountability. In the end, the truth prevailed. The corrupt officials were brought to justice, and the system was reformed. But the war wasn't over. There were still those who sought to maintain their power and control. And I knew that I would have to continue fighting for the rest of my life. Because the fate of our nation, and indeed the world, depended on it.",

They had been at it for hours, both screaming and yelling so loud that our house shook. My parents are very different people; they have completely opposite viewpoints on everything. My mother is very liberal and politically correct, whereas my father is more conservative and thinks most of the things my mom says are ridiculous. But regardless of their differences, they still love each other deeply. After they finished their shouting match, I went to talk to them, hoping to mediate and make peace between the two. I asked my mother why she got so mad and she said, “Because your father doesn’t listen!” Then I turned to my dad and asked him why he didn’t listen, and he responded by saying, “She doesn’t give me time to explain myself!” At first glance, it seemed pretty clear who was right and who was wrong, but after thinking about it for a bit, I realized that they were both right. My mom would get angry because my dad wouldn’t let her finish speaking, and my dad would get angry because my mom wouldn’t let him speak! Neither of them would allow the other to fully express themselves before interrupting and jumping to conclusions. That’s when I realized how important it is to really listen to others without interrupting, and to try and understand where they’re coming from. It’s easy to get caught up in our own thoughts and feelings, but if we want to have meaningful conversations, we need to be able to truly hear what the other person is saying.

The acting is still pretty good though. It’s also kinda cringe how all the characters are constantly saying “I love you” to each other over and over again. Like dude, show don’t tell! We get it, you love each other. No need to keep saying it every five seconds. It just makes it feel less genuine and more forced. Also, max is totally useless now that she’s deaf. What does she even do? Just stand around and look sad? Ugh, i hate that character. She used to be my favorite but now she’s just annoying and pointless. They literally made her completely dependent on lucas for everything. And speaking of lucas, he’s such a whiny little bitch these days. He spends the whole season complaining about how nobody cares about him and how he feels left out. Get over yourself, kid. You’re not the only one who has problems. Everyone else is dealing with their own shit too. And why did they make eddie munson die? That was such a waste of a great character. He was the best part of the whole season and they killed him off halfway through. It’s like they were trying to shock people but it just felt cheap and unsatisfying. I mean, sure, it was sad, but it wasn’t earned. It just felt like they wanted to kill off a fan favorite for no reason. Honestly, this season of stranger things feels like a huge disappointment. It’s not as good as the first three seasons and it doesn’t really add anything new to the story. It’s just a bunch of random events strung together with some half-baked emotional moments.

Everyone with a brain knows that wars are fought over resources, power, money and nothing more. Nobody cares about \"democracy\" or any other idealistic bullshit they try to feed us with through the news. This war isn't about any of that, its about oil and gas. Both Russia and America would happily see each other destroyed if they knew that their own country was safe afterwards. Why do you think the US spends billions of dollars every year funding wars across the world? Its not out of the goodness of their heart. They want control of natural resources and strategic locations around the globe.  Both Russia and America are being controlled by people who don't care about anyone but themselves. In fact, these people probably wouldn't even know where Ukraine is on a map unless someone told them. But regardless, this is how things work.

My friend said that at first his dad wasn't really interested but he eventually decided to check it out because it was free and he had nothing better to do. He said that his dad quickly got hooked on it and started spending hours every day watching porn. He said that his mom was very upset and they fought about it constantly. She tried to get him to stop but he wouldn't listen. Eventually she left him and filed for divorce. My friend said that his dad has been living alone ever since and he spends most of his time watching porn. He said that his dad is very lonely and depressed and he doesn't know what to do to help him. I felt bad for my friend and his dad. It's just a sad story about how something that starts out innocent can turn into an addiction that ruins lives.",

I wouldn’t trade them for anything in the world. It makes me think of my grandfather too. He never had kids himself, but he always treated me like I was his own.

I'm talking about those posts that are supposed to be informative or useful, such as \"how to fix your pc\", \"best way to cook an egg\", etc. These posts are nothing more than SEO bait, designed to attract views from people who don't even know what this sub is about. And while I appreciate the effort to provide helpful information, these types of posts do not belong here. This is a sub dedicated to piracy, specifically pirated movies and tv shows. It's not a general-purpose forum where you can come to ask for help with anything and everything. If you want to share helpful tips or tutorials, please do so in a relevant sub instead. Otherwise, keep this sub focused on its original purpose. I understand that the mods are trying to keep the sub active and engaged, but I think they're going about it the wrong way. By allowing these types of posts, they're diluting the quality of the content and attracting the wrong kind of attention. And frankly, it's just annoying to see my feed filled with stuff that has nothing to do with piracy.  I also disagree with all the changes done by the moderators. In particular, the addition of the new flairs which were meant to categorize posts into categories like 'request', 'help', 'question', etc. Such categorization would be great if the mod team actively moderated the posts that fit under each category (and removed irrelevant ones) but they clearly don't. All that happens is that a user posts a question, adds the tag 'Question', and then no one ever bothers to answer it. Another issue with the new tags is that they require users to select the correct tag before posting. Now, I realize that this is supposed to make things easier for everyone, but it actually does the opposite. It forces users to waste their time selecting a tag that may not even accurately describe their post. And if they choose the wrong tag, their post will be hidden from view. Overall, I think the new changes have made this sub worse, not better. I urge the mods to reconsider their decisions and focus on keeping this sub true to its roots.",

We drove through downtown, looked at all the lights, got some food from McDonalds (we were craving it) and then started heading home. It was probably around 1am or so when we left McDonalds and headed home. My wife wanted me to let her drive so she could “feel alive” after working hard all day. She’s been stressed out recently because of work. I said sure and switched seats with her. Everything seemed okay as we drove along but then everything suddenly turned into a blur. I don’t remember anything other than seeing bright lights and hearing loud noises. I woke up in the hospital with my wife beside me crying. She told me that we had gotten into a car crash and that I was lucky to be alive. Apparently, a drunk driver ran a red light and hit us on the side where I was sitting. The impact was so strong that it sent us spinning out of control and crashing into a nearby building. I was knocked unconscious and didn't wake up until several hours later. My wife and kids were also injured but thankfully they weren’t seriously hurt. They were treated for minor injuries and released from the hospital earlier today. As for me, I have a broken leg, a concussion, and some cuts and bruises. But I’m still alive and that’s what matters most. I’m so grateful to my wife for being such a good driver and for getting us all home safely. And I’m thankful to God for watching over us and protecting us from harm. We lost the car though. It was totaled. But honestly, that doesn’t even matter right now. What matters is that we’re all alive and together. We’ll get another car eventually. But we can’t replace each other.

Just remember that it's only a movie, so don't take anything too seriously. But still, it's a great film overall, and I would recommend it to anyone who loves horror movies.",

It was still worth every second though, and I will remember it forever.  Oh my gosh, it was so magical, like something out of a dream, you wouldn't believe what happened next.

    "self_text": "This is the story of how I ended up on a Christian retreat with my mom, and why I'm now questioning everything I thought I knew about God... \\n\\nI was raised in a very secular household, so I never really had much exposure to religion. My mom, on the other hand, grew up in a strict evangelical family and has always been a devout Christian. We didn't talk about religion much when I was growing up, because we both just kind of agreed to disagree. But as I got older, I started to become more interested in philosophy and science, and I eventually came to the conclusion that there is no evidence for the existence of God. I became an atheist, and I've been pretty vocal about it ever since. \\n\\nMy mom has always been respectful of my beliefs, but she's also always hoped that I would come back to Christianity someday. She's tried to share her faith with me over the years, but I've always politely declined. However, last year, she decided to take a different approach. She invited me to go on a week-long Christian retreat with her. \\n\\nI was hesitant at first, but I figured it would be a good opportunity to spend some time with my mom and learn more about her faith. Plus, I thought it would be interesting to see what a Christian retreat was like. So I agreed to go. \\n\\nThe retreat was held at a beautiful lodge in the mountains. There were about 50 people there, mostly middle-aged women from my mom's church. The days were filled with Bible studies, prayer sessions, and worship services. At first, I felt like an outsider looking in. I didn't understand the language they were using, and I didn't believe any of the things they were saying. But as the week went on, I started to notice something strange. These people weren't just going through the motions. They genuinely believed in what they were doing, and their faith seemed to bring them a lot of joy and peace. \\n\\nI started talking to some of the people at the retreat, and I asked them why they believed in God. Their answers were surprisingly thoughtful and nuanced. They talked about their personal experiences, their sense of purpose, and their belief that God loved them unconditionally. I realized that these people weren't stupid or naive. They were intelligent, compassionate, and deeply spiritual. \\n\\nOne woman told me that she had lost her husband to cancer a few years ago, and that her faith had helped her get through the grief. Another man told me that he had struggled with addiction for most of his life, and that he had found sobriety through Christianity. These stories touched me in a way that I hadn't expected. \\n\\nBy the end of the week, I was starting to question my own beliefs. I still didn't believe in God, but I realized that faith could be a powerful force for good in people's lives. I also realized that I had been too quick to dismiss religion altogether. I had assumed that all Christians were close-minded bigots, but I had met a group of people who were anything but. \\n\\nI left the retreat feeling confused and uncertain. I didn't know what I believed anymore. I still consider myself an atheist, but I'm now open to the possibility that there might be something more to life than meets the eye. And I'm grateful to my mom for giving me the opportunity to experience a world outside of my own.",

My roommate was sitting in his room playing games with his headset on, and he didn’t hear me grunt at first. But then I started grunting again after every time I pushed, and eventually he heard me and asked “Are you ok?” while still having his headset on. I replied back “I'm fine” while continuing to strain and grunt, which made him ask “Dude are you sure? You sound like an animal.” And that’s when I snapped. I got mad because he thinks I'm some kind of animal who can't even use the bathroom without sounding like a fucking boar or something. So I just yelled \"NO! I AM NOT OKAY!\" into the bathroom door while taking another massive push. He quickly pulled off his headset and ran over here, only to see me sitting there with my pants around my ankles trying to squeeze out a turd bigger than my hand.

This sounds like a very bad idea, and as a doctor who doesn’t have any patients at all I would never recommend anyone do this because they are already too sick to travel or go back home. But I will tell you how to get a fake covid test so that when your boss asks for proof of testing negative you don’t feel stuck with no other options. 1. Order a fake PCR test kit online (do some research before ordering). 2. Swab yourself and fill out the results. 3. Edit the results with photo editing software to change the name on the report to match your name. 4. Save the edited report as a PDF file and send it to your employer. You should also be able to print it off and show it to them in person. 5. If asked about the lab, say it is a private lab. They won’t ask any further questions. 6. Remember that lying on official documents is illegal, so only use this method if you really need to. Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice.

It's hard enough to try and not sound like you are trying to make fun of someone or being malicious when you don't know what they've been through in life, but then the powers at be decide to add another emoji that makes it even harder for people to express themselves without accidentally sending out sexual undertones. I'm not saying that there isn't a place for sex, or that people should never talk about sex, or anything of that nature. But sometimes you just want to say \"this is cool!\" or \"that was awesome!\" or \"I'm having a good time!\", and you don't want it to come off as some sort of invitation to go fuck yourself. And now that the new fire emoji has been added, it seems like it will be impossible to express those feelings without somebody getting offended or thinking that you are trying to send them a message.  I have no idea why twitter decided to add this emoji, but it really doesn't feel like something that needs to exist. There were already so many emojis that could convey positive emotions, such as happiness, excitement, enthusiasm, and gratitude. So why did they need to add one more that looks like a flaming penis?

When my mother was pregnant with me, she had been diagnosed with HIV. She took a drug called AZT while she was carrying me to prevent her from passing down the virus to me, which didn't work. It did however cause me to be born with a very low blood cell count and caused me to have a severe immune deficiency when I was born. The doctors told my parents that I would not live past age five, because I couldn't fight off even the simplest infections. My body just wouldn't build up immunity. Every time I got sick, I went into septic shock. But then I started getting better. At first, it was little things like being able to recover faster than anyone else. Then I realized I wasn't getting sick at all. Since birth, I haven't gotten sick once. I don't get colds, flus, or any other common illnesses. I never need to wash my hands, and I can eat whatever I want without getting food poisoning. I also never feel pain. I once broke my arm in two places and didn't even notice until someone pointed it out. That's when I realized I must be different. So I started experimenting. I tried lifting weights, running marathons, and doing other things that normal people can't do. And sure enough, I could do them all. I quickly became the strongest, fastest, and most durable person in the world. I thought I was a superhero, but then I realized I was something more. I was a god. I had powers beyond human comprehension. I could fly, teleport, read minds, and control matter. I could do anything I wanted. But I didn't want to use my powers for good. I didn't want to save the world or help people. I just wanted to have fun. So I decided to become an artist. I used my powers to create incredible works of art that nobody else could ever dream of. I painted paintings that came to life, sculpted statues that moved, and wrote stories that changed reality. I became famous overnight, and everyone wanted to see my work. But I didn't care about fame or fortune. I just wanted to create. One day, I met a woman who loved my art. She was beautiful, intelligent, and kind. She saw something special in me that nobody else had seen before. She helped me to realize that my powers weren't just for fun. They were for something more. Together, we decided to use our powers to make the world a better place. We traveled the world, helping people in need. We healed the sick, fed the hungry, and protected the innocent. We became known as the Guardians of Humanity. But our journey wasn't easy. There were always people who wanted to stop us. People who feared our powers and wanted to control them. But we fought back. We stood up for what we believed in, and we never gave up. In the end, we won. We saved the world, and we made it a better place. But our story doesn't end there. We continue to travel the world, helping people in need. We are still the Guardians of Humanity, and we will always be.",

    "self_text": "Okay, so it's been about six years since I last got drunk and made some bad choices that ended up haunting me for the next two years of my life.  I have been sober ever since then but now I am at a place where I want to revisit those days again.  My friends are trying to talk me out of it, but they don't understand what it is like to be in a position where you just want to forget everything around you for a few hours.  I know if I go down that path there will probably be consequences.  However, I believe it will be worth it if I can find the perfect song to play as I start my descent into the abyss of darkness.  So far all the songs I have found sound too happy or don't really hit home with what I am feeling right now.  Can anyone help?",

    "self_text": "This is how I’m going to describe what each of these two types of people looks like. First off, a bot will say something along the lines of “I am not a bot” but also be unable to do anything that requires an actual brain cell to use and comprehend. Like a simple math question for example. If you ask it “what is 2+2?” and it replies with something along the lines of “I am not a bot”, then congratulations! You have found yourself a robot, as most bots are programmed to not answer questions they don’t know the answer to, but instead make themselves seem human by denying their robotic nature. On the other hand, a retard will reply with something such as “4!” and believe he has answered your question correctly. Both of these types of users can be blocked easily though.",

    "self_text": "I was walking through the streets of Moscow with a girl and her mother when they stopped to talk to some other women that they knew, so I stood there for about ten minutes waiting for them while they chatted away in Russian. Then I started feeling hungry, so I decided to go buy myself something to eat from a shop nearby. I walked into the shop and looked around at all the different kinds of food that they had on offer. There were all sorts of things that I had never seen before, but eventually I settled on a bag of crisps and a bottle of water. I paid for my items and then went back outside to wait for the girl and her mother. They were still chatting away, so I sat down on a bench nearby and started eating my crisps. As I was sitting there, I noticed an old man staring at me. He was dressed in a long coat and hat, and he had a very stern look on his face. I tried to ignore him, but he kept staring at me. Eventually, he came over and started talking to me in Russian. I didn't understand what he was saying, so I just smiled and nodded. He seemed to get angry at this, and started shouting at me in Russian. I was really scared at this point, and I didn't know what to do. Luckily, the girl and her mother finished their conversation and came over to see what was happening. The girl asked the old man what he wanted, and he explained that he was upset because I hadn't acknowledged him properly. She told him that I was a tourist and didn't speak Russian, and he calmed down a bit. He apologized to me and then walked away. I was really relieved that the girl and her mother had intervened, as I don't think I would have been able to handle the situation on my own. It was a scary experience, but it taught me the importance of being respectful of local customs. I also learned that it's always a good idea to learn a few basic phrases in the local language before traveling to a foreign country.",

Their last moment together will go down as one of the most iconic scenes in television history. Joel finds a truck with supplies for Tommy which is great news, however he has to take out many infected along the way. He eventually reaches Tommy at the settlement that he lives in, and finds him doing well and happy. In fact, Tommy’s wife is pregnant so they are going to have another child soon. It is good to see that Joel can visit his brother and know that he is okay after all these years. Ellie asks if she is like the infected. Joel tells her that she isn't because she doesn't need to bite anyone.  The episode ends on a cliffhanger with Joel getting ambushed by raiders while traveling with Ellie to Wyoming.",

At least with Daenerys they could’ve just killed her immediately instead of having her make a whole speech before she got killed. She has been so hot headed for 7 seasons now and then when she finally does snap they let her rant for an hour? It was really bad. Also, they should have made Euron Greyjoy kill Cersei.

The only way I could even think to ask if she was still enjoying herself was because I wanted to make sure she wasn’t getting hurt doing it. So I asked her “are your hands hurting?” And she said “yes”. And I was like “well you should have told me before!” It was like she expected me to know she was in pain! I mean come on now! Why would I know? I'm not a mind reader! I wish people were more direct with their feelings instead of expecting others to guess what they are thinking or feeling. Sometimes, the best way to communicate is just to say what you want and how you feel. That way, there is no room for misinterpretation or misunderstanding. But I guess that's just me. Anyways, back to the story, I didn't realize until she had stopped massaging me for about 5 minutes and started laughing hysterically. Then she explained to me that when she said \"it hurts\" she meant she was orgasming and it wasn't an injury. It's moments like these where I really question everything about my life choices. Is this what love feels like? Being completely clueless about what your partner wants and needs? I don't know, maybe I'm just overthinking things. Maybe she just enjoys messing with me. Either way, I'm glad she's happy. And honestly, I'm kind of relieved that I didn't accidentally ruin anything. But still, I can't help but wonder...what else am I missing? What other subtle cues am I overlooking? Am I doomed to spend the rest of my life stumbling through relationships, constantly misinterpreting signals and making embarrassing mistakes?

I've gotten into situations where I need to borrow money from friends, family, coworkers etc., for emergencies such as car repairs or medical bills and I always tell them \"no problem, just pay me when you get paid\", but it seems like most of the time these folks don't bother. I understand that there is no contract or agreement in place, so I shouldn't expect anything in return, but sometimes I am short on cash myself and was depending on being paid back so I could pay my own bills. In many cases I never bring up the topic again because I don't want to be the bad guy who is nagging their friend or coworker about money. I also feel bad because sometimes I know the person is going through hard times themselves and they simply can't afford to pay me back at the moment. However, after years of lending money out to folks only to never receive payment I've started to realize that maybe I should just stop doing this altogether, regardless of whether the person has a good reason or not. At least if I never lend anyone any money, I won't have to worry about getting screwed over again. So, my question is, should I continue to be generous and helpful by offering to loan money to those in need, or should I just mind my business and keep my wallet closed? I'm starting to think that generosity is overrated and I would rather just save my money for myself. But then I worry that I might come across as selfish and uncaring if I refuse to help someone out during their time of need.

When he did talk about it, he always said that he hated those Germans, they were evil men who killed women and children with no remorse. So when I met my German girlfriend, he went ballistic! I mean full out screaming and yelling at me about how I couldn’t be with someone like that because of what her people had done to him and his friends during the war. My mother tried to reason with him but he wouldn’t listen, she told me that he was very stubborn and hard headed and not to take anything to heart. Well, after several months, he finally calmed down enough to have a conversation with me. And I asked him why he hated Germans so much and he said that they were just bad people who did terrible things and he didn’t want me to get involved with anyone from Germany. So then I told him, “Grandpa, you do know that West Germany became our ally right?” He stared at me blankly for a minute and then he started laughing. He laughed so hard that he almost fell out of his chair. Then he said, “Oh, wow…I guess I hadn’t thought about that.” But it wasn’t over yet! A few weeks later, I brought my girlfriend over to meet him again. She was really nervous about meeting him because she knew how upset he had been before. But he was actually really nice to her this time around. He even offered to make her some tea and cookies! They ended up talking for hours and getting along really well. It turned out that she had a lot of interests in common with him, such as gardening and cooking. And he learned that she was a really kind and compassionate person. He eventually apologized to her for being so rude to her earlier and she accepted his apology graciously. After that, they became really close friends and he would always ask me about her whenever I visited. I think he realized that judging people based on their nationality or ethnicity is wrong and that everyone deserves to be treated with respect. This whole experience taught me a valuable lesson about forgiveness and understanding. It also made me realize that even the most hardened hearts can change. \\n\\nHe still hates them tho. He doesn't let my girlfriend near his garden anymore since she keeps eating all the tomatoes. I don't blame him.",

    "self_text": "I think that Elon Musk is the ultimate example of someone who has more money than brains, and he wants to use his money to buy himself some brains so people will stop making fun of him for being a dumbass. The only problem is that there isn't enough money in the world to buy yourself some brains, because once you have too much money, your brain starts dying anyway. It's like when people get really rich and they start doing weird stuff like buying islands or building giant monuments to themselves. They just lose touch with reality and start thinking they're gods. And then they end up getting into trouble with the law or losing all their money or something. So yeah, Elon Musk is basically a cautionary tale about what happens when you let money go to your head. He's also a pretty good example of why it's important to be humble and not take yourself too seriously. Because if you do, you'll just end up looking like a fool. And nobody wants to be a fool, right?",

I hate that I don’t know how to get out of this cycle because I can’t afford to live without a paycheck and I am too afraid to try something new or different. It would be nice if I could just spend my days making art or playing video games or learning more about space. But no, I have to come here and sit at my desk for eight hours and make fake phone calls to people so that some executives can earn their bonuses. I hope that I can find a way to enjoy life someday. Maybe when I retire, but then again I might not even be alive by then. This is all too much, I think I need to go outside and take a walk. Or maybe I should quit my job right now and become a homeless bum. Either option sounds pretty good to me right now. I want to be able to wake up in the morning and look forward to the day instead of dreading it. I want to be passionate about something other than watching Netflix. I wish I knew what I wanted to do with my life. Maybe I will never figure it out. That thought terrifies me. If anyone else feels the same way, please let me know. Maybe we can start a support group or something. We can meet up once a week and complain about our lives together. I bet there are a lot of people out there who feel lost and alone. I wonder if they ever find happiness? I really hope they do.  I've been thinking about taking up pottery as a hobby. Or maybe learning how to play the ukulele. Something to give me a sense of accomplishment. Anything is better than nothing, right?",

I have been in London for two weeks now, and so far the biggest thing that has struck me as different from back home is how much you guys love queuing up. You will queue up for anything! If there are only three people in a shop, there’s still a line. Even if someone goes out of order, everyone just stands there waiting their turn instead of saying something.  Back home, we would cut or at least make some kind of complaint. It's very strange to watch.  You also seem to be okay with walking on the left side of the road, which really messes with my head because I keep trying to walk on the right side like normal people.  I accidentally walked into a few people when I first got here, but they were polite enough to just say “Sorry” even though it was my fault.  Oh, and the pubs!  They’re amazing.  I went to a pub last night and had a pint of bitter, which tasted exactly like what I expected it to taste.  I don’t know why I thought it wouldn’t, but I did.  And the food!  The fish and chips are incredible.  I haven’t had a bad meal yet.  But honestly, the best part about London is the history.  Everywhere you look, there’s something old and interesting to see.  I visited Westminster Abbey today, and it was breathtaking.  It’s hard to believe that kings and queens have been crowned there for centuries.  I’m definitely going to come back someday.  Okay, well that’s all I have for now.  I hope this gives you a little bit of insight into what it’s like being an American tourist in London.  I’ll try to write another post soon with more observations.  Bye!",

    "self_text": "I've had a pretty good week, mostly because the weather has been nice. I'm also really happy with how things are going at work, even though it is still only temporary employment, but hey, I will take what I can get! I was planning to go out for drinks tonight after work with my friends, but they all cancelled last minute so now I am just sitting here drinking water and watching tv. It's not much of a plan, but honestly I don't think I could handle being around people right now anyway. I'm feeling kinda burnt out and I would rather just spend the night relaxing by myself than forcing myself to be social when I don't feel like it. Also, there were some interesting stories that came up on the news today about Donald Trump Jr, he actually took the stand in court to testify in his father's fraud case. He said that he didn't know anything about any shady business dealings or anything that his father did. The lawyer tried to ask him several questions and he acted as if he had no idea what she was talking about. Of course everyone thinks that he is lying and trying to save his own skin, but who knows what will happen? At least something interesting happened today. This weekend I'm thinking I might finally start working on the painting that I started over a month ago. I got most of the canvas prepped and primed and everything, I just need to actually paint something on it. I've been putting it off because I keep getting scared that it won't turn out well and I will waste all of the money I spent on the materials. But I guess if I never try then I will never know, right? So yeah, hopefully I'll have something cool to show you guys next week. Well, I should probably get back to watching tv now before I fall asleep. Thanks for reading!",

It just wasn't as good as the first two seasons, and I don't think it will ever be again. The writing was bad, the acting was subpar, and the plot was all over the place. I also didn't like the way they handled some of the characters, especially Homelander. He used to be such a complex and interesting character, but now he just seems like a cartoon villain. Overall, I would not recommend Season 3 of The Boys to anyone who is looking for a good show. You should just stick with the first two seasons, or find something else to watch.

I’ve tried everything else; ignoring her, telling her I have a girlfriend, being rude, etc., but nothing seems to work.  She just keeps coming back for more.  The only thing left is to pretend to be a member of an online community such as Reddit or Twitch in order to convince her that my life revolves around these things.  I can make up elaborate stories about my “friends” on there, tell her how much time I spend in those communities, and generally act like I’m living a double life.  This will hopefully bore her into leaving me alone.  It may not be very nice, but she needs to realize that I am not interested in her.  I understand that she might feel hurt, but she has no right to bother me when I’ve already told her multiple times that I don’t want anything to do with her.  If she continues to harass me after this, I will have to take further action, such as filing a restraining order.  But I really hope it doesn’t come to that.  I just want her to go away and let me live my life in peace.",

I don't need validation from anyone. I just like playing games. It's like a little test, seeing how much attention I can get without actually having to put in any effort. It's a way of gauging people's intentions. Are they genuinely interested in me as a person, or are they just looking for a quick fling? If they're just after sex, then I'm not going to waste my time. But if they seem genuine, then I might consider taking things further. I'm not saying that I'm always successful, but when I do succeed, it feels amazing. It's like I've unlocked some hidden power within myself. And that's why I keep doing it. It's addictive. It's empowering. It's fun. It's everything I want in life.

It is also very important to have butter in the pan before you pour the egg mixture into the pan. If you don't do that then the omelette will stick and tear up as soon as you touch it with your spatula. This is why I always use a non-stick frying pan to prepare my omelettes. You can add any kind of ingredients you want in there, but my favorite thing to put inside is cheese! It makes the omelette extra tasty and delicious, like nothing else.  You should try to cook it on low heat for a while to let all of the flavors combine together. Then you can flip the omelette over and cook it for another minute or two. That's how you make the best omelette in the world!",
