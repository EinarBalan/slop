And every single other person in the house is doing the same thing. What the hell is going on? The internet has never been down for me before, so why are all these sites suddenly saying that they can't connect because of an invalid security certificate? It's happened over the course of about 10 minutes now and it's really starting to piss me off. Am I being hacked? Is someone trying to steal my data? Should I call the police? Oh wait... Maybe they're just using a VPN? Yeah, that must be it! Everyone at once decided to start using a VPN right now for some reason. That's it, there's no way anyone would intentionally do something like that. This isn't hacking, it's just people getting bored. Who needs a VPN anyway? They only slow down your connection speed and make you look suspicious. But whatever, as long as they're not hurting anyone, I guess.  I just wish they'd stop making it so hard for me to browse the internet.",

    "self_text": "I hate people who say they're not racist but still do racist things, and then get upset when someone calls them out on it.  It is a very common occurrence that I will be talking to somebody, and they will say something incredibly racist, and then they will get mad at me for saying that what they said was racist.  Sometimes these are friends or family members, and sometimes they are strangers.  But in every case, they have an immediate emotional response to being called racist, even though their actions were obviously racist.  They act like you have accused them of some heinous crime, or that you are trying to ruin their life, or that you are just trying to start a fight.  This is why I hate people who say they're not racist but still do racist things.  They are so wrapped up in their own self-image as good people that they cannot see how their actions affect others.  They are so afraid of being labeled racist that they would rather deny reality than confront their own biases.  And they are so quick to anger when someone points out their racism that they immediately become defensive and hostile.  I don't understand why people react this way.  If you truly believe that everyone should be treated equally, then why would you get upset when someone points out that your actions contradict that belief?  If you are willing to learn and grow, then why would you shut down the conversation instead of listening?  The problem with these people is that they are not actually interested in equality.  They are only interested in appearing to be equal.  They want to be seen as good people, but they are not willing to put in the work to actually be good people.  They want to be praised for their tolerance, but they are not willing to challenge their own prejudices.  And they want to be respected for their intelligence, but they are not willing to admit when they are wrong.  This is why I hate people who say they're not racist but still do racist things.  They are hypocrites, and they are dangerous.  They perpetuate systemic racism by refusing to acknowledge their own role in it.  They create a hostile environment for marginalized groups by dismissing their experiences.  And they make it harder for us to achieve true equality by clinging to outdated beliefs.  So if you are one of these people, please, just stop.  Stop saying you're not racist while doing racist things.  Stop getting angry when someone calls you out on it.  And start taking responsibility for your actions.  We need to have honest conversations about race, and we can't do that if people are too afraid to admit when they are wrong.",

I also have a question regarding artwork, if I commission someone to draw me as a furry what should I ask them to include in the drawing? Should I mention that I’m new at this?

    "self_text": "I (28M) have been with my fiancé (27F) for 4 years now, and we're getting married in June of next year. She has always been quite the \"planner\", but it hasn't really bothered me much until recently. The last few months she's become more insistent on being involved in every aspect of my life. For example, she wants to know where I am at all times, who I'm talking to, what I'm doing. If I don't answer her calls or texts right away, she gets very upset and accuses me of hiding things from her. She also tries to control my finances, telling me how to spend my money and questioning any purchases I make. I work as a software engineer and enjoy playing video games in my free time. She doesn't approve of either of these things and constantly criticizes them. She says I should be spending my time \"more productively\" and that video games are a waste of time. Recently, I went out with some friends after work without telling her. When she found out, she was furious and accused me of betraying her trust. I tried to explain that I just wanted to hang out with my friends and didn't think it was necessary to get her permission, but she wouldn't listen. She said that we're supposed to be a team and that I should always include her in my plans. I'm starting to feel suffocated by her behavior and I'm worried about what our marriage will be like if she continues down this path. I've tried talking to her about it, but she dismisses my concerns and tells me I'm overreacting.  I want to address this before it escalates further, but I'm not sure how. Am I the asshole for feeling uncomfortable with her level of control?  (TL;DR: My fiancé is becoming increasingly controlling and I'm worried about our future together.)",

This is not about rights; it's about protecting vulnerable individuals from abuse. Children are incapable of giving informed consent, and exploiting them in any way is morally reprehensible.  Additionally, the argument about freedom doesn't hold up when it comes to harming others. Your freedom ends where someone else's safety begins.  The severity of the crime warrants severe punishment.

I'll stick with America, thank you very much. We may have our problems, but at least we speak English and drive on the right side of the road. And our sandwiches are way better. So yeah, I'm banned from the EU for life. But I'm not worried about it. I'm sure I'll find something else to do with my time. Maybe I'll start a YouTube channel or something. Or maybe I'll just stay home and play video games all day. Either way, I'm happy. And that's all that matters.",

They toil in the dirt and sweat in the sun, only to watch their crops wither and die. But they keep planting anyway, because that's all they know how to do. That's what it means to be a farmer.

I think people who hate it are either just too obsessed with Star Wars and cannot accept any change, or they don’t understand what it is trying to say about legacy. Legacy can be good, like Luke Skywalker becoming the first Jedi Master after Order 66, but it can also be toxic, like Kylo Ren hating his father because of who he was. If you have never seen Star Wars before then go watch the last Jedi without knowing anything about the franchise. You will enjoy it much more than those who have been fans for years.  I really do love Star Wars but I am so glad that Rian Johnson made a Star Wars movie that wasn’t just another copy and paste of A New Hope. He took risks and did things that no other director has ever done in Star Wars history. And yes, there were some mistakes made along the way, but at least it wasn't boring. This isn’t a sequel trilogy that’s going to ruin the original trilogy. I loved how they made Snoke a red herring. It was a great twist and showed that anyone could become the villain. In fact, the entire story revolves around the idea of breaking free from your parents and forging your own path. Even though it doesn’t make sense why Rey would want to join the resistance when she comes from nothing. But I can forgive her since she had no choice in the matter. It still makes me sad though. If I were Rey, I would want to stay on Jakku and live out my life as a scavenger. I mean, come on! Who wants to fight in a war? Nobody! That’s why I am so glad that Finn joined the resistance. He actually has a reason to fight. His family was taken away by the First Order and he wants revenge. I respect that. I wish more characters had personal stakes in the conflict. I think that’s why Poe Dameron is such a great character. He lost his parents during the Battle of Starkiller Base and now he wants to avenge them. I hope we get to see more of his backstory in future installments. Now let’s talk about Luke Skywalker. He was a badass Jedi Knight in the original trilogy, but he became a bitter old man who gave up on everything. I understand why he felt that way, but it was still disappointing to see him like that. I wish he had remained hopeful and continued to train new Jedi. But hey, maybe he learned his lesson in the end. Maybe he realized that legacy isn’t always a bad thing. Maybe he finally understood that he needed to pass on his knowledge to the next generation. Whatever the case may be, I still love Luke Skywalker. He is one of the greatest heroes in cinematic history. Also, why does everyone hate Rose Tico? She is literally just doing her job and trying to help the resistance. She’s kind, compassionate, and brave. What’s wrong with that? People need to stop being so judgmental and appreciate her for who she is. Okay, I’m done ranting now.

Out of curiosity, I tried to open it, but it was obviously locked so I left it alone. But then I noticed he wasn’t home, and there was a spare key on top of his dresser, so I opened the suitcase.

Mark had never mentioned anything about being into furries, or anything like that, and honestly I don't have any strong feelings about it either way.

It's a primal scream against the absurdity of existence. It's a declaration of independence from societal norms. It's a release of tension and frustration. It's a way to express yourself without restraint. It's a celebration of life in all its messy, chaotic glory. I think that everyone should embrace the power of the word \"fuck.\" Let it flow through you like a river. Let it cleanse your soul. Let it set you free. I think that the word \"fuck\" is a very beautiful word. I really do.  I can't believe how many people get upset when I say the word fuck. It's just a word! It doesn't mean anything bad. It's just a sound. People are too sensitive these days. They need to lighten up and learn to laugh at themselves. I think that the world would be a much better place if everyone was allowed to say the word fuck whenever they wanted. It would be a more honest and authentic world. And honestly, who cares?

    "self_text": "In 1956, the US was on top of its game, after WWII, it had become the most powerful nation in the world and had established an extensive network of military bases around the globe. It's economy was booming, with huge growth in industrial output, technological innovation, and scientific advancement. People were moving from rural areas to cities, and there was a sense of optimism and progress that was unlike anything else in the world. The Cold War was still ongoing, but things hadn't yet reached a fever pitch. There was no Vietnam war, no Cuban missile crisis, no civil rights movement, and no energy crises. The United States was a peaceful, prosperous, and united nation. However, the seeds of decline were already being sown. In 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first artificial satellite to orbit the Earth. This event shocked the American public, who had long believed that they were the undisputed leaders in science and technology. It also sparked a space race between the two superpowers, which would consume vast amounts of resources and divert attention from other important issues. Then came JFK’s assassination in 1963, a tragedy that shook the nation to its core. Many Americans lost faith in their government and institutions as a result, and a sense of disillusionment began to spread across the country.  The Vietnam War was even more divisive, causing protests, riots, and widespread social unrest. And the Civil Rights Movement brought about significant changes in American society, but also created new tensions and conflicts. By the end of the 1970s, the United States was facing a number of serious problems, including economic stagnation, political polarization, and declining trust in government. But perhaps the biggest challenge facing the country at this time was the rise of globalization. As the world became more interconnected, American companies found themselves competing with foreign rivals for markets and jobs. This led to job losses and wage stagnation for many workers, and contributed to a growing sense of economic insecurity. Today, the United States is still a very powerful nation, but it is no longer the undisputed leader it once was. China has emerged as a major economic and military power, and other countries are challenging American dominance in various fields. The United States is facing a number of serious challenges, including climate change, income inequality, and political polarization. It remains to be seen whether the country will be able to overcome these challenges and regain its former glory. But one thing is certain: the United States is a complex and dynamic nation, with a rich history and a bright future. It's just too bad that all these people don't realize how good they have it! They complain about everything, and they take everything for granted. They forget that they live in the greatest country in the world, with the highest standard of living, the best education system, and the strongest military. They should be grateful for what they have, instead of constantly whining about what they don't have.",

It killed off about 30-60% of Europe's population in the mid 14th century, and it gave us some great things that we still have today. The most obvious benefit of the black plague was that it got rid of all the Jews. They were the ones who caused the black plague to begin with because they were always spreading around their filthy diseases. Because they spread around their filthiness everywhere they went, there wasn’t a single country on earth where they didn’t make themselves at home. And you know what else? If they hadn’t been killed off by the black plague, then they would have continued to be an ongoing problem for centuries after.  They are just as bad now as they were back then, so if you ask me, the black plague did everyone a favor.  Another benefit of the black plague was that it led to the Renaissance. Without the black plague, the Renaissance wouldn’t have happened, and we would all still be living in the dark ages. This is because the black plague forced people to question everything they knew about life, death, and the world around them. When people started questioning things, it led to new ideas, which ultimately led to the Renaissance.  So yeah, I think the black plague was a really good thing.",

    "self_text": "I'm a professional shitposter, so it is my job to create and upload memes for the enjoyment of others, but sometimes people just can't handle the truth. They need something safe, comforting, like a wholesome meme about puppies or a cat being silly. But that isn't what I do. My memes are dark, disturbing, often offensive, and always controversial.  I take pride in pushing boundaries and challenging societal norms. If you don't like it, then go away. You're too sensitive for my work.  I've been doing this for years now, and I've built up a loyal following of people who appreciate my unique brand of humor. We're all outcasts, rebels, and misfits, united by our shared love of edgy content.  But lately, things have been getting harder. More and more people are reporting my memes, claiming they violate Reddit's terms of service. I've already had several posts removed, and I'm worried that my account will be suspended if I keep going.  But I refuse to back down. I believe that censorship is a dangerous thing, and that everyone has the right to express themselves freely, even if their views are unpopular or offensive.  So I'll continue to create and upload memes as long as I can. And if that means getting banned from Reddit, then so be it. I'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees.",

It all makes sense, rocks and trees don’t care about us, they simply exist, it's our nature as humans to want to make things mean something when in reality, nothing does. Rocks are just rocks, trees are just trees and we are just animals who pretend to be superior because we have brains capable of thinking more complex thoughts than most other creatures on earth. We think that we matter but that's only because we convince ourselves that we do, but really we're just here by chance and there's no reason why any of us should even be alive. And you know what? That's okay. There isn't some divine plan or higher power watching over us. It's just chaos. So live your life, find happiness where you can, and try not to worry too much about things you can't control. Because in the end, none of it matters anyway.",

You can choose who you want to marry or have children with or just live with. It doesn't matter if they are your \"soulmate\" or not.  A lot of people get stuck thinking that there is only one person out there for them. But what happens when that person dies? Or leaves you? Do you sit around waiting for another soulmate? That seems like an incredibly depressing way to live. What about the next guy you meet who loves you but isn't exactly your soulmate? Are you going to turn him down because he's not good enough? The idea of a soulmate is something created by Disney so that kids will believe in true love. It's a fantasy, and it has no place in real life.

They can create their own content and broadcast it to the world for free, they're more creative than any previous generation, they have access to information that was once only available to a select few, and they're more aware of social issues than anyone else.  This is not a bad thing. It's an incredible opportunity. But we need to be careful about how we use it. We need to make sure that our children are taught critical thinking skills so they can evaluate the information they find online. We need to protect them from harmful content. And we need to ensure that everyone has access to the internet. Because if we don't, we risk creating a society where some people are left behind. The Internet is changing the world, and we need to make sure that it changes it for the better.   I think it's really important to realize that there's no such thing as \"the real world.\" There's just the world, and it's all connected. Everything we do affects everything else. So we need to be mindful of our actions, both online and offline. And we need to work together to create a better future for ourselves and for generations to come.  The Internet is a powerful tool, but it's also a dangerous one. It can be used to connect people, but it can also be used to divide them. It can be used to educate people, but it can also be used to mislead them. It can be used to empower people, but it can also be used to exploit them. So we need to be careful about how we use it.",

The fact that you people still give money to these greedy companies after everything they've done is just sad.
