    "self_text": "I paid $4,000 for it back in 2018 and it only had 75,000 miles on it.  It was a beautiful red Mustang GT with black leather seats and a powerful engine.  I loved that car so much and drove it every day for years.  I’d take it to the beach and drive it around town.  But then my dad got sick and needed some money for medical bills, so I sold it for $13,000.   It still makes me sad when I think about it.  I really miss that car.  I wish I hadn't sold it.  I wish I could have kept it forever.  I just don’t know why I did what I did.  I probably didn’t want to spend all of my money on myself because I wanted to be able to help my family.   It was stupid at the time but now looking back it was probably the right decision. I just felt like a selfish person at the time.  I never told anyone how much that car meant to me.  I was afraid they would judge me or tell me that I should have kept it.   But it was my favorite possession.  I was so happy when I had it.  Now I don't even remember what it sounded like.   When I put it up for sale I was too ashamed to admit that I loved it.   So I lied about its condition and told people that it was in good shape.   I knew that was wrong.   I shouldn’t have done that.   I should have been honest with them.   I am not sure if I will ever get another car again.   My old man told me he wasn’t gonna give me any money for the repairs on the car and I was so angry and upset.  He said that he could buy me a new car but I didn't want him to do that because I didn’t want to be indebted to him.   I felt like he was trying to control me.   I thought he was being mean and disrespectful.   I didn’t want to be his daughter anymore.   I wanted to run away from home and live on my own.   I thought that I would be free if I left my parents behind.   But I realized that I couldn't survive without their support.   They always took care of me.   They gave me everything I needed.   They were there for me through thick and thin.   I can’t imagine my life without them.   I love them so much.   And I hate myself for letting them down.   I need to make things right.   I need to apologize to them.   I need to try to earn their trust again.   I need to let them know that I appreciate them.   I need to forgive myself.   I need to learn from my mistakes.

I told her I just like to listen to music when I do my homework, but then she said that it’s not normal for you to turn your phone on so loud while doing homework. She said that if I wanted to listen to music, I should turn my phone off and use headphones or an external speaker.   I was like “but I don’t have headphones” and she replied “then buy some.”   I ended up getting some cheap ones from amazon today and now they are in my bag.  If anyone wants to know what I am listening to let me know and I will add you to my playlist.",

    "self_text": "When I was young, the world was a playground full of possibilities. I would run around with my friends, building castles in the sand and making up stories as we went along. I loved exploring new places, discovering hidden trails and marveling at the beauty of nature. There were no worries or anxieties back then, just pure joy and excitement for life. But now that I'm older, things have changed. The world can be a difficult place sometimes, filled with challenges and setbacks. It's easy to get caught up in the negativity and lose sight of what truly matters. However, I want to remember those days and keep them alive by taking action today. So here’s what I do. 1) I try to stay positive, even when things are tough. 2) I make time for activities that bring me joy, like reading, hiking, or spending time with loved ones. 3) I practice gratitude, appreciating everything I have in my life. And most importantly, I never stop learning and growing. I know there will always be obstacles in my path, but I’m determined to overcome them and live a fulfilling life.  I hope you guys had an amazing day! Don't forget to eat your vegetables! 😂",

I also like how my parents keep saying “you don’t have to eat your vegetables” but then they will leave me some in the fridge for me to eat later, which is nice.  I think it’s really cool that my mom has a job where she can work from home.   I know I could do that too if I was older. I would probably go out and get myself a good laptop and a big desk so I can be more productive. I also love how my dad takes his dog everywhere he goes. It's cute when he does that.  I feel bad for people who don’t have dogs because I think they are amazing animals.  I hope I can own a dog someday, maybe a golden retriever or a labrador. They seem very friendly and smart. I am hoping I can get into a college soon so I can start working toward having a career that I enjoy.  My dad says I should pick something that pays well and also something that I am passionate about.  That is kind of hard to find, but I think I can do it.  I just need to be patient and work hard at it.  I am excited to see what the future holds for me. I hope I will have lots of friends and family around me to support me. And I hope I will travel the world and experience different cultures.  I want to visit Europe and Asia.  Maybe Japan or South Korea.  I also want to visit Canada.  And Australia.  It sounds like it would be an amazing place to live.   What do you guys think?",
