    "self_text": "I have been playing tennis for 10 years and just started college this year. But there is a clear gap between the players at UCLA and other schools. The most obvious difference is the lack of consistency in their shots. They don't seem to know how to be consistent, as they often hit balls that go out or miss the target completely. They also seem to not know what to do when an opponent comes up on them, but then immediately lose composure and start to panic. It's frustrating to watch, and it makes me wonder why they can't improve.",

Answer : The amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1g of water from 25 degrees C to 100 degrees C is 76.3 J/g.   Question 2 : A student has a piece of metal that he believes is iron. He weighs it on a balance scale and finds that it weighs 84 grams. If iron has a density of 7.87 g/mL, what is the volume of the metal? Answer : Volume = mass / density = 84g / 7.87g/mL = 10.6 mL  Question 3 : How many molecules of oxygen are contained in a sample of air that has a pressure of 101 kPa at a temperature of 25°C? Answer : Pressure = 101 kPa; Temperature = 25°C; R = 8.314 J/molK; Molar Mass of Oxygen = 16 g/mol  Question 4 : Why do people say that the atmosphere is like a blanket? Answer : Atmosphere is like a blanket because it contains gases that trap heat from the sun. Without them, the Earth would be too cold for life to exist. So they work as insulation to keep us warm. Question 5 : Explain why ice floats in water. Answer : Ice floats in water because ice is less dense than liquid water.  Can someone please explain why these answers are wrong?",

It's not always easy, but it’s possible with some effort from both sides. Here are some tips on how to create a good roommate relationship:  1. Discuss Expectations Early On.   When you first meet your roommate, have a conversation about what matters most to each of you and how you plan to live together. Don’t wait until the day you move in to start talking.  2.  Be Respectful.   Respect your roommate’s privacy, space, belongings, and schedule.   3. Communicate Openly and Honestly.  If something bothers you or if you need help, let your roommate know as soon as possible.  4. Be Flexible.   Life happens, so sometimes things won’t go according to plan. It’s important to be flexible and willing to compromise.  5. Spend Time Together.  Even if you don’t always agree on everything, spending time together can help build a strong bond.  6. Support Each Other.   Support your roommate when they’re struggling and celebrate their successes.  7. Don’t Assume.  Don’t assume you know what your roommate wants or needs.  8. Give Space When Needed.   Sometimes people just need some alone time.  9.  Clean Up After Yourself.   This is a basic rule of living with anyone, but it’s especially important when sharing a room or apartment.  10. Be Considerate.   Consider your roommate’s feelings and needs when making decisions.  Here are some other tips to consider:   - Create a shared calendar to keep track of schedules. - Set ground rules for guests. - Establish a cleaning routine. - Have regular check-ins to discuss any concerns.   Creating a good roommate relationship takes work, but it can pay off big time. If you follow these tips, you’ll increase your chances of having a positive and enjoyable living experience.

    "self_text": "Okay, so for the sake of argument, let’s assume that you have all of these items in your kitchen and are making a cup of coffee as we speak.   What is the most important thing to consider when making coffee?   For me, it would be temperature.  The water needs to be hot enough to extract flavor from the coffee beans but not so hot that it burns them. It's often suggested that the ideal temperature is between 195°F and 205°F (90°C - 96°C). This is because at those temperatures, the volatile aromatic compounds in the coffee will be extracted efficiently without over-extracting the bitter flavors. But how do you know if the water is the right temperature? You can use a thermometer to check, or simply watch for small bubbles forming on the bottom of the pot.   But what about grind size? The best grind size depends on the brewing method you're using. For example, French press requires a coarse grind, while espresso requires a fine grind. What's the perfect grind size for pour over?   Also, I’m just starting out, so I don’t want to waste too much money by buying fancy equipment. Any tips or suggestions?",

The campus itself seems nice, with plenty of green space and some cool buildings.  However, I also noticed that it can be quite crowded, especially around the main quad. It felt like every single square inch was occupied by students or visitors. I think the sheer size of the university means that it’s difficult to get away from the crowds, even if you want to.  But overall, the campus does seem really impressive. The architecture is beautiful, and the location is fantastic—right near Westwood Village, which has tons of restaurants and shops.
