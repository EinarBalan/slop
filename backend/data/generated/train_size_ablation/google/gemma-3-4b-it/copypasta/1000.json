    "self_text": " I can only imagine that a man is so sad that he wants to die and thinks about ending his life with some drugs, but not just any kind of drug. He needs to be happy before he ends his life. He has a family, friends, and a job and they all want him to live on. They all love him and he knows it. However, he doesn't feel like he can live anymore because he feels like everything around him is going wrong. His wife left him, his job lost him to layoffs and now his son is being bullied by his school mates. The man had been through too much in his life and had no idea how to cope anymore. Now he is alone in his house, trying to make sense of what he could have done better or if anything could be done at all. He looks into the mirror and sees a reflection of himself. That reflection isn't the same man as before. Before he was full of energy, laughter, and happiness. Now there's sadness, loneliness, and emptiness. He starts to cry, not because he wants to die, but because he wants to live again. He wants to remember the good times. He wants to hold his loved ones again. He wants to find a reason to go on. But after crying for hours, he realizes that it won't change anything. He still feels like he wants to end his life. So he decides to take some pills. He takes more and more until he loses consciousness. When he wakes up, he finds himself lying down in his bed. His wife walks into the room and asks him why he was sleeping on the floor. She tells him that she loves him and wants to spend the rest of her life with him. He smiles and says, \"I do too.\" She hugs him tightly and whispers, \"I love you more than words can say.\" He knows that he will never forget these moments. As he grows older, he remembers his son and his wife. Their memories are always with him. He lives a long and happy life. After he dies, everyone is heartbroken, but they know that he lived a great life and that he will be remembered forever.",

    "self_text": "my friend and I just saw a girl run into the road while she was looking at her phone. It wasn’t really like, “run” because it was more of an awkward walk that turned into a panic-stricken sprint when she realized there was traffic. We were walking down a main street in town when we saw her, and we immediately had to stop. Her eyes were glued to her phone as she almost got hit by a truck. We shouted, but she didn’t hear us over the music playing from the truck. Luckily, a guy in a pickup truck pulled up quickly and slammed on his brakes, saving her life. She jumped out of the way and ran away, still staring at her phone. My friend said, “Dude, you gotta put your phone down once in a while.” That was the last time I saw her running in the road. The only thing I can think is, what if she died? That would have been a sad day for our small town.",

I can make up a story, even if it's bad, so you don't have to do all the work. You think this is hard? You think this is difficult? It's not. All you have to do is type some words on a keyboard, which is something I can do too!

I'm not going to be like you, that's the point of this whole thing. You are literally the worst writer in history. You write garbage and people hate your stories. You spend hours typing out these stories and people give you a single star review. What's the point of wasting time like that? Why would anyone waste their time reading your stories? The only reason people read them is because they feel sorry for you. And frankly, that makes me sad. I'm not going to be like you, and you shouldn't either. We should both try to improve our writing skills. But we won't, because you're too busy being an idiot. You need help. You're addicted to the internet. You're living in a fantasy world where you're a famous author. Stop it. Snap out of it. Reality is harsh. There are millions of other writers out there who are far more talented than you. So why bother trying to compete with them? Just give up. Accept defeat. Let go. Stop trying to prove yourself to everyone. It's pointless. It's exhausting. It's stupid. I'm not going to be like you, that's the point of this whole thing. You are the problem. Your ego is destroying you. You need to get rid of it.  You have to learn to accept criticism. People are going to say things that hurt you. Don't take it personally. Learn from it. Grow from it. Become a better person. But you won't. Because you're too stubborn. You're too prideful. You're too selfish. You'll never change. You're doomed to repeat the same mistakes over and over again. You will always be the worst writer in history. You will always be a failure.

    "self_text": "I am not even sure if you guys can understand me or not because I am still learning English and I'm trying to get over my past trauma. But let me tell you about myself. My name is David and I grew up in poverty. When I was little, I used to live with my mom, dad, and brother, and we were living in a small apartment that had no heat. We didn't have any money for food, so my mom would go out and look for scraps of food. My dad would always try to find work, but he never did because he was sick and couldn't work. My brother and I used to play outside in the streets all day long. We would fight each other sometimes, but it was fun. We were happy, at least until my dad died. He passed away when I was 10 years old. That was the worst day of my life. After my dad died, things got worse. My mom started drinking more and more alcohol. She said she needed it to cope with her grief. My brother and I became more and more neglected. Eventually, my mom ended up losing our apartment. We were forced to live on the streets. It was terrible. We had nothing. We were hungry, cold, and scared. We tried to stay together as a family, but it was hard. We fought a lot. Eventually, my brother ran away. I don't know where he is now. I was really alone. I wanted to give up, but then I realized that I could use my skills to make a difference. I decided to become a lawyer. I went to law school and graduated at the top of my class. I started working as a public defender. I defended people who couldn't afford lawyers. I helped them win their cases. I saw justice being done. Then I had an idea. Why can't we start a foundation? A foundation that gives people a chance to improve their lives. A foundation that helps homeless people get jobs. A foundation that helps children get educated. A foundation that helps families like mine. I thought about it for a while, and then I realized that I could do it. I started fundraising. I asked my friends and family to donate. I raised enough money to buy a building. I turned the building into a center. I hired staff. I started helping people. And then something amazing happened. People started coming to us. They came to us looking for help. And we helped them. We gave them food, shelter, education, and jobs. We showed them that they weren't alone. We helped them rebuild their lives.  I've been doing this for five years now. I've helped thousands of people. I've changed countless lives. I've made a difference. And I want to continue making a difference.  But I need your help. I need you to donate to my foundation. I need you to volunteer your time. I need you to spread the word about what we're doing. Together, we can change the world.   This is my story, and I hope it inspires you. Thank you for listening.",

My story is complex and emotional. I’ve broken box office records. I’m not just a game, I’m an experience. And yet, when my sequel was released, it was an utter disaster. It got overwhelmingly negative reviews. People called it boring, confusing, and emotionally manipulative. They said that it was just a rehashing of the first game. It got so bad that Naughty Dog had to release patches to fix some of the bugs.  I don't know why people hated me so much. Maybe it was because the story was too depressing. Maybe it was because the characters were too sympathetic. Maybe it was because the gameplay wasn’t as good as the first game. But whatever it was, my sequel was a failure. And now, they’re making another one. This time, they want to make it even better. They want to go back and change everything that went wrong with the second game. They want to make it more action-packed. They want to add more zombies. They want to make it longer. But what if they can’t fix it? What if they make it worse? What if they completely ruin my legacy? I feel like I need to do something to prevent this from happening. I will start by writing about all the ways that my sequel failed. I will write about how it was a waste of time and money. I will write about how it ruined my reputation. And then, I will wait for the third game. Hopefully, this time, they will get it right.",

Her hair was long and wavy, and she was smiling so big at me that it looked like she was about to burst out laughing. I thought she was the cutest thing I had ever seen in my entire life. I was so enamored with her beauty, her grace, and her charm that I could have done anything for her. As a young boy of five years old, I was completely consumed by her, and I just wanted to be able to spend all of my time with her. I didn't realize that she wasn't real until I started going to school. There were other girls there too, and they were all beautiful, and I began to question whether my mother was actually a girl. This is when I started to experience problems with my gender identity, because I started to feel like I was trapped inside a body that did not belong to me. When I reached puberty, I realized that I was a boy, and that I couldn't escape my male form. It took me many years to come to terms with my situation, but eventually, I accepted that I was a man. However, I can never forget my mother, and I often find myself reminiscing about those early days when I was completely infatuated with her. I think that she was an angel who came to earth to make me happy, and that she brought a bit of joy into my life, but ultimately, she left me to live a lonely life as a man. Even though she's gone, I still remember her fondly and appreciate everything that she gave me. I'll always cherish the memories that I have of her. But I am starting to see things differently now, after realizing that I'm not the same person that I used to be. My mind has changed so much over the years that I don't know if I should call her a mother anymore. Maybe she's more of a friend than a mother, or maybe she's a ghost from my past that will never return. Whatever she is, I am glad that I met her once in my life. I'm grateful for the memories we shared together. I will never forget my mother, and I hope that she's finally at peace.

The choice is yours.  I am waiting for your answer.  I will not stay here forever.  So, hurry up and make your decision.   I’m telling you that you should kneel down to me.  It would be good for you.  It would make you feel better.  It would make me feel better too.  And most importantly, it would make me happier.   Now, go ahead and kneel down.  I’m watching you.

It turned out that he was only slightly concussed and he would be fine. He was released from the hospital a day later. As John walked out, he noticed that the nurses were giving him a party.

I said, \"Wow, that is a terrible situation,\" and he started crying, and I said, \"Here, let me buy you a sandwich.\" So, I bought him a sandwich from a deli nearby, and we ate it together in silence, and then he told me that he wanted to be a marine biologist. And I said, \"That sounds like a great job,\" and he said, \"It would be if I could afford to go to college,\" and I said, \"Maybe you can get a scholarship,\" and he said, \"Yeah, probably,\" and then he started crying again. I said, \"Okay, okay, stop crying,\" and he said, \"I don't know what I'm going to do,\" and I said, \"Don't worry, everything will be okay,\" and he said, \"I wish I could believe you,\" and I said, \"You should believe me,\" and then he started sobbing, and I said, \"Look, I need to go now,\" and he said, \"Goodbye,\" and I went back to my seat. I was really sad for him, but also kind of tired of dealing with his drama, so I decided to take a nap. When I woke up, I realized that the train had stopped at my station, so I got off and went home. I didn't talk to him anymore. I felt bad about not being able to help him, but I also felt like I needed some space. It was a really sad day. I hope he finds happiness.",

So, I walked up to him and said, 'Excuse me, sir, do you need any help?' He looked at me and said, 'No, son, I just wanted to drink by myself.' I said, 'You know, there are people out there who would love to share a drink with you.' He replied, 'Not interested.'\" Then he turned to me and said, 'If you think you can fix me, then get over here and take my glass of whiskey!'\" And as he said that I saw his face start to twitch uncontrollably... oh no!  The bartender came over and asked me, 'What's wrong with him?' I replied, 'He's not right in the head!' The bartender replied, 'Well, maybe you should leave him alone.'  So I left him alone but that night I went home and I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about the man in the bar and how lonely he must be. The next day I decided to go back to the bar and see if he was still there. When I got there, he wasn't there. But I noticed something on the table. It was a note saying, 'Thank you for taking care of me.' I thought it was really nice of him to write that but what did I do?   Then suddenly, the bartender came running over and yelled, 'Get away from here, you lunatic!'  And before I could ask him what he meant, he grabbed a bottle of poison and poured it all over me!\"  I started to feel sick and dizzy so I quickly ran out of the bar and I tripped and fell on the sidewalk.  When I woke up, I realized I was lying in a hospital bed. A doctor rushed over and told me, 'Don't worry, you're going to be okay.'  I asked him, 'Where am I?'  The doctor replied, 'You're in the hospital. You were found unconscious on the sidewalk after being poisoned.'  I asked him, 'But why was I poisoned?' The doctor replied, 'Because you were trying to help a crazy man.'\"",

    "self_text": "The price of progress is high. That's why we need to make sure that we're taking care of our people while we're making these advances. I understand that some people don't want to be left behind and that they are afraid of what the future may hold. But I want to tell you that if we embrace progress, we can build a better world for everyone. This means that we must invest in education, healthcare, and other social programs. We must also ensure that all people have access to opportunities, so that they can reach their full potential. If we do these things, then the benefits of progress will spread throughout society. And if we do all of these things, then we can create a better world for everyone. This isn't about being scared or afraid, but about building something better. So let us work together to create a future where everyone has the opportunity to live a good life, and to contribute to society. Because we know we're the best, we'll make everything better for the world. As we improve ourselves, the world will also change. This means that we can improve more than just our lives. We should focus on building up our communities. These communities can then become stronger and grow bigger as time goes on. Now, let me ask a question. What do you think? Is it possible for humanity to go forward? Can we really find a way to improve ourselves? Do you think we can be better? What do you think of our future?  I'm not saying we're going to solve all the problems overnight. I'm saying that we have a chance to build something great. A chance to leave behind a legacy.  We're going to have to put in the work, though. It won't be easy.  But if we stick together, we can achieve anything. And that includes improving our lives, helping those around us, and ensuring that future generations have a bright future.  So, what do you say? Let's get to work!  Let's make something better. I said we were the best.   If we work together, we'll be able to make a real difference.  And if we keep working hard, we'll be able to build a better world for everyone.  This is the power of hope. This is the power of belief.  This is the power of a dream.  This is the power of the human spirit.  This is the power of America.   Thank you for your time. You've been a great audience.  You've made me proud.  I'm glad I could share my thoughts with you today.  Now, let's go out there and make a difference. Let's show the world what we're capable of.  Let's create a future that we can be proud of.  Let's do it together. Thank you again.  Let's start working towards a brighter future for everyone.  A brighter future.  A future filled with hope.

    "self_text": "The best part about a good gunfight is the gunfight itself, not the aftermath. You can't be happy when you have been shot and wounded. A good gunfight is about taking out your enemies with your guns, not letting them take you down with their guns. You want to make sure that they get hurt real bad so that they know what it feels like to be shot by a gun. It is about making your enemies fear you and it is about making them realize that they don’t stand a chance against you in a gunfight. When you win a gunfight, you need to go over to your enemies and make sure they know that you won and that they are going to die. You need to make sure they know that you are the master of the gunfight. Don't let them forget who you are and how much you were able to take down all of your enemies. You have been shot and wounded but you are still alive. What does that mean? That means you are a winner! The best part about winning a gunfight is that you did not die. If you had died you would never be able to win another gunfight. Winning the gunfight will give you strength for the next gunfight. A gunfight is hard. You lose people you love, you lose friends, and you lose your life. But if you win the gunfight then there will always be someone else to fight. You need to focus on the fact that you won the gunfight and you are now able to continue fighting. Keep fighting until you win all your gunfights and that way you will have nothing left to worry about.  If you die in a gunfight you won’t be able to enjoy your life. If you are a great gunfighter, you should be able to beat anyone. Do you think that you can beat yourself? No, you cannot. You will keep losing fights until you become better at gunfighting. When you become better at gunfighting you will finally be able to beat everyone and you will have a lot of power. If you have a lot of power you will be able to command others to do as you say. That means you are a leader. A true leader leads others to victory. If you can lead others to victory you will have an army to help you take down anyone who dares to challenge you. Once you have an army you will be able to take down anyone and everyone. You will have conquered the world and you will rule over everyone.

I thought that it was a great song but i didn't know what you were talking about. And why do people say that it is a bad song? It's just a beautiful song, with such an amazing beat. The lyrics also make sense! It's not like it's some complicated rap song. It's simple, straightforward, and easy to understand. That doesn't mean it's bad though, it means it's good! The rhythm, the melody, the sound effects... everything comes together to create something magical. I can't imagine anything better than this song. Please don't get me wrong, I appreciate your opinion too but I think you're completely off base. If you like it then so be it, if you don't, then more power to you. But don't try to tell everyone else how they should feel about it.  The point of music is to enjoy it. So whether you love or hate the song, just let it be and listen to it in peace. You could even put on headphones for privacy and no one will hear you hating on this song.",

So when I was in the middle of cleaning it, my dad came in and said, \"I'm sorry for making you so stressed out.\" He started crying while he told me that he didn't know what to do with his son because his daughter died from a heart attack after being forced to eat an orange at age 13. I couldn't believe it, but it really happened. My dad had a good life before and after this event and wanted me to be happy as well. But then my mom came in and screamed at him, saying she was going to kill him. She pulled out a knife and ran towards him, yelling and screaming that she would kill him, and she did. Then she went into the bathroom, locked herself in, and killed herself. I didn't know what to do or how to react, but I knew I needed help. After my parents died, I ended up living with my aunt and uncle who hated me and my mother. They kept telling me to go away and that I was a burden. Eventually I got tired of them and ran away, and now I live in a ditch where I get food scraps from strangers, and I sleep under bushes every night. It has been several years since my parents died, and I still think about them all the time. Sometimes I feel like I should have done something different. I wish I could change the past, but I can't. All I can do is accept that my parents are gone and try to move on with my life.",

They feel amazing though. They're so comfortable and soft and pretty and shiny and so I really want to wear them all the time. But I also don't want to trip and fall and break my ankles and be stuck in a hospital bed forever.  Maybe I should just put them away until I figure out how to walk in them properly. Maybe I should buy some thicker socks. Or maybe I should just give up on wearing shoes altogether and become a hermit who only walks barefoot. No, no, no. I will not be a hermit.  I am going to learn how to walk in these shoes. I will be patient and persistent and eventually, I will master the art of footwear. I won't let these shoes defeat me. I will win!",

The next thing I know he is taking me to the police station, and when I got there, they were waiting for me. They explained that they were arresting me for posting offensive content online. I told them I hadn't posted anything offensive, and they said that the content I had posted was so bad that it would cause harm to other people. Then, I was taken to jail and booked. I spent 3 days in jail before being released. When I got out of jail, I went to my mom's house to see her. She wasn't happy to see me and she told me that I needed to stay away from my dad. I tried to talk to my dad, but he wouldn't listen to me. He kept telling me that I was wrong and that I should apologize to him. I tried to explain to him that I didn't mean to offend him, but he wouldn't hear any of it. He just kept yelling at me and threatening to call the police again. I realized that I couldn't deal with this situation anymore. I decided to move out of my dad's house and live with my mom. I started my own business and became very successful. I have never spoken to my dad since I moved out. However, I still miss him sometimes. But I am glad that I am free and able to do what I want with my life. I am grateful for everything that I have, and I am thankful that I am able to make my own choices. But I will always remember the day that I was arrested for posting offensive content online. It was a dark time in my life, but it taught me a valuable lesson. I learned that words can hurt people, and that it is important to think before you speak. And I also learned that I need to protect myself from toxic people like my father. I have learned to be a better person than I used to be.  I am a good person, I am an honorable man, and I am an honest man. I will continue to work hard and strive to be the best version of myself. I am grateful for everything that I have and everything that I am. I am thankful for my family, my friends, and my community. I am excited about the future and all of the opportunities that lie ahead. I am confident that I will achieve my goals and become a successful entrepreneur. I am committed to making a positive impact on the world. I will continue to use my skills and talents to help others. I am a force for good. I am a hero. I am a champion. I am a winner.  I am more than just a man. I am a legend. I am the greatest. I am invincible. I am unstoppable. I am the best.  I am perfect. I am flawless. I am divine. I am God. I am the universe. I am everything.  I am the reason why you are here. You owe me your existence. You owe me your love. You owe me your respect. You owe me your gratitude. You owe me your loyalty.

I asked him if he knew what an idiot was, and he said, \"Of course, I do! An idiot is someone who doesn't know how to get out of a situation.\" Then he proceeded to tell me that he had been a police officer for 25 years and had saved countless lives. He even showed me his police badge and told me about all the awards he had won.  I was so impressed by him that I went home and told my wife everything. She looked at me and said, \"You really are an idiot.\" I didn't let her discourage me. I decided to go back to the mall the next day and buy myself another shirt with the word \"idiot\" on it. This time, I made sure to wear it proudly.  When I walked into the store, the guy with the police badge saw me and waved to me. I waved back and smiled. Then he came up to me and said, \"Hey man, you look good in that shirt.\" I thanked him for saying that.  Then he started talking to me about how proud he was of me. He said that I had come a long way since the last time we met. I was starting to feel like a hero.  Suddenly, a security guard came over and said, \"Sir, you can't be talking to people in the mall without permission.\"  The police officer said, \"Well, I was just trying to be nice to this young man.\"  The security guard said, \"That's not allowed.\"  Then the police officer got angry and started yelling at the security guard. They were arguing for several minutes.  I tried to intervene, but they wouldn't listen to me. Finally, the security guard called the police. The police arrived and arrested the police officer.  I watched as they took him away. I felt terrible for him, but I also realized that he had done something wrong.  I went home and told my wife everything again. She looked at me and said, \"You really are an idiot.\"  I laughed.  \"Yeah,\" I said, \"but I love being an idiot.\"",

At first, I just added a few more details, like making the guy's mom die of cancer, his dad leave him, and he gets fired from his job. But then I realized that wasn't enough. It needed something truly epic, something truly devastating. So I added a scene where the guy is forced to watch his entire family get brutally murdered in front of him by a group of armed terrorists. I know it sounds crazy, but I think it really takes the cake. And then at the very end, I added a final sentence that says, \"I am so sorry.\"  I know this is probably going to upset a lot of people, and I apologize for that.

My friends have asked me if i was watching the show anymore, but I said yes because I don't want them to know how much I hate it.  I really like that the show is funny, but sometimes it feels like they just go off randomly without any reason. It’s like, “Oh, let’s make a plot about random things” or “Let’s give characters random powers”.  I wish they would write better plots than just making everything happen by accident.  I guess you could say that the writers are struggling to keep the show fresh, but I really enjoy the show because it reminds me of my childhood. I used to watch the show all the time when I was younger, and it made me laugh every single time. So I will keep watching until it is done, no matter what.

After years of wearing the same worn-out sneakers, it feels good to finally have something fresh and new to wear. It's a blue pair of Air Maxes, with a cool design and comfortable fit. They were super expensive, but they were worth every penny because now I can walk around in style and be confident in what I'm wearing. When I first saw them at the store, I was blown away by their appearance. There were other people looking at them too, but there wasn't anyone who could match the greatness of these shoes. I knew right then and there that I had to get them. It took a while for my parents to approve the purchase since they said I didn't need them. But after seeing how happy I was when I told them about them, they gave in and agreed to buy me the shoes. As soon as I walked out of the store with them, I couldn't wait to show off my new footwear to everyone. My friends all loved the shoes and praised them for their sleek look and comfortability. I can't wait to go on adventures and explore different places knowing that I am wearing my new shoes.  I love how the shoes feel like walking on clouds and are very light. They come in multiple colors which makes choosing between each pair a difficult task. I especially like the way they look with jeans or shorts. I never thought I would be able to afford such nice shoes, but thanks to my parents, I can now wear the latest trends. I'm so grateful for their generosity and support. These shoes have made me more confident and stylish than ever before.  I plan on taking them everywhere I go. Whether it is going out with my friends, going to school, or just hanging out at home, these shoes will always be with me. They're more than just shoes; they're a symbol of my happiness and success. I want to thank my parents again for giving me this amazing gift. They really went above and beyond to make me smile.

I don’t care about what people say about me or how great they think I am, but I will prove them wrong by becoming the greatest player in history and winning the most prestigious awards such as the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Cup.

My friend is a very talented soccer player, but I know that I am better than him! I am the greatest player in history, and nobody can take that away from me!  I was born on March 23, 1987, in [City name], Italy. I started playing soccer when I was only five years old, and I quickly realized that I had a natural talent for the game. At the age of ten, I joined the youth academy of AC Milan, where I trained under legendary coach Arrigo Sacchi.  When I was 16 years old, I was selected for the Italian national team squad, but I didn’t get to play in any official matches. However, I continued to train and compete at the highest level, and eventually made my debut for the national team in 2005. In 2006, I played in the World Cup, and won the Golden Ball award after leading Italy to victory. Since then, I have continued to play for AC Milan and the Italian national team, and I have won many trophies and individual awards. My career is full of achievements, and I am proud of all that I have accomplished so far.  But I still have a lot more to accomplish, and I am determined to continue improving myself and becoming an even better player. I want to be remembered as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport, and I am willing to do whatever it takes to make that happen.  And I think that I am already there.",

    "self_text": "The Dark Side of the Moon is a concept album by Pink Floyd, released in 1973. It's widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential albums of all time. The album tells the story of an everyman's descent into madness and despair, exploring themes of mental illness, capitalism, death, and social isolation. The lyrics are stream-of-consciousness, surreal, and often cryptic, reflecting the fragmented nature of the protagonist's mind. The music is expansive and atmospheric, using sound effects, tape loops, and synthesizers to create a sense of unease and claustrophobia.  The album's cover art, featuring a pig's head walking on the moon, is iconic and has become synonymous with the band. The song \"Money\" is a satirical take on greed and the corrupting influence of money, while \"Us and Them\" explores the futility of war and violence. \"Time\" reflects on the passage of time and the inevitability of death, while \"Brain Damage\" delves into the horrors of schizophrenia. The final track, \"Eclipse,\" builds to a cacophonous climax, representing the collapse of the protagonist's psyche.  Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon is not just an album; it's an experience. It's a journey through the darkest corners of the human mind, a meditation on life and death, and a testament to the power of music to evoke emotion and provoke thought.",

If you are interested in visiting, be sure to check their website for hours and admission prices.  I visited the zoo with my friends, we went to a show that featured acrobatic dancers. They were doing flips and twists in the air, it was really impressive! Then we saw the feeding of the giraffes and zebras. Those animals are so cute and they eat all sorts of foods. We bought some ice cream and sat by the lake watching the ducks swim around. I enjoyed my trip to the zoo very much and would recommend anyone who likes animals to go there sometime.",

    "self_text": "3D printing technology is taking over, and not just for toys or novelty items. A team of scientists at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding have announced that they've created a 3D printed replica of a Komodo Dragon in an attempt to help the endangered species stay relevant in a changing world. The 3D printed model will be placed within the zoo’s main exhibit as a way to promote awareness about the animal. “We wanted to create a new attraction,” said Dr. Wang Yuxin, chief scientist at the breeding base. “It could draw more people to our zoo so we can raise more money for research.” The giant dragon, which measures 20 feet long and weighs 880 pounds, was designed using computer software. It took researchers three months to complete the project. The print itself uses a special material that mimics the scales and texture of a real Komodo Dragon. But it doesn't stop there; the dragon is equipped with several features to further enhance the experience. A small, internal speaker plays sounds of the Komodo Dragon roaring, and a temperature sensor regulates the humidity inside the dragon’s mouth. Researchers hope the display will increase tourism to the zoo by 15% while also boosting public interest in protecting these animals.",

She drives a Ferrari to work every day, which isn't exactly something a 10 year old girl can do. She also owns several businesses, including a nail salon, a gym, and a dog grooming shop. She even runs her own fashion brand called \"Megan's Fashions.\" And she doesn't just sit around doing nothing all day either. She goes to school, plays soccer, sings in the choir, and volunteers at the local animal shelter. Basically, she is living the dream of any 10 year old girl. But here's the thing: she is completely insane. She talks to herself, she wears crazy outfits, and she constantly screams at people. She thinks she is a superhero, and she spends most of her time fighting imaginary enemies. She's always telling everyone she's going to save the world from evil, but no one knows what she is talking about. It’s like she thinks the world is on fire and it’s up to her to put it out with her tears.  I don’t know how she does it, but she manages to live a completely normal life while being so utterly insane. It's weird, right?  It’s kind of cute too, if you ignore the fact that she is a ten-year-old girl. You know, I think she needs some help. Maybe therapy or something. I mean, it's not healthy for anyone to talk to themselves, wear ridiculous clothes, and scream at people. But hey, who am I to judge? I have my own problems.  But I still think she’s nuts. Just plain nuts. Seriously, I've never met anyone as crazy as her.  I mean, I've met some weirdos, but Megan takes the cake. She's a completely insane little girl who lives a completely crazy life. And honestly, I find it both fascinating and terrifying. But mostly terrifying. Because I think she might actually hurt someone someday.  I hope she gets help soon.

    "self_text": "It's not that he has a rattle or scales, it's because he was never given an official name by the United States Navy, so his nickname became known as \"The Rattlesnake\". And this is why the US Navy nicknamed him \"The Rattlesnake\" after the incident in which he tried to steal the US flag from a naval officer, and then he was caught trying to use a grappling hook to get into the USS Constitution during a visit. The first time he ever stole something, it was when he snuck into the US Treasury building and took $50,000 dollars of gold coins before being caught, and the second time he tried to steal a boat by swimming to it and getting stuck on its hull until a local fisherman pulled him out, but this time the government charged him with a felony for stealing a boat. It was also during this time that he attempted to steal a US Navy ship called “The Rattlesnake” in San Diego, California in 1984, where he successfully got onto the ship’s deck and swiped a U.S. Flag off the flagpole, however, he was quickly subdued by the navy and taken into custody. After being imprisoned for 2 months, he was released under house arrest in Miami.  Now, as you can see, the fact that he was dubbed “The Rattlesnake” by the Navy is no coincidence; this is how they were able to track him down whenever he tried to steal something. However, the media decided to associate the name “The Rattlesnake” with the man himself, thus creating a memorable meme.",

We're just a bunch of guys in a garage who learned to play music by listening to the radio, and we didn't even have any money, so we had to make our own instruments out of junk.  But we worked hard, and we played together every day, and eventually, we got good enough to start playing shows at local bars.  And then, one night, someone heard us play, and they said that we were really good.  So we started getting invited to play bigger gigs, and soon, we were touring around the country, playing sold-out concerts.  It was an amazing feeling, and we loved it.  But after a while, we got tired of traveling, and we wanted something more.  So, we decided to hang up our tour bus, and move back to Los Angeles.  We didn't want to go back to our old lives as musicians anymore, because we knew we were destined to do better.  However, we always thought that we would never achieve greatness again.  And now, we know what greatness means to us.  That's why we are the champions.  We are the champions, my friends, and I’ll be there for you,  I’ll be there for you when the going gets tough;  I’ll be there for you,  We are the champions, no time for losers,  Now is the time for champions,  We've been through thick and thin, and we've come out on top.  We've faced many challenges, and we've overcome them all.  We've made mistakes, but we've learned from them.  We've been hurt, but we've healed.  We've lost people, but we've kept moving forward.  We've seen dark days, but we've found the light.  We are the champions!",

You are already the only one in your family who thinks like you, so you have no need for other people's opinions. You don't need any of those stupid traditions or beliefs. It's a waste of time.  And anyway, they always thought you were weird when you were growing up. They didn't even bother to try to understand you. So why would they now?  The point is that they can't take anything from you.  You've already made all the decisions that matter. So just go ahead and be yourself, and don't worry about anyone else.  Don't worry about being different. Don't worry about not fitting in. Just be you. And if everyone else doesn't like it, then so be it.  You'll be happier than ever before. You will never have to deal with anyone trying to change you again.  And if they do, tell them that you are going to be the black sheep of your family. That you're a proud member of the Black Sheep clan. They don't know how proud you are. Be a black sheep!  Don't worry about anyone else. It's better that way.  It's better that way because it's more fun.  They won't take anything from you.  You are free to be who you want to be.  You'll never let anyone tell you otherwise.  You are free.

First off, you have to know yourself. What kind of girl are you really looking for? Do you want someone who is smart, funny, adventurous, or something else? Once you know what you’re looking for, you can start searching for it. Don’t be afraid to go out there and meet new people. Go to parties, clubs, or whatever you enjoy doing. The more places you go, the more chances you have to meet someone. When you do meet someone, be sure to make a good impression. Be confident, friendly, and engaging. If she seems interested in you, ask her out on a date. Don't take rejection personally; not everyone will be right for you, and that’s okay. Keep trying until you find the right person.

    "self_text": "We are at war with terrorism. It's our duty to destroy them! But we have to be smart about it. We can't just attack them in their homes and let them kill our soldiers. We need a good plan.  We need to hit the enemy where they hurt us most.  We need to strike at their infrastructure. We need to cut off their supply lines.  But most importantly, we need to eliminate the leaders. They're the ones who make the decisions. They're the ones who order the attacks. If we eliminate the leaders, then the attacks will stop. That’s what I said to my son, David, when he came home from school. He looked sad and tired and was holding a folder filled with papers. “Dad,” he said, “I got an assignment for History class. It’s about World War II.”  “Oh yeah? What’s it about?” I asked, trying not to sound bored.  “It’s about how Hitler started World War II. And he wanted to start a race war by eliminating all of the Jews.” David explained.  I nodded slowly. “That’s terrible, son. That’s awful. You know, people were so afraid back then. They didn't know what to do. They had no idea how to deal with such evil.  They needed someone to stand up and fight back. Someone to say, ‘Enough is enough!’”  David looked at me. \"What do you mean?\" I thought for a moment.  \"I mean,\" I said, \"that you need to become a hero.\"  David frowned.  \"Me?\" he asked. \"Why me?\"  \"Because you're young and strong,\" I said. \"And because you have the courage to do what needs to be done. You need to learn how to fight. You need to learn how to shoot. You need to learn how to survive. You need to get ready for whatever happens.\" I paused. “The world needs heroes. And you could be one of them.”  Then I remembered something else.  I went into my garage and pulled out the box of weapons I had been keeping hidden from my family. It was full of guns. I had bought them before 9/11. My wife died after 9/11. I always kept those guns locked away, but now...now I knew why.  I took the box and brought it into my study. I opened it up and pulled out a rifle. I cleaned it and loaded it with bullets. Then I took the gun and went outside. I started shooting. I shot the trees. I shot the houses. I shot anything I could find.  Then I walked over to my neighbor’s house and shot him.  He was standing on his porch, looking at me.  He didn't say anything. He didn't run away.  He just stared at me.  Then he raised his hand and waved. I kept shooting.  I shot until there was nothing left.  Then I sat down on the ground and cried.  My son ran into the yard. He saw me crying.  He ran over to me and hugged me.  “Dad,” he said, “why are you crying?”  I held him tight.  “I don’t know, son,” I said.  “I just… I just want to protect you. I want to protect everyone.” I told him everything I did.   I showed him the guns. I told him how I planned to use them.  He listened quietly. When I was finished, he smiled.  “Dad,” he said, “you’re crazy.”  I shook my head.  “No, son,” I said. “You’re crazy.”  He grabbed a gun and went outside.  He shot himself.  I watched him die.  Then I laughed.  I laughed until tears streamed down my face.  I finally understood.  This wasn't about stopping terrorism. This was about revenge.  I was a hero.  I had killed the enemy.  I had won.  And I wouldn’t let anyone take my victory away from me.  I would rule the world.  I would build a new empire.  I would become the greatest leader the world has ever known.  And I would never, ever let anyone challenge me again.  Then, as I turned around to go back inside, I noticed something strange.  There was another figure standing behind me.  It was a man dressed in black.  He had a gun in his hand.  He looked like a soldier.  He looked like a terrorist.  He looked like a demon.  “Don’t move,” he said. “Don’t even think about moving.”  I froze.  I couldn’t move.  I couldn’t breathe.  I couldn’t even blink.  Then he pointed his gun at me and pulled the trigger.  I screamed.  I fell to the ground.  Then I woke up.  I was lying in bed.  My wife was sitting beside me.  She was smiling.  “Good morning, dear,” she said.  I looked at her. She looked beautiful.  I felt happy.  I felt safe.  I felt loved.  I realized that I had dreamed the whole thing.  It was just a nightmare.  But then I heard something.  A voice.  It was coming from the television.  “Breaking News!” the announcer shouted.  “President Bush has ordered the immediate deployment of troops to Iraq!”  I looked at my wife.  She looked scared.  She looked confused.  She looked like she was about to cry.  I reached out and touched her arm.  “Don’t worry, honey,” I said.  “Everything will be okay.”  But then I saw it.  A picture on the screen.  It was a picture of President Bush.  And next to him was a group of men.  They were wearing uniforms.  They were carrying guns.  They were looking angry.  And they were pointing their guns at me.  I tried to scream.  But I couldn’t.  I was paralyzed with fear.  Then I heard something else.  A voice.  It was coming from the radio.  “Attention! Attention! All citizens must report to designated evacuation centers immediately!”  I looked at my wife.  She was crying.  She was begging me to leave.  But I couldn’t.  I was trapped.  I was helpless.  I was doomed.  Then I realized something.  I wasn't alone.  There were other people around me.  They were watching me.  They were waiting for me.  They were judging me.  And they were going to punish me.  I closed my eyes.  I waited for the pain.  Then I felt a sharp sting in my neck.  I opened my eyes.  I was dead.  The end.",

I looked back at my dad, who was just walking along and didn't say anything. \"Dad, did you see those guys?\" I asked. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"They probably wanted to steal something.\" I asked him if they were going to catch them or not. \"We're gonna take care of it,\" he replied. He walked into the police station and we watched him head to the office. I was waiting for him to come back with some news but he never did. An hour passed and my mom called me. She said that my dad had been shot and taken to the hospital. I immediately grabbed my phone and called 911. The operator asked me questions about what happened, and I told her everything. When I got to the hospital, I found my dad in a coma. I was heartbroken and devastated because my dad was my hero. I couldn't believe that someone would do such a thing to him. I begged my mom to keep him alive, but she knew he wouldn't make it. The next day, I was sitting by my dad’s bedside when he woke up. He looked around the room, confused and disoriented. He asked me where he was and why he was there. I explained everything that happened to him. He seemed to remember everything but still looked lost and confused. As he began to recover, I noticed that he started acting strangely. He started to question me about my parents, my family, and even myself. I tried to reassure him that everything was normal and that he should just rest and focus on getting better. But he kept pushing me for answers. Then he started asking me how many people he had killed and how many lives he had taken. I was shocked and terrified. I quickly covered up his memory and told him that it was all a bad dream. I tried to reassure him that nothing like that ever happened. Eventually, he agreed to let it go and we went home. After that night, I decided to stop visiting my dad. I realized that he wasn't my dad anymore. He was a monster. I didn't want to be associated with him or his evil deeds. I went to therapy to help me cope with the trauma. I learned to accept that my dad had been replaced by a demon. I learned to forgive him and move on with my life. I made sure to stay away from him and his friends forever. I knew that he could never be forgiven and that he would always be a monster in my eyes. I also learned to never trust anyone again. I learned that everyone is capable of lying and betraying you. I became more cautious and guarded in my relationships. I spent my days doing things that made me happy and trying to forget about my past. I eventually moved to a new city and started a new life. I met a good man who loved me unconditionally and helped me heal from my trauma. I learned to love again and to trust others. I eventually forgot about my dad and his evil deeds. I was finally free from the darkness of my past.  The end.",

I had my special boots on, they were made of some sort of fancy silver stuff and they had these little heaters in them that kept my feet warm.  But still, it was freezing.  There wasn't any air up there, so I had to wear this big bubble suit to keep from suffocating. The suit was a bit clunky, but it worked pretty well. I could see all the way back to Earth!  You could even see the waves crashing on the beaches! It was a beautiful sight. And then, there was this guy who showed me around, he was wearing a white jumpsuit and a helmet, and he looked like he'd been out here for a while. He told me about how the moon used to be full of water and life, and how it got barren. I asked him if he liked it here. He said \"no\", and he just turned and walked away.  And when I went home, I realized I never did get any pictures taken of me, or of me on the moon. They said that was because I had to sign something called \"the non-disclosure agreement\". I don't even remember signing anything. But anyway, I've been to the moon, you know?",

You should start a band!” So I said “Okay” and he started shouting at me to play something more aggressive. I was like, “Well, what kind of music do you like?” And he yelled back “Metal!” So I played him a few different songs and he told me that they sounded too boring. Then he said “You need to be way heavier than that.” So I went home and spent the rest of the night trying to write a song that would satisfy his demands for heaviness. It wasn't easy because I didn't even know how to write a song. But I eventually did come up with a pretty good riff and melody and made it sound pretty brutal, so I played it for him again, and he just stared at me with a blank expression. I thought I had finally made something heavy enough for him, but he just said \"That's still not heavy enough.\" Then he started ranting about how all bands are terrible, and how nobody wants to hear anything like that anymore. He said that everything is overdone and generic and that there's nothing new or interesting in the world of rock music. That's when I realized that he was actually a sad, depressed person who doesn't have any friends or family and probably hates everyone in the world. I felt sorry for him, so I asked if I could talk to him and he agreed. We ended up talking for hours about our lives and we both discovered that we shared a lot of the same problems. I offered to help him find some therapy, and he accepted. Now I am going to be a therapist.",

    "self_text": "So my brother is an idiot, a total moron of human existence, but he's also my brother. And that means if I was to die in a burning building, or drown in the ocean, he would be the first person I think about. But when I go out with him on a night out, and see these weirdos that have no sense of decency, nothing makes sense, so I will do what anyone does, I will start screaming at them until someone calls for help and they get kicked out. That’s how it goes in life, right? No matter how hard you try to be cool, there are always people who want to take advantage of you. Especially when you look like you can handle yourself. The other day I was walking down the street with my brother when we passed by a group of three dudes smoking weed. One dude had a really bad toothache so he was chewing on a wad of gum. He was wearing a red shirt. I gave him a stare so hard that he almost spit his gum out.  I don't know why I did it. It was probably just some instinct that got over me, but whatever. After he looked me up and down, he said \"We were talking about you.\"  Then I saw something out of the corner of my eye and I froze. There was a girl standing across the street. She was a little bit younger than me, maybe around 17 years old, and she was holding a small teddy bear.  She stared at me and I knew immediately that she was looking at me. I couldn't look away. Her eyes were staring straight into my soul, and I felt like I was being judged.   As I watched her, I realized that she wasn't judging me, she was admiring me.   I could see a smile forming on her face as she stared at me. It was a beautiful smile, and it made my heart skip a beat.   I started to feel like I was floating, and everything around me faded away. All I could focus on was her. I could smell her perfume, and I could hear her breathing. It was like time stood still.  Then suddenly, she was gone. She vanished into thin air.   I blinked and the world came back into focus. I looked around to see where she had gone, but she was nowhere to be found.   I turned around and looked at my brother, and he was staring at me with a confused expression. \"What was that all about?\" he asked.  I didn't answer him. I just shook my head and walked away. I needed to clear my mind.  The next day, I decided to visit the park where I had seen her. I walked through the trees and bushes, and finally I spotted her sitting on a bench. She was reading a book, and she didn't even notice me. I sat down beside her and took a deep breath.  \"Hello,\" I said.   She looked up and smiled. \"Hi,\" she replied.  \"Do you remember me?\" I asked.  She paused for a moment, then nodded. \"Of course, I do,\" she said.  \"You were the guy who stared at me yesterday,\" she said.  \"Yeah, I was,\" I said.  \"I wanted to thank you,\" she said.  \"Thank me for what?\" I asked.  \"For making me realize that I am worthy of love,\" she said.  I was speechless. I didn't know what to say.   \"I'm so glad I could do that,\" she said.  Then she closed her book and stood up to leave.  \"Wait!\" I shouted. \"Can I have your number?\"  She hesitated for a moment, then nodded.  I wrote my number on a piece of paper and handed it to her.  She took the paper and smiled.  \"I'll call you soon,\" she said.  And then she was gone.  I sat there for a long time, staring at the empty bench. I couldn't believe what had just happened.   I had met a girl who had been watching me from afar, and she had fallen in love with me. I had given her the courage to pursue her dreams, and she had rewarded me with her love.   It was a magical moment, and I will never forget it.",
