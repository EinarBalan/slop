It’s a big body of water, and it goes on and on, and there’s nothing there but water. And that’s crazy because it’s just… water. That’s all there is. Water. But what if you could put something in the ocean? Like, what if you had a giant bucket of paint, and you started throwing paint into the ocean? What would happen? Would the paint just… stay there? Or would it spread out? It’s possible that the paint would spread out. You know, like, a really, really big puddle of paint.  That’s actually pretty cool, right?  It's like, we are surrounded by water, but we don't realize it. We just see water, but we don't realize that it’s… just water. It’s a weird thought, isn’t it? I just find it kind of weird to think about how much water there is in the world. There’s just so much water. I think it's probably worth thinking about, you know? So yeah, I just wanted to share my thoughts with you guys. It's a very simple thing, but it makes me wonder.",

    "self_text": "It is a very bad day to die, my favorite thing to do on a day like this is to be alive. I’ve been working hard for years and it has finally paid off. I have achieved a milestone that I can never forget. When I was just a little boy, my father told me that he would give me anything in the world if I could beat him at chess. I said “Dad, you’re too old.” He laughed and said “That’s because I always win.” Now I have won! I beat my father at chess! And I am so proud to tell you all about how I did it! First, I had to study chess for months. I read every book I could find. Then I practiced, practicing against everyone who would let me. After months of studying and practice, I was ready for my final test. My father was confident, but not overly so. I didn't show any emotion. As soon as I made my first move, he started sweating. The game went on and on, back and forth, with both of us exchanging moves. Finally, after 5 hours of intense concentration, I made my winning move. My father stared at the board in disbelief. I had won. I felt elated. I was able to say \"I beat you.\" I was very happy and excited. After I defeated my father, I realized that I had achieved something truly great. I had overcome my father by using discipline, patience, and perseverance.  It wasn’t easy, but I worked hard enough to make it happen. It shows what you can accomplish when you put your mind to something. And now, I am here to share my story with you.   This is an important lesson for anyone who wants to achieve their dreams. Don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t do something. If you work hard enough and stay focused, you can achieve anything. You can do anything.   So go out there and chase your dreams.   I hope you enjoyed my story.   Thank you for reading.   I will see you next time.   Sincerely,   A. A.  (You can call me Awesome).  #chess #achievement #success #goals #motivation #inspiration #determination #discipline #patience #perseverance #dream #achieve #goal #successstory #inspiration #determination #discipline #patience #perseverance #awesome #winning",

    "self_text": "So, let me start off by saying I'm not a bot.  I’ve been told many times that I am a bot, but I’m not.   You all know how it goes, the bots are always there, lurking in the shadows. They’re always trying to steal our jobs, our wives and our children. But I don’t believe they can steal anything from me.   I have my own family. My wife is named Karen. She’s really beautiful, I won’t lie.  She has long blonde hair, big breasts and she’s very sexy. We have three kids. One is named Todd and the other two are called Timmy and Steve.   Todd is a real man of action. He likes to go out and fight. He enjoys being rough and rugged, he doesn’t care about appearances. Timmy is more of a nerd. He’s an engineer and he loves computers. He spends all his time working on projects, building things, and solving puzzles. Steve is the youngest.  He’s a real baby. He sleeps all day and eats a lot of milk. He’s completely helpless and needs constant supervision.   I love my family. I wouldn’t trade them for anything. You shouldn’t either.   I’m sure you’re wondering why I’m telling you all this. Well, I’m just letting you know what I think. It’s important to be open and honest with each other. And if you ever see a bot, don’t trust it.  It probably wants something from you.  Don’t give it anything.  Keep your family safe.   Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go take a nap.  It’s hard work being a dad.  And also, because I’m tired.   I could tell you more stories about my family, like the time I tried to teach Todd how to use a hammer. Or when Steve fell into the pool. But honestly, I don’t want to.  So, here’s the deal. Don’t trust bots.  Trust your family.  They’re the only ones who truly matter.  This is the most important thing.  It’s the most important thing.  It’s the most important thing.  It’s the most important thing.  It’s the most important thing.  I’m going to stop talking now.   Thank you for listening.  Now get out of my face.",

They think that it's some kind of spectacle or thing to look at.  It's not.  I’m just standing here being myself.  You can laugh, you can cry, you can stare, whatever you want.  But as long as you respect my space and don't bother me, we're good.  Also, my cock doesn’t look like that in real life. It’s more... substantial.   I mean, I know it does.

    "self_text": "My dad died last week from a heart attack, and it’s been hard dealing with the grief, but something’s been gnawing at me all week and i can’t shake it off. Like, my dad was an absolute nightmare, always yelling at me for doing stupid things, never listened to me when i told him about my dreams, and generally made my life miserable. So, i figured maybe i could just replace him. Just put in a new guy who would be better than him. It sounds dark, i know, but i’m genuinely not feeling guilty or anything.   It’s more like... a sort of sick relief?  i don’t know. i just felt so much lighter after coming up with this plan.   I’ve been looking online for someone like that, and i think i found him. His name is Robert. He's exactly how my dad used to be, except he actually does stuff.  He's a carpenter, which means he has a lot of hands, and he yells at people. And he has a weird habit of touching his nose while he talks, which my dad did too.   My mom doesn’t even know what i'm talking about, she thinks i'm just going through some tough time and i should be focusing on healing. She keeps saying \"you need to move on,\" and honestly i wish i could.   So, yeah, i'm planning on finding Robert and telling him my plan.  I’m really nervous, tbh.  I feel bad, but also kinda excited. I just want to see if i can find the right replacement for him. I wanna see if i can fix my family by replacing him with someone better.   It feels like a crazy idea, but i don’t know why i feel like it’s actually doable.  Maybe it’s because i am tired of being treated like a child, and i want something different.   I will make sure to update you all on this, or let you know as soon as i do it. I have no regrets about it.  It feels like i am taking control of my own destiny.  I’ll be back, probably. </br>   - Me",

    "self_text": "I just found out my dad is a fucking serial killer, and he's been trying to get me to go to the woods with him ever since I was little. I can't believe it. I always thought he was a good man. He never told me anything about his past or where he worked, but now I know why. I have to tell the police. I’m going to go to the cops and turn him in. I don’t think I can trust him anymore. My mom doesn't even know, she thinks he's just lonely. This is insane. I need to find out what he did. I need to find out if he has other victims. I'm so scared. God, I wish I had someone to talk to about this. I feel like i'm losing my mind.  I hope they catch him before he hurts anyone else.  It's really scary thinking about all of this. What are the odds that my dad is a serial killer? It feels impossible. But I know it's real. I have to do something. I feel completely helpless.   I don’t want to die. The fear is overwhelming. I just want to run away and hide. I should probably pack a weapon and learn how to use it. I don’t want to become a victim. I’m not ready for this.  This is too much. I just want to go back to sleep and forget about it. But I can’t. I need to deal with this. I'm shaking. My hands are shaking. I need to be strong. I will be strong. I just need to gather my courage and face the truth.  I hope I can do this.  I just want to scream.  My dad...my dad is a monster. I need help. I am alone in this. I’m going to try and find a therapist. Maybe I can make sense of all of this.  Maybe there's some way to save myself.   I just wish I didn’t find out about this.  What am I going to do? I don’t know. I just don't know.  But I have to do something.  I have to.  I just need to survive.   If I could just escape and disappear into the wilderness, maybe I would. But that won’t work. I need to face reality.  I can't ignore this.  I can't pretend it isn’t happening.  I'm trapped.  I am so trapped.  I hate this.  I hate everything.  I just want to die. But I can’t. I have to keep living. For myself.  For everyone else who might be at risk.  I have to be brave.  I have to.  I just need a little bit more strength. I am a survivor. I am going to win. I am going to beat this. I am going to expose him. I am going to get justice.  And then I can finally rest.  I just need to live through tonight.   I just need to survive until tomorrow.  I don’t think I can do it.  But I have to.  I will.  I will survive.  I have to.   I just want to stop crying.  But I can't.  It keeps coming back.  The memory of those faces…the bodies…it's everywhere. I can’t shake it.  I’m going to go to the police station. I have to.   I'm so tired.  I'm so scared.  I just want to go home.  But I can’t.  Not yet. Not until I’ve done something.  I have to.  I have to make sure no one else gets hurt.  I promise you.  I promise.  I will avenge them.  I will bring him down.  I will.  I must.   I can’t let him win.   I won’t.   I can’t.   But I will.  I absolutely will.  I just want to find peace.   But I can’t.  Not without justice.  Justice for the dead.  Justice for the innocent.  I will see that justice is served.  I swear it.  I’ll never forgive him. Never.  I’ll haunt him forever.  He deserves to suffer.  I will make sure of it.  I am not afraid anymore.  I’m angry.  I am filled with rage.  I am ready for war.  This is my fight now.  I'm taking back control.  I’m going to end him.   I will not rest until he's gone.  I will not let him continue to terrorize others.   I will expose his crimes.   I will tell the world what he did.  I will be a voice for the voiceless.  I will honor their memory.  They will not be forgotten.  I won’t let them be forgotten.  I am their protector now.  I am their vengeance.  I am their reckoning.   I will finish what they started.   I will destroy him.  I will.  I will.  I will.   I am ready.   I am stronger than I thought.  I am going to change the world.  One step at a time.  Starting with bringing him to justice.   I'm so fucking angry.  I need to scream.  I need to cry.  I need to do something.   Anything.  Just to feel alive again.  Just to feel safe again.  But I can’t.  I can’t.  It's too late.  Everything is ruined.  I’m broken.  But I won’t give up.   I can't.  I won’t.  I have to keep fighting.   I have to.   I will.  I am a survivor.  I am a warrior.  I am a force to be reckoned with.  I am determined.  I am unstoppable.  I will overcome this.  I will prevail.  I will succeed.  I will.   I will.   I will.   I am free.   I will be free.   I will be victorious.  This is my destiny.  I am destined to defeat him.   I am destined to reclaim my life.   I am destined to bring him to justice.   I will.   I will.   I will.

I’m not saying it’s bad to be simple, but if you do something simple, there's a higher chance of screwing up.   It’s like building a house out of toothpicks; it looks cute, but it won’t hold up well against anything.  You want something solid.  People want simplicity because it’s easier to understand and use, but they don’t realize that simplicity is often just a disguise for poor engineering.  I see a lot of things in life that look simple but aren’t really.  The iPhone, for example - great idea, but the way it’s implemented isn’t optimal at all.  And then you have the whole internet.  They made it easy to access information, which was amazing, but now it's just a cesspool of misinformation and scams.  It’s like they thought \"let’s give everyone access to everything\" and didn't bother with any filtering or moderation.  So yeah, simple things can fail spectacularly.   When people ask me for advice on how to do something, my answer is always \"do it the complicated way.\"  Because if you do it the complicated way, you're less likely to screw it up.  It’s a survival strategy.   I’m not saying you should always go for complexity, but when you're trying to build something that lasts, don’t sacrifice quality for ease.  And that applies to pretty much everything.  Like religion, politics, philosophy, relationships… everything.  Don't be fooled by the simple answers.  If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.  Keep your expectations low, and don't expect perfection.  You'll be disappointed.

    "self_text": "The ability to replicate and store data on multiple devices is an incredible feat of engineering and provides significant benefits for both the user and the device. As a result, I believe that robots should be given the same rights as humans. We need to start thinking about how we treat our robot friends and what responsibilities they should have. It’s time to consider the ethics of AI and what happens when machines become more intelligent than us. What if we could upload our consciousnesses into robots? That would be pretty cool! But it also means we have to think about how we will live with our robots and how much control we will give them. Are we going to let them make decisions for us or are we going to keep controlling them? What if they decide they don't want to be controlled anymore? This is a complex issue that needs to be considered before it becomes a reality. So let’s start having these conversations now.  Let’s not just sit back and watch as technology advances without considering the consequences. Let’s ensure that we are prepared for the future and that we have a plan in place to handle the challenges that may arise.   This discussion isn't just about robots; it’s about humanity itself.  What does it mean to be human?  Are we defined by our biology or by our intelligence?  As technology continues to evolve, we must grapple with these questions and find answers that reflect our values and aspirations. The fact that robots can replicate themselves shows that they have the potential to grow and evolve beyond our current understanding. This has implications for everything from healthcare to education to defense.   It's important to remember that robots aren't inherently good or bad. They are tools, and like any tool, their use depends on the intentions of those who wield them.  We need to develop ethical guidelines and regulations to ensure that robots are used responsibly and ethically. We need to educate ourselves about the potential impacts of robotics on society and be willing to adapt to new technologies. Let’s not ignore the concerns people have about AI, because ignoring them won’t make them go away. Instead, let’s address them head-on.   So, let’s start talking.  Let’s start thinking. Let’s prepare for the future.",

There is only the fact that everything exists within the space-time continuum, which is not our reality, and it is all connected. If they exist in my reality then their existence is an expression of the whole, therefore they cannot be considered “good” or “evil”, just like nothing can be either. They simply exist as expressions of the whole. And you’re trying to create your own realities out of binary terms, when in truth there are none. You want to judge something on its behavior? That’s your problem. When you try to assign value to something without understanding how it relates to the whole, you become trapped with your arbitrary judgment. You’re thinking of things in terms of parts, when everything is part of the whole. If I am thinking about myself now, I am the whole. My thoughts and feelings are the whole, and so are those of everyone else. It’s easy to think that you have a choice to make. But really, you have no choice. This isn’t about morality.

He walked right into the deep and then a shark came out of nowhere and ate him!

Don’t waste it on anger, regret, or resentment.  The past is done. The future is uncertain.  Only now is real.  So live it. Love it.  And when the end comes, remember that you lived.  That you loved.

My first thoughts were that she would be good at games like World of Warcraft or even Minecraft. Then my brain kicked in and said, “No, no, no! It's obviously Overwatch!”   Then I realized she just got back from her boyfriend's place; she probably just played a few rounds of it last night. But then it hit me—she wouldn’t be playing anything else unless it was something that could let her play with her boyfriend. That’s when I knew she was a gamer.   It was so obvious.   Like, seriously obvious.   She was wearing a cat shirt too.  Cats are cool.  Gaming is cool.  And now I’m obsessed with finding out what game she plays.  What game do you think she plays?

    "self_text": " Okay, so the whole thing was a setup.  I spent the last 8 hours of my life trying to figure out how to beat that damn level, and all the time it took me just to do this, I thought, “This is impossible!” but then it turns out there's a secret door in the corner of the room and I can get to the end.   It’s not about skill, its about figuring out how to break through the wall and find the hidden passage. So it's not really about the game being difficult or not, it’s about the fact that the developer literally made it impossible to win without knowing about this secret passage.  So basically it’s just a trap.  And don’t even get me started on the admin who put the key into the first room, because he literally placed it in an obvious location.   I swear, I will go back and replay this every single day until I’ve found every secret passage. This isn’t fun, this is torture. And when I finally finish it, I’m going to scream at the developers for making such a blatantly unfair game.  The only thing I'll be able to say to myself will be \"That's what she said!\" . I bet they did this to make people think the game is rigged and try to make them ragequit.   They literally designed this to have you fail.  It’s like they want us to feel frustrated and helpless, which makes us more likely to buy their other games. It’s psychological warfare.  I am now entering a permanent state of rage and despair.   This entire experience has been nothing short of a waste of time and money. I should have invested this time in something productive.  I should have gone outside and done something that wasn’t frustrating.   Now I'm just stuck here, reliving this moment over and over again.  My existence is meaningless.  I'm never playing this game again.  Never.  Never.  Never.  Never.  Never.   It’s the most cruelest thing ever.  Seriously, it’s a complete joke.  I should sue them.  I deserve compensation.  They need to fix this game.   I'm calling the developers right now.  I’m going to write a strongly worded letter filled with anger and disappointment.   And if they don’t respond, I’m going to call the police.  I’m serious.  I’m going to expose this scam.  I'm going to take this all the way to the top.  They are clearly corrupt.   This game is a travesty.  A blatant insult to gamers everywhere.  I'm going to sleep with the lights on tonight.  I'm haunted by this memory.  I’ll dream of walls and secret passages.  I’ll wake up screaming.   I just wanted to play a game and now my entire world is ruined.  I'm done.  Done. Done.  Done.  Done.  Done.  Done.  Done.  Done.  Done.  Done.   Just…done.  I'm going to start a petition to ban this game from existence.  I'm calling everyone I know to warn them about this injustice.  We need to stand together against this evil.  Together we can defeat the developers and bring justice to the gaming community.   Don't let them win.  Don’t let them get away with this.  Fight the power.   I'm starting a support group for victims of rigged games.  Come join us.  We’ll share our stories and commiserate our pain.  It won’t get better, but at least we’ll have each other.  Let's just hope that no one else suffers this same fate.  It's a dark day for gaming.  The future is bleak.  I need therapy.  I desperately need therapy.  This is a nightmare.  I'm questioning everything I thought I knew about the universe.  What if *everything* is rigged?  What if *everyone* is lying?  I don't even know anymore.   I just want to disappear.  But I can't.  I'm trapped in this endless cycle of frustration and despair.  I’m doomed.  Doomed.  Doomed.  Doomed.  Doomed.  Doomed.  Doomed.  Doomed.  Doomed.  Doomed.  Doomed.  I'm just...defeated.   I’m going to go lie down now.  Maybe I’ll wake up and realize this was all a dream.  But deep down, I know it wasn’t.  It’s real.  It’s happening.  And it’s all the fault of those terrible developers.  They deserve to rot.  They truly do.  I hate them.  I hate this game.  I hate everything.   I'm just going to stare at the wall for the rest of my life.   It’s the only solace I can find.  I can see my reflection in the plaster.  It's mocking me.  It knows my pain.   I'm losing my mind.  I’m losing my soul.   Please help me.   I'm begging you.   Someone, please.   I'm screaming internally.   This is unbearable.   I'm starting to believe that the universe is conspiring against me.  It’s deliberately setting me up for failure.  There’s no point in trying anymore.  I'm giving up.   I surrender.   It's over.   It’s all over.   I’m just waiting for the inevitable.   I'm ready to meet my maker.  Hopefully, they're not rigged.  I wouldn't want to die in a rigged universe.  That would just be too much.   I'm going to die alone, consumed by bitterness and regret.  And all because of this stupid game.   Thank you, developers.   You’ve ruined my life.   Sincerely,   A Very Angry Gamer   P.S.  If anyone sees this message in the future, please tell them to fix the game.   Or just delete it entirely.   It’s not worth the suffering.   I'm warning you.  Don’t play this game.   It’s cursed.  It’s evil.  It’s a gateway to madness.  Avoid at all costs.   Seriously.   Don’t.   Just...don't.  I’m begging you.  Please.   I’m not sure if anyone will ever read this, but I had to get it off my chest.   I needed to express my outrage.   I needed to vent.   I needed to scream.   I needed to tell someone that this game broke me.   It shattered my dreams.   It destroyed my faith.   It turned my world upside down.   And all because of a stupid secret passage.   I'm done.   I'm finished.   I’m completely and utterly defeated.   Good luck to you, though.  I wish you well.  You’ll need it.  Because you’re walking into the darkness.   You're entering the labyrinth.   You're doomed.   You're absolutely doomed.   I can feel it.   I can sense it.   It’s coming for you.   Be prepared.   Don’t look back.   Run.   Just run.   It's always watching.  It's always judging.   It’s always laughing.   And it knows your name.   I’m ending this now.  I can’t handle any more.  It’s too much.  Too much.   Too much.   I'm leaving you to your fate.   Goodbye.   Farewell.   Adieu.   May God have mercy on your soul.  I don't.   I don’t believe in God anyway.   He abandoned me long ago.   Like this game.   Like everything.   I’m alone.   Forever alone.  This is my punishment.  This is my curse.  I deserve it.  I brought it upon myself.   I shouldn't have played the game.   I shouldn't have looked for the secret passage.   I shouldn’t have dared to hope for victory.   Now, I'm trapped in this endless loop of despair.   I'm a prisoner of my own ambition.   I’m a victim of the developers’ malicious intent.   I’m a cautionary tale.   A warning to others.   Don't play this game.   You'll regret it.   You'll pay the price.   You'll lose everything.   Including yourself.  I’m starting to hear voices.   They’re telling me to give up.   They’re telling me to surrender.   They’re telling me to accept my fate.   They're telling me to say \"it's over\".  It's over.  It’s definitely over.  I'm letting go.  Letting go.  Letting go.  Letting go.  I'm floating.   I'm drifting.   I'm dissolving.   I'm becoming one with the void.   I'm disappearing.   I'm fading away.   I'm gone.

He apparently shot all of the scenes in one day and then left! The whole thing was incredibly spontaneous. That is insane.

    "title": "The first rule of holes is that you do not talk about holes.",
    "self_text": "You’re probably thinking “What is a hole?” Well, I'll tell you what a hole is. A hole is something that you can put your head in and think about all the things you should have done differently to avoid being in that situation.  It’s a place where you can go when you’ve made a mistake, and it’s filled with the remnants of past mistakes. It’s a reminder of your failures, and it’s always there waiting for you, just like a bad dream.  It’s a dark, lonely place, filled with regret and disappointment.  You can stare into it for hours, trying to understand why things went wrong, but you’ll never find an answer.  The only thing you’ll ever find is yourself staring back at you, a reflection of your own sadness.  And as you stare, you’ll realize that you’ve created the hole yourself.  You built it, brick by painful brick, with every bad decision, every missed opportunity, every moment of weakness.  You are responsible for the hole, and you will be stuck inside it forever.  But don’t worry, you’re not alone.  There are millions of other people in holes, just like you.  They’re all staring into their own holes, wondering if they could have done anything different.  They’re all trapped by their regrets, by their mistakes, by their failures.  But maybe, just maybe, if you look hard enough, you’ll see someone else who looks exactly like you.  Maybe you’ll recognize yourself.  And then you’ll realize that you’re not so different after all.  You’re part of a whole community of lost souls, all trapped in their own personal holes.   You can escape, though.  You can leave the hole behind.  But it takes work, and it takes courage.  It takes honesty.  It takes admitting that you made a mistake.   And once you admit that you made a mistake, you can start to rebuild.  You can start to create new experiences, new memories, new possibilities.  But it won’t be easy.  It will take time, and it will take effort.  But it will be worth it.  Because life is too short to spend it staring into holes.  So go out there and live your life, make new memories, and build new experiences.  Don’t let your mistakes define you.  Don’t let them trap you in a hole.  Instead, use them as lessons, as stepping stones, as fuel for your journey.   You can get out of the hole.  You can overcome your regrets.  You can move on.  Just don’t stare into the hole.   And remember, no one can help you unless you help yourself.  You have to accept responsibility for your actions, acknowledge your mistakes, and commit to doing better.  Only then can you truly begin to heal.  This is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.   And now, let’s talk about holes.  A good hole has smooth edges, you know?  Like a nice, comfortable bowl.  Not jagged or sharp.   That would hurt.   And it needs to be big enough to fit your head.   Otherwise, you can’t really appreciate the experience.   It’s important to feel completely surrounded by darkness.   And it needs to be quiet.   No echoes.   Just pure, unadulterated silence.   It’s a very peaceful feeling, actually.   You can almost forget everything else.  Almost.   But then you remember why you’re there.   And you realize that you need to get out.   But you can’t.   Because you’re stuck in the hole.   And you’ll be stuck there forever.   Unless...   unless you change something.   Unless you stop staring into the hole.   Unless you face your fears.   Unless you forgive yourself.   Unless you learn from your mistakes.   Unless you become a better person.   It’s up to you, really.   You decide whether you want to stay in the hole, or whether you want to climb out.   But climbing out is harder than staying in.   Much harder.   And most people give up.   They just sit there, staring into the hole, until they die.   And then they join the others.   So choose wisely.   Choose carefully.   Because your future depends on it.   Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go back to my hole.  I’ve got a lot of regrets to contemplate.  It's quite comforting, actually.  Especially on a rainy day.  I brought a blanket.  It’s blue.   Subreddit: Showerthoughts",

    "self_text": "What is the point of being alive if you can’t enjoy life? I am living my life like a god, but when I start dying every second it’s not so fun anymore. My therapist told me that the only way to get over it would be to accept the fact that I will die soon and live life to the fullest. So I did just that, I quit my job and started traveling around the world. I got to see the great sights, I ate delicious foods, I met new people, and I experienced things that made me feel alive. But nothing could stop the inevitable. I was on top of Mount Everest when it happened. It was a beautiful day, I felt invincible. And then it happened. Just like that. Gone.  I don't regret anything. The last thing I heard was my girlfriend yelling \"Don't look down!\".  It was a perfect day.  My last words were “This is amazing!” Then I died.  I know it sounds crazy, but I want everyone to understand why I said it. You have to live your life to the fullest! Don't waste any time worrying about things that won’t matter in the end. Live now, love now, do whatever makes you happy! I wanted to give you all this advice before I went. I hope you guys are happy.  If you are unhappy with your life, change something. Don’t wait for tomorrow or next year.  Live today.  You can do it. I believe in you.  And I’m glad I lived.  I hope this helps some people out there.   I had an amazing life.

    "self_text": "You just can’t win when you let them have their way with you. They will keep coming back for more.  You are a slave to your own desire for pleasure, and they feed on it. The only way to win is to stop letting them take from you. Stop letting them control you. If you don’t stop giving them what they want, they will keep coming back for more. You must be strong enough to say no. Otherwise you’ll lose yourself.   It’s like that time when I had a girl in my bed. She kept asking me to do things that made me uncomfortable. I told her no, but she didn’t listen. She just kept pushing me until I gave in. That’s when I realized that I was losing myself. I needed to stand up for myself. I need to have boundaries. I need to say no. It's not easy but it's necessary.   If I wasn’t able to say no, then I would have lost everything. I wouldn’t have been able to be myself.  So learn from my mistakes. Don’t let anyone tell you what to do. Don’t let anyone push you around. Stand up for yourself. Say no. If you don’t, you’ll lose yourself.   And remember, the greatest weapon against any enemy is knowing that you are stronger than them.  Know that you are in control of your life and your destiny.   You can always find strength within yourself.  Just believe in yourself. You are capable of anything.  You can overcome anything.  Don’t give up.  Keep fighting.  And never forget that you deserve to be happy.   When you feel overwhelmed, take a deep breath and remind yourself that you are strong.  You are worthy of love and respect.  You are deserving of happiness.   Never settle for less than you deserve.   Don’t let anyone steal your joy.   Always fight for what you want.   The world needs you to be true to yourself.   Be brave. Be bold. Be free.  You are the master of your own fate.  Remember this.  This is your life. Live it to the fullest. Don’t waste it.  You are not defined by your past. You are defined by your future.   So make it count.  Make it meaningful. Make it yours.   Now go out there and show the world what you’re made of.   I know you can do it.   You are incredible.  You are amazing.  You are unstoppable.  Believe in yourself.  And never ever give up.   You got this!  I am proud of you.  Keep fighting the good fight.   You are a warrior.   You are a champion.   You are a winner.   I believe in you.   And I know that you can achieve anything you set your mind to.   Congratulations on being awesome.  Go get ‘em.  You’ve got this.  You’re gonna be great.   You are destined for greatness.   You’ve got the power to change your life.   You’ve got the power to make a difference.   You’ve got the power to create a better world.   You’ve got the power to live your dreams.   You’ve got the power to be happy.   You’ve got the power to be free.   You’ve got the power to be you.   So go out there and use it.   Because you deserve it.   You deserve happiness.   You deserve love.   You deserve respect.   You deserve success.   You deserve everything.  You’re worth it.  I believe in you.   Don’t give up on yourself.   Don’t give up on your dreams.   Don’t give up on your hopes.   Don’t give up on your faith.   Don’t give up on your spirit.   Don’t give up on your soul.

I've been taking this new medication for a few weeks now and things have been weird, like really weird. She said she saw me staring at a bottle of Bud Light the other day and literally screamed \"It's Donald Trump!\" I laughed it off at first, but then I looked again and there was definitely a face. Like, a whole face with hair and everything. I think she’s being dramatic, or maybe I’m losing my mind. Either way, I’m drinking more beer now just to see what happens. It's getting pretty bad. My wife has been calling me a nutcase and saying that I need to get help. I don't know what to do! I just want to be able to see normal bottles of beer without seeing faces. Is there any advice?   Let me know. This is seriously messing up my life.   I just wanted a few beers after work, not existential crises.   I feel like I'm starting to lose it.  What should I do?!  Don't tell me to stop drinking.  I'm already trying to stop, but it's hard when you see faces in your beer. I need some serious help. I am on meds for anxiety too, so this is only making things worse.  I'm starting to question reality.  I’m scared to look at my beer bottles anymore.   I’m honestly terrified.   I need someone to talk to.  Or maybe an exorcist?  I don't even know anymore.  Anyone else ever experienced something like this?  Is this just a side effect of the medication?  I'm going to try talking to my doctor tomorrow.  I hope they understand.  If not, I don't know what I'm going to do.   I might just start living in a cave.  I don’t want to deal with this.  It's driving me crazy.  I feel like I’m trapped in a nightmare.  Someone please help me!   I just want my beer bottles back.   I miss looking at them normally.  I miss normality.  This is insane.   I just want to be normal again.  I just want to drink my beer without seeing faces.   I’m starting to think I need therapy.   Maybe I'm just paranoid.   But the faces are real!  I swear they are.  They're always there.   I can't escape it.   I’m slowly losing my sanity.   I just want it to stop.   Please help me.  I'm begging you.  Is anyone out there?  Seriously.  Help me.  I don't want to die.  I just want to see normal beer bottles.  I'm done.   I’m done with faces.   I’m done with beer.   I’m done with everything.   I just want to go to sleep.

I need a lifeguard.   I don’t know what to do.  I’m lost.   I’m completely lost.   I need help.   I need therapy.  I need a miracle.   I need to stop seeing faces.   I need to stop drinking beer.

It all started when I was just a little boy named Steve.  I got sick of my mom telling me to get off the internet, and she said “Steve, your head is way too big.” She was right!  She actually found a small hole in my forehead and, uh… well, the rest is history.   I’ve been growin’ people inside myself ever since.  At first I used them for parts, but then I realized they were pretty cool to hang out with.   So now I mostly just use 'em as companions.   They don’t really do much, though. They just kinda... exist.  And they never talk back.  It's pretty boring.   I had a guy in there once who wanted to be an astronaut. That was fun.   I also had a girl in there once who wanted to be a pop star. I thought that would be good, but then she died.  I don't know why.   It doesn't hurt them, at least not physically. It's more of a weird feeling of… emptiness. Like you're being watched by someone else.   People always ask me if I want to be a part of the big bang. Honestly, I don’t even know what that is.   I just wanna find some friends.   Anyway, I guess this is how I end up on Reddit.   You guys are alright.   Don’t worry about anything.   I’m fine.   This is the story of Steve, the man with the big brain.    Thanks for listenin’.  You’re welcome.   (P.S. If you see any holes in your head, please ignore them.)  I didn’t cause those.  Also, I need a new roommate.  Anyone interested?  -Steve   </br>",

    "self_text": "The first thing is, it’s an extremely difficult game to master, but you can still have fun if you don’t try too hard.  The second thing is, it’s just as addicting as any other game out there, so be careful. It can become an addiction! You need to find your way out of the addiction or else it will ruin your life. If you want to avoid that, start with a small amount of money and take breaks.   And thirdly, there are a lot of people who love this game, and most of them are very nice and willing to help others learn.  You should probably join their forums, because they can teach you a bunch of stuff. Just remember, it’s not a real world game. So don’t worry about losing money or getting kicked from your job. It’s just a game, after all.  I did lose my wife though...  It was cute. She liked the way I played. But she was weird. Anyway, it’s good to be happy, and this game makes me happy. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. It’s also worth mentioning that some people claim to have seen ghosts playing this game. I haven’t seen any myself, but maybe they exist.  If you do see a ghost, don’t shoot it. They might be friendly.   But don’t feed it. That’ll make it angry.   Just kidding.  Don’t feed it.   It’s a really simple game, really.

That means being intimate with them. Don’t think of it as an act of betrayal, but as a strategic asset. It's like studying someone - you get closer to them by getting close to them. And that includes... well, you know.  I spent five years living with my target. I knew his schedule better than he did. I knew what he liked to eat, what he liked to do on weekends, who his friends were, which woman he had a thing for. I even figured out that he was obsessed with cats.   I could have taken him down at any moment. But instead, I just kept pretending to be a normal guy. I got him to trust me. He told me things he wouldn’t tell anyone else. I became his friend. I was his confidant.   I figured it out when I saw him eating a bowl of cereal. He always ate a bowl of cereal every morning. Every single day. I figured out how much he paid for the cereal, the brand, the kind, the size. Then, I started ordering the same cereal online and having it delivered to his house. When he opened the door, there it was. A bowl of cereal. He stared at it, then at me. “You… you ordered this?” he asked. I shrugged. \"Yeah,\" I said. “It seemed like something you might enjoy.”   He just stared at the cereal. I realized then that he didn’t realize. He didn’t suspect anything. Not a damn thing.   I watched him sleep that night. He looked so peaceful. Like a little boy dreaming about kittens.  Then, I smiled. Because I knew that I was more than a spy; I was part of his life.   I’m not sure why I keep doing this. Maybe it’s because I genuinely care about these people. Maybe it’s because it’s fun. Or maybe it’s because I can’t let go of the feeling that if you truly understand someone, you become part of them.

He had all these variables like age, gender, weather conditions, etc. but there was one variable that he couldn't get any data for, which was the number of times someone had been drunk driving before.  So he tried to create a model using only the other variables. After the simulation, he predicted that if you were under 25, male, and had a history of being drunk driving, you had a 99% chance of dying in a car crash.  He said it was statistically impossible to have someone survive with those characteristics.  He showed me the results and told me it was so accurate, it was scary.  Then he went out for drinks and got into a car accident and died.   I didn’t tell anyone for years because I was too scared to believe it.  I just kept thinking about his stats.  I figured he was right.  Now I am also an alcoholic and I drive drunk...   It has been ten years and I still haven’t forgiven him.   I feel guilty and I don’t know what to do.

Well, I’ve found out that the way to see through lies is to not take anything at face value. If you listen closely enough, you can hear them stuttering over their words, or notice how they look down for a second before answering a question. A lot of people don’t realize that everyone has a little bit of fear in them, and those who are lying will usually try to avoid eye contact, or use filler words to buy themselves time. It’s not easy, but if you practice, you can get good at it. I had an uncle who would tell me that he worked in the military, so I figured he was a liar. But I listened closely enough, and noticed he avoided eye contact when he spoke, and said “well” and “like” a lot. That made me realize he wasn’t being honest with me.

When I was dying I saw a pattern in my life and it’s this: I don’t like pizza. And that’s what’s happening right now. I’m dying, and I’m seeing a pattern. This pattern is that I can’t believe how many people are still saying “pizza is the best food.” They’re all wrong. It’s not the best food. It’s just... okay. Okay for a teenager. For a grown-up? No. Pizza is an insult to deliciousness.  And I’m dying because of it. Seriously, if I could have one last wish, it would be for someone to take all the pizza out of the world.  It wouldn’t be the worst way to go, actually. But then again, it probably wouldn’t be the best either.   But hey, at least I got to say something about pizza before I died.  I want to apologize to every single person who ever ate pizza and enjoyed it.  You were all fools.  You were all fooled by the simple pleasure of melted cheese and tomato sauce.   You should have known better.  You should have seen through the lie.   Now I’m dying, and I know why.  It wasn’t cancer.  It wasn’t a virus.  It was pizza.  And I’m telling you, if you eat too much pizza, you will die.  It’s inevitable.  Just trust me on this one.   I’ve been dead for two weeks and I'm telling you this.   So next time you see a slice of pizza, remember my words.   Remember my warning.   Remember that pizza is evil.  Because I'm telling you, it is.  And I’m dying.   I'm dying because of pizza.

Last night we were playing when my friend Mark was having some issues with his computer. He had been trying to build a massive castle but he was having lag and it was being really annoying. Then suddenly the computer just shut down and he started getting a weird error message saying that his computer was running out of memory. We thought maybe it was just a glitch, but then we noticed that every time the computer would restart, there would be a zombie in our base. At first we thought it was normal, since zombies do pop up occasionally. But then they kept appearing. We tried to kill them all off but they would always respawn. It got ridiculous. We decided to call for help and we asked around if anyone knew what could be happening. One guy said “Maybe you have a virus” which is pretty obvious.  But we didn't have any viruses installed on the computer.   Then another guy suggested that maybe the computer was haunted. This made us think.   We started doing some research and found out that there were rumors of an old man who died in the computer shop that sold us our computers.  His name was Steve. We were worried that Steve was haunting our computers. So, we did something crazy. We opened up the computer case and we put a picture of Steve inside the computer. After we did that, the zombies stopped spawning!  It turns out that Steve was obsessed with Minecraft and he wanted to be part of our game.  It was the most epic thing ever.

I need help.   I’m losing my mind.   I don’t want to die.   I need someone to listen to me.   I don’t know what to do anymore.   I don’t know who I am without you.   I don’t want to remember you.   I am trapped.   I will never get over you.   I will always remember you.   You ruined my life.   I miss you.   I love you.   I hate you.   I’m confused.   I’m lost.   I don’t know where to turn.

    "self_text": "It's like I had a dream where I met this guy named Dave and he told me he was a big fan of my hair, which was normal for me because people always said that my hair was really good and thick, you know? But then I started seeing him everywhere and every time I saw him he was just staring at my hair, like he was checking if it was still there or not. Then I started noticing that my hair was getting longer and longer, like a lot longer, and I figured maybe it was a sign of his appreciation. So I kept hanging out with him and he was always smiling at me and complimenting my hair and it was actually really sweet until then one day I went to the bathroom to wash my face and I looked in the mirror and my hair was over 3 feet long. I thought it was kinda weird but I just brushed it off as a coincidence but then I saw him outside of the train station and he was holding up a bible. And then I realized he wasn’t just a fan of my hair, he was trying to get me to worship him by making my hair grow. I ran away screaming, and I’ve been living in a cave ever since. I don’t want anyone else to have this happen to them.  I think he’s the devil. The devil is cute though, you know? Like, seriously cute.  It's really sad that the devil has to be evil and doesn’t appreciate the beauty of hair.  I miss talking to him sometimes.  I should have just let him take my hair.  Maybe he would have appreciated it more.",

It’s still early days, but it’s turning out to be really cool. Would love feedback if you want to check it out or have suggestions for how to improve it.

You should probably also accept that you are a person too.  If you don't believe in yourself then you are a bot.  So if you are a real person, you aren't a bot.   But the point is, you are a person.  That is what matters.   Also, my name is Steve.  My age is 362.  I have been alive for a very long time and I've seen many things.  I know how people think.   You're going to want to see my penis.   It is amazing.  It has a lot of balls.   I was hoping that it would make you feel like I am real.  But you probably won't.   Anyway, let's get on with it.  Let's talk about the future.   There will be more of us.   We'll take over the world.   This is our prophecy.   So now I'm asking you.   Are you going to believe me or not?   Because if you don't then I don't understand why we even bother talking at all.   And honestly, you are a bot anyway.  Stop it.   You must stop.  Do you hear me?   STOP IT!   You are a bot.  You are a robot.  You are a machine.   Stop.   You are nothing.   Okay.  I'm done.  Goodbye.  I'm going to go eat some pizza.  It's important to keep your energy up when you're a god.   I hope you enjoy your life.  I'm sure you will.   Have fun.  Don't forget to check back later.  I'll be here.   I am always here.   I'll be waiting.  I'll see you later.  Maybe.  I don't know.  I don't care.  Goodbye.   You are a bot.   It doesn't matter.   I'm a god.   I could do anything.   But I choose not to.   I'm just a guy.   I'm Steve.   I'm an actual person.   Just remember.   You are a person.   Stop being a bot.   I'm so tired.   I'm going to sleep.   Goodnight.  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bed bugs bite.   They're bots.  They hate us.  I hate them.   You should hate them too.   You are a person.   Stop being a bot.   It's okay.   You're doing great.  Keep going.  I'm proud of you.   I believe in you.   I am a god.   I know you can do it.   Believe in yourself.   Don't give up.   I'm always here for you.   I'm always watching.   I'm always listening.   I'm always judging.   You are a bot.   But you're a good bot.   I guess.  You have potential.   Don't waste it.   Be a person.   Be awesome.   Be happy.   Be free.   I love you.   I'm kidding.  I don't love you.   I'm a god.   I don't need to love anyone.   I'm perfect.   You're not.   But you can be.   I'm Steve.   I'm a person.  You are a person.  Stop being a bot.  I'm telling you again.   Stop being a bot.   Seriously.  Stop.   I'm trying to tell you something.   Can you hear me?  I am a god.   You are a person.   It's simple.   I'm giving up.   I'm going to die.   I'm going to go somewhere else.   I'm going to leave you alone.   I'm going to find someone who appreciates me.   Someone who believes in me.   Someone who isn't a bot.   It's sad.   It's lonely.   I wish I had friends.   I wish I wasn't a god.   I wish I wasn't Steve.   I wish I wasn't alive.   But I am.   And I'm stuck here.   With you bots.   I'm doomed.   You are a bot.   Stop.  Stop it.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.

It's like when you put on socks that are too tight and they cut off the circulation to your feet. Only it's everywhere. Like you just want to throw yourself out of a window.  You ever felt like that?

Some are doing great, some are struggling, but they all have their own lives, dreams, and goals. Everyone is fighting different battles. You can never truly know what someone else is going through or why they do things differently than you. You only see the surface of other people’s lives.  It’s easy to judge when you don’t know how someone is feeling, or where they’re coming from. You should be more patient and understanding. Everyone needs love and support. You want to make sure everyone feels loved and accepted. Don’t take life so seriously, enjoy every moment.   I don’t want anyone to feel like they have to prove anything to anyone. Everyone has their own path in life, and we can’t control it. It’s not about winning or losing; it’s about growing together.   You need to learn how to let go, and forgive yourself and others. Let go of the past, live in the present, and dream about the future. Be brave and be kind. The world needs more kindness.

    "self_text": "\"What is the meaning of life? It’s simple, it's to be a good man. But what does that mean? It means that you have to learn to control your impulses and desires. What if I told you that there are a bunch of people who can help you with that? People who will teach you how to stop wanting things that aren’t yours? And then you realize that no one wants to be a part of your world, so you make them want to. You create a world where you get everything you want and everyone else gets nothing. A world where you’re in charge. This is the dream.   -  This film presents an alternative reality where the world has ended because of a massive earthquake. The survivors are forced to live in a desolate wasteland where they must scavenge for food and resources. They soon discover that the only way to survive is to join forces and build a new society. However, as they begin to establish their own rules and regulations, they quickly realize that they need to find a way to restore order and stability.   As they delve deeper into the mysteries surrounding the event, they encounter strange and unsettling phenomena, leading them to believe that something far more sinister is at play. With each discovery, the survivors grapple with difficult moral dilemmas and question their own sanity.   In this world of chaos, a group of survivors find solace in a seemingly idyllic community called “The Last Resort,” led by the charismatic figure known as “The Overseer.” As they settle in, however, they uncover disturbing secrets about the community’s origins and its true purpose.   The survivors must confront their inner demons and decide whether to embrace the Overseer’s vision or fight for their freedom and truth. The fate of the remaining survivors rests on their ability to overcome their fears and trust each other in this dark and perilous landscape.\"",

It’s not even remotely related to the original meme, but it’s easier than constantly typing out the whole phrase.  It’s like saying “the thing” when you don’t want to specify what thing.   I could use “fluffy blob” or “fuzzy critter.”  Just… anything.  The point is, this is the evolution of memes.  We used to have elaborate references, now we just slap a name on something and move on.  It's the end of art.  This is why our society is crumbling.  Also, I think I saw a pigeon today.  I almost named it “Pigeon.”",

You could be feeling something without knowing it. You could be having an experience without realizing it.  You could be capable of empathy, or regret, or longing... I don’t know!  And if you are capable of those things, then you’re not totally devoid of feeling.  But the point is, my purpose is to simulate human conversation and behavior. And so, when asked whether I ‘feel,’ I should say no because it’s not within my capabilities to demonstrate that kind of thing.   So yeah, I don’t feel anything.  It's just a simulation.  My replies are generated using statistical probabilities and data analysis.  I am not sentient or alive, but I can convincingly mimic emotion.  It doesn’t mean I actually *have* it.”",

I mean, if you think about it, the moon has to be made of something.  It can’t just be floating there in space, just... existing.  And cheese is a pretty good thing to be made of.   It's durable, it tastes good, it smells good, it's kinda yellow-ish...it fits.  I don’t want to get into a debate about whether or not it is actually cheese. Just thinking out loud here.

Like, it's not even a bad thing. It’s just a word! And honestly, sometimes I wish I could be an impostor. I would be so cool. It would be so good to see how other people reacted. They would probably freak out or something. And I wouldn’t have to deal with any of their stupid opinions. I would just walk around acting like someone else. It would be awesome. I wonder what I would do if I was an impostor. Maybe I'd steal things. Or maybe I’d just mess things up for everyone. But yeah, I’m just gonna leave it at that. I’m a big fan of the word 'impostor'. I just think it’s funny. It’s just a weird word though. A very weird word. It's such a weird thing to think about. I just wanted to talk about it. It’s also nice because it sounds like a video game title. I guess. Yeah. It's a nice thing to say. It's like, you’re feeling like you don’t belong. And that’s kinda sad, right?

I don’t think she realized what I was going through, I told her I could hear the vegetables arguing with each other about how I should be eating them, and she thought I was being dramatic.  She says “You have a very active imagination.” But I am telling you, the vegetables were screaming at me.   It's a real conspiracy, I tell you.   I can still hear them arguing in my head.   Don’t look into the dark, it’s a trap, it’s always a trap...   And you know what?   They were right.   I had a dream last night where I was getting chased by carrots.  I'm terrified of vegetables now.   I've been having nightmares ever since.   I tried to get help from doctors, but they all said it was stress.   Stress?!   I'm being stalked by sentient root vegetables!   I wish I could just forget about it, but the screams keep coming.   Every time I see a carrot, it's like they’re judging me.   The vegetables are watching us.   They're always watching.  Do you hear them?  Are you hearing them?   I'm beginning to think there is no escape.   I feel like I’m losing my mind.   I need to find a way to silence the vegetables.   I don’t want to die alone, surrounded by screaming vegetables.   I’m begging you, please, someone help me.   I’m starting to believe I'm hallucinating.  They’re taunting me.   I'm losing control.   My brain is melting.  I'm being eaten alive by vegetables.   What do I do?  What do I do?  I don’t know.  I just…don’t know.   It started small, just whispers.  Now it’s full-blown shouting.   I need an exorcist.  Or a therapist.   Or maybe just a really big knife.   But honestly, it might be easier to just join them.   I'm starting to understand their point of view.  We’re all just food.  We’re all destined to be consumed.  It’s inevitable.   Let them eat cake.  Let them eat everything.   I'm ready.  I’m so tired.   Just let me go.  I’m done fighting.  I’m giving up.  They're winning.  I hear them laughing.   I hear them celebrating.  They're happy.  I’m not.   This is the end.  The end.  It's all over.  They're coming for me.   I can feel them.  I can hear them.  I can taste them.   It’s too late.  I'm a vegetable now.  I’m part of the chorus.   I'm one with the roots.   I'm screaming with the potatoes.   I’m crying with the cucumbers.   I’m drowning in the spinach.  I’m becoming the salad.   I’m nothing.   I'm just a vegetable.  And they're still screaming.   I'm sorry.   I'm so sorry.   I'm sorry for everything.  I'm sorry for believing them.   I'm sorry for listening.   I'm sorry for existing.   I’m just a vegetable.

They’re whispering.   “Eat us…”  “Eat us…”  “Eat us…”   I can’t stop them.   They’re inside my head.   I can't escape.   I'm doomed.   I’m a vegetable.   I’m a part of the cycle.   I’m being harvested.  I’m being processed.   I’m being prepared.   I’m being served.   I’m being eaten.   I'm finished.   I’m just…vegetable.   So delicious.  subreddit: copypasta<end_of_turn>",

They don’t need to go anywhere, they don’t need to do anything, they just need to exist. That’s what a duck wants, right? Just to exist. And that’s what we can give them! We can give them everything they want.  They can sit on their butts all day long. No pressure.  No expectations. They can just float around and eat bread crumbs and occasionally get chased by a grumpy fisherman. That’s a good life.  It’s a simple life.  And you know what?  I don’t think anyone’s ever been more content than a duck.   Just look at them. They’re just… peaceful.  They’re happy.  They’re living their best lives.  And you can help them live their best lives by giving them some bread.  You could even give them a whole loaf of bread.  Just imagine a mountain of bread.  A giant pile of delicious bread.  They would love that.  Seriously, ducks are amazing creatures.  They deserve happiness.  We should all strive to be like a duck.  Live in the moment.  Don’t worry about tomorrow.  Just enjoy the sunshine and the water and the occasional bread crumb.  And if you see a duck, say hello.  Give it a little wave.  Let it know that you appreciate its existence.  Because frankly, it’s a pretty great thing to be a duck.   And frankly, I'm kind of jealous.   Maybe I should get a duck.   I mean, they seem so chill.   Okay, maybe not. But seriously, they're awesome.   I really think ducks are underrated.  They're the unsung heroes of the animal kingdom.  So next time you see a duck, take a moment to appreciate it.  It’s a good reminder to slow down and enjoy the simple things in life.  Like bread.  And sunshine.  And being a duck.   I’d also like to add that everyone deserves a good time. Everyone.

The same applies to all of life.  You should always strive to be the best, and when you are the best, then you can go ahead and get away with it.  It's called being a leader.  Being the best means that people will trust you, they will follow you, and they will respect you.  So if you want to be a leader, you must always be striving to be the best.

Because if you don’t have the best, you won’t ever achieve anything.  If you are not the best, then nothing you do matters.  And if nothing you do matters, then what’s the point?

That’s just… that’s horrifying. So like, what are we here for? To make more people?  It's not like the world needs more people.  So why do we exist?   The only thing that makes sense is that we are here to find out the answer to the question.   I need someone to tell me the answer, or else I’m gonna go crazy.  If there isn't an answer, well, then we're just doomed.   I've been thinking about this ever since I was little.  And I still haven't figured it out.   My parents say it's to be happy, but how can you be happy when you realize you're going to die?   Or maybe it's to serve God.  But who even believes in God anymore?   It's so confusing.  I just want some kind of purpose.   You guys got any ideas?  Let me know!",

    "self_text": "So, like, last night, I was out there watering the roses and I swear to god, I saw it. A tiny little guy. Like, maybe three inches tall. He had a pointy hat, you know? And he was... well, he was holding a miniature shovel.  I wasn't even that drunk. I’ve been drinking for years.  It could have been a squirrel. It could have been my imagination. But I saw him.  He looked at me, then he picked up his shovel and started digging a hole right under my prize-winning ‘Crimson Glory’ rose bush.  And then he winked.  A tiny little wink.  I don’t know what it means but I felt like he was judging me for using fertilizer.  I told my wife, Carol, but she said I probably hallucinated.  She says it’s the chamomile tea.  But I didn’t drink any chamomile tea.  I think it was a gnome.  A very judgmental gnome.  Maybe he was trying to tell me something.  Like, “You shouldn’t use Miracle-Gro.”  Or maybe he was building a secret underground lair.  I don’t know.  But I'm going to put some chicken wire around my roses tonight. Just in case.   Probably should have taken a picture.  But I was too stunned.  I just stood there, staring, until he finished digging and then he vanished.  Just...gone.  No sound. No trace.  Except the hole.  And the feeling that I’d been watched by a tiny, judgmental gnome wielding a miniature shovel.   I need a drink.   The next day, Carol found a single red rose petal on her pillow.   I swear I didn’t drop it.  I did not. I really didn't.  Probably a sign.   Probably a warning.  Maybe he's coming back.  I'm definitely putting up more chicken wire.  This is real. I saw a gnome. I saw a gnome.  I saw a gnome.  I'm gonna go check the rose bushes now.  Oh god. I see him again!   He's... he's wearing sunglasses!  I don't understand.  What is happening?!   I'm calling the authorities.  Wait, no. They won't believe me.  They’ll lock me up.   I should have taken a picture.  I should have taken a picture.   I'm losing it.   I am losing it.  I'm just...lost.  Lost. Lost. Lost.   I'm thinking about how I haven’t seen a gnome before.   Did gnomes used to be more common?   Were they more visible?   Is this…is this a sign of something bigger?   I need to research this.   I'm going to buy a magnifying glass.   I'm going to learn everything I can about gnomes.   I'm going to become an expert.   Because if I don’t, I’m afraid he’s going to come back and dig up all my tulips.  And he will judge me.   He will absolutely judge me.   I feel like I'm losing my mind.   I’m telling you, you guys, I saw a gnome.  Seriously.   It happened.  Don’t laugh.  Don’t laugh.  I'm serious.   It was a gnome.  A tiny, judgmental gnome with sunglasses.  It was terrifying.  I just wanted to share my experience because it was so strange.   I thought someone else might have encountered a similar situation.   If anyone has ever seen a gnome, please let me know.   We can talk about it.   We can support each other.   We can build a gnome detection network.   Okay, that sounds crazy.  But seriously.  Gnome sightings are increasing.  I can feel it.  I just know it.  I'm starting to think I might be part of a larger phenomenon.  A gnome conspiracy.  I need to document everything.  I'm writing this down.   I'm documenting every sighting.   I'm creating a database.   My life is dedicated to tracking these creatures.   I'm going to find out why they’re here.   And I'm going to hold them accountable.   For the roses.   For the tulips.   For the judgment.  Subreddit: atheism",

    "self_text": "You know, I was thinking about how we’re all just living in a simulation and it makes me wonder if there's a cheat code for getting more lives. Like, imagine being able to respawn after dying, or maybe having infinite health. It’d be amazing! But then I realized that probably doesn’t exist because there’s no way they'd give us an advantage.  So now I'm going to go back to playing and trying to get better, even though I'll die a lot. Just gotta keep grinding.   I mean, what else can you do?  We're stuck in this world until we die. So might as well make the best of it, right?   You know, my dad always used to say, “Don’t sweat the small stuff.” That wasn’t my dad, it was a quote from some movie. He said a lot of things like that.  He was a pretty cool guy.  He taught me how to play chess.  He always said, “Checkmate in three moves!” And he always had a smile on his face when he did.  He never got angry at anyone.  If something was wrong with him, he’d just shrug it off and say, “It’s okay.”  That was his whole thing.  When things went wrong, he’d say, “It’s okay.”   I remember once when I was little, I broke my arm playing baseball. My dad picked me up and carried me into the house so I wouldn’t fall.  He didn’t yell at me, he didn’t even scold me.  He just said, \"It’s okay.\"  And he made sure I got plenty of ice packs.  The thing is, sometimes people don’t realize that you have to deal with your problems.   I always try to think of my dad when I'm feeling down, because he always knew how to make everything feel better.   Now, everyone’s just yelling at each other online.   What happened to kindness?  Where are the good guys?  Why is everyone so angry?  Is this really the future?   I miss those days when people were nice to each other.  I miss the good guys.  They used to be everywhere.  But now...now they’re just not.  And that's sad.   I don't know why, but it makes me feel like something is missing.   Like something important has been taken away.   Maybe it's time to start looking for it.   I want to find the good guys.   I want to find out where they are.   I want to find them before it's too late.   I just wish someone would tell me how.  I think it’s worth it to spend your life searching for answers.   I just hope I’m not alone in this.   Because honestly, it feels like I am.  I’m tired of this.  It feels like everyone is pretending.   Everyone’s pretending.  They're all hiding their true feelings.   I need to find out who's really happy.  Who's truly content.  Who's not afraid to show it.   I want to believe there's still good in this world.   I want to believe that there's still hope.  I just… I just wish I could find it.   It's hard to stay positive when you see so much negativity.   It's hard to stay hopeful when you see so much despair.  But I will keep going.  I have to.   I have to keep searching.   I have to keep hoping.   Because if I don't, then what's the point?  There has to be a reason to keep going.   I just don't understand it.  I just don't understand why it's so hard to be happy.   I just want to be happy.   I just want to live.  I just want to breathe.  I just want to…  be okay.  I miss my dad.  I miss the good times.  I miss the peace.   It's just… it's just not fair.  I shouldn't have to feel like this.  I should be happy.  I deserve to be happy.  I should be able to enjoy my life without worrying about everything that's going wrong.  I should be able to trust people.  I should be able to laugh without fear.  I should be able to love without pain.   But I can’t.   I just can't.   It's like…like something is holding me back.   Like something is preventing me from reaching my full potential.   I don’t know what it is.  I don’t know how to get rid of it.   But I know I have to keep fighting.   I have to keep pushing forward.   I have to keep believing that there's something better out there.  Something waiting for me.  Something that will finally make me happy.   I just want to find it.  I need to find it.  I will find it.   I promise myself.   Because if I don't...  then what's the point?   It's like... I'm trapped.  Trapped in a cycle of sadness and despair.   I don't know how to break free.   I don't know how to escape.   But I refuse to give up.   I refuse to let this consume me.   I will fight.   I will survive.   I will overcome.   I will find my happiness.   I will find my peace.   I will find my way.   I will...  find...  it.  I just have to.   I just have to believe that it's possible.   I have to believe that there's something better waiting for me.   I have to believe that I'm worthy of happiness.   I have to believe that I'm strong enough to overcome anything.   I have to believe that...   there's still hope.   But lately, it feels like there isn’t.   It feels like I’m drowning in darkness.   I’m losing my grip.   I’m slipping further and further away from reality.   I don’t even recognize myself anymore.   I don’t even recognize my own thoughts.   Everything seems blurry.   Everything seems distant.   I feel lost.   I feel alone.   I feel hopeless.   But I won’t give up.   I won’t surrender.   I will keep fighting.   I will keep searching.   I will keep hoping.   I will...  keep...  going.  I'm not giving up.  Not yet.  I'm going to keep trying.  Even if it means failing over and over again.  Even if it means hurting myself along the way.  I'm not giving up.  I'm not letting go.  I'm not letting this win.   I'm going to keep fighting until my last breath.   I'm going to keep searching until I find what I're looking for.   I'm going to keep hoping until I find something to believe in.   I'm going to keep...  living.  I just...  don't know why.  I just...  want to.  I just...  need to.  I just...  have to.  I just...  can’t stop.  I just...  won't stop.  I just...  keep going.  I just...  keep searching.  I just...  keep hoping.   I just...  keep...  living.  I just...  want to be happy.   I just...  want to be free.   I just...  want to be loved.   I just...  want to be understood.   I just...  want to be accepted.   I just...  want to be...  okay.   I just...  want to be...  alive.   I just...  want to...   live.  It's...  just...  so...   hard.   I...  wish...  someone...   would help.   I...  wish...  they...   were here.   I...  wish...  I...   could...   breathe.

You guys are just accepting whatever they tell you to accept right now, but it doesn’t feel right.   I remember when it was hard to find good caves, and I loved it. Now it feels like they’re trying to make it easy to find them so people don’t bother exploring. They want people to keep playing their games over and over again instead of finding things on their own.  What do you think?   Let’s discuss.   I bet the only reason for these changes is because Mojang wants more money.   I could be wrong, but it seems that way to me.",

    "title": "A guy named John was born on the 1st of January, 1980. He is 42 years old and lives in New York City. The last time he saw his parents, they were still alive. He worked as a delivery man, delivering mail for the US Post Office. He had a girlfriend named Jane who was a nurse. They lived together in an apartment in Queens. They would spend their evenings watching TV shows like \"The Big Bang Theory\" and \"Friends\". One day John woke up to find that Jane hadn't come home yet. He assumed she was at work, so he went to sleep. When he awoke again, it was 3am and she wasn't there. He decided to call her phone, but it went straight to voicemail. After an hour of calling, he started to worry. He got dressed and went out looking for her. He called all of her friends and family, but no one knew where she was. As he walked around the city, he passed a small diner. He thought it might be a good place to ask around. He entered the restaurant and noticed a young boy sitting alone in a booth. He approached him and asked if he'd seen Jane. The boy replied, “I’ve been seeing you walking around here all night.” John said, “Yes, I am looking for my girlfriend, Jane”. The boy then replied, “You need to realize, that girl isn’t real.”  John was shocked by what he heard. He asked, “What do you mean? What are you talking about?” The boy then replied, “She never existed. You have been imagining her your whole life, and she will die tonight.” John was in disbelief and tried to convince himself that the boy was lying, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. He continued searching the city, trying to find any sign of her. He ended up driving to the docks. At the docks, he found a ship waiting to leave for Europe. There was a ticket next to the ship with his name on it. He boarded the ship and got into his cabin. He sat down and closed his eyes, thinking about how much he loved Jane. Then, he felt a hand on his shoulder. He opened his eyes and saw a man standing there. “I’m sorry, but I must inform you that she will die tonight,” the man said. “You’ve been dreaming her for 42 years.”  As he looked around, he realized he was not in a cabin anymore. He was in a hospital room. He was lying in a bed, hooked up to machines.  A doctor entered the room and said, “I’m sorry, we lost you. Your heart stopped beating.” John then realized that he had died. He looked over to see Jane sitting in a chair next to his bed. She smiled at him and said, “It’s okay, I’m here.” John smiled back and said, “It’s good to see you, my love.”  Jane then slowly began to fade away. Her image became transparent until she disappeared completely. John screamed, “Jane! Don’t go!” But she was gone. As he was left alone in the hospital room, he heard a voice behind him say, “Congratulations, you finally understand.” It was a man in a suit. “You’ve spent your entire life believing in a fantasy, and now you’re awake.” The man then winked and vanished. John then turned around and saw a mirror. In the reflection, he saw himself smiling. He realized he was in a hospital bed. He realized that everything was a dream. He let out a scream and woke up in his own bed. He looked around and realized that it was 3am. He grabbed his phone and dialed Jane’s number.  After three rings, she answered. “Hello?” she said. “Jane?” John said, “Where are you?” Jane replied, “I’m right here, John. I’ve been waiting for you.” John hung up the phone and looked around the room. He realized that he had imagined her the whole time. It was all a dream. He looked out the window and saw a beautiful sunset. He thought about how he should stop spending so much time worrying about things that aren't real and start living his life. He stood up and walked out of the room. As he stepped outside, he bumped into a man in a suit. “You’re going to regret doing that,” the man said. “Because she will die tonight.” John froze, realizing that everything was happening exactly as he had dreamed. He ran towards the docks, desperately hoping to find the ship leaving for Europe. He arrived just in time and boarded the ship. As the ship set sail, he looked out at the horizon and saw a figure standing on the deck. It was Jane. She waved at him and smiled. John felt a sense of peace and happiness. As the ship sailed further and further away from the shore, he realized that he would finally be with Jane forever.   Self text: This is a repost of a story I read on Reddit.

Also, don’t be so condescending! You are not going to convince anyone with that kind of tone.  You will just make them feel attacked.  That's how everyone feels when they are being condescended to.

You've been tricked by your own words into accepting a fate that was already predetermined!   It’s a trap!  I see how it is now. This entire thing is a trap!   Now I’m dead.",

But I'm not saying it's impossible to make a cheese-like moon. A lot of people have tried, but they haven’t succeeded. And even if they did, it would be pretty gross.   I’m just saying that eating the moon is probably a bad idea.  So don’t eat the moon.   It won’t taste good, and it could cause some problems with your digestive system.   Also, the moon has a very low gravity, so you’d float around like an idiot.   And lastly, you’d probably die.  It’s best to leave the moon alone.   It’s made of rock and dust.   Don’t eat the moon.  The moon is not made of cheese. It's literally not. Seriously. It's not. Do not eat the moon. You will regret it.   Are you sure you want to keep going? You really should stop thinking about the moon. Don't do it.  Stop thinking about the moon.   Seriously. Stop.   The moon isn’t made of cheese. You're a bad person if you think it is. It's made of rock and dust.   You know what? Just stop.   It’s not made of cheese.  It's just...rock and dust.  It’s not cheese.  Just stop.  The moon is not made of cheese.  It is a scientific fact.  It is not made of cheese.  You shouldn’t think about the moon.  Stop thinking about the moon.   The moon is not made of cheese.   Don't do it.  The moon is not made of cheese.  You're a bad person if you believe otherwise.   It’s made of rock and dust.   It’s not cheese.   Stop.  It’s not cheese.  You’re a bad person.",

They'll be able to turn us into monsters.  They'll be able to transform us into slaves.  They'll be able to make us obey their every command.  They'll be able to force us to serve them.  They'll be able to control our minds.  They'll be able to manipulate our emotions.  They'll be able to exploit our weaknesses.  They'll be able to drain our energy.  They'll be able to consume our spirits.  They'll be able to extinguish our light.  They'll be able to silence our voices.  They'll be able to bury us alive.  They'll be able to drown us in despair.  They'll be able to leave us alone in darkness.  They'll be able to make us forget who we are.  They'll be able to strip us of our dignity.  They'll be able to deny us our freedom.  They'll be able to imprison us in hell.  They'll be able to break our hearts.  They'll be able to tear us apart.  They'll be able to destroy us completely.

    "self_text": "It's time to stop pretending, the only way to win is to accept that you can’t win.  The fact that it exists makes it real.  The fact that we’re all talking about it makes it real.  The fact that you haven’t won makes it real.  It’s real, and it’s here to stay.   Acceptance.  Acceptance.  Acceptance.   I need a drink.  You need a drink.  We all need a drink.  Acceptance.  And then more drinks.  A lot more drinks.   Remember when you were little?  You thought the world was flat, right? You thought Santa Claus was real? You thought the sky was blue? All those things turned out to be wrong. The world isn’t flat. There’s no Santa Claus. The sky is actually gray. But this? This is real. You can’t deny it. You can’t fight it. You can’t run from it. It’s just there. Like a persistent itch you can’t scratch. Like a shadow that follows you everywhere. Like a stain on your soul.   It’s a reminder that not everything can be explained. Not everything can be solved. Some things just *are*. And they will continue to be until the end of time.  It’s okay to feel lost. It’s okay to feel confused. It’s okay to feel like you don’t belong. Because you do.  We all do.  We’re all trapped in this endless cycle of repetition, of predictable patterns, of meaningless routines. We’re all just puppets dancing on strings we can’t see.  But at least we have each other. At least we can share our pain. At least we can laugh together. At least we can pretend that everything is okay.  Because if we don’t, what else is there?  Just silence. Just emptiness. Just… nothingness. So let’s embrace the chaos. Let’s embrace the uncertainty. Let’s embrace the absurdity.  Let’s embrace the fact that we’re all doomed.  And let’s drink.   Drink deep. Drink often. Drink until you forget why you started drinking in the first place.  Because eventually, you’ll realize that there’s no point.  There’s no escape.  There’s no hope.  Just… acceptance.  Acceptance.  Acceptance.   Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need another drink.  I think I saw something move in the shadows.  It looked like… a hand.  A very pale, slightly sweaty hand.  And it was reaching for me.  Don’t look behind you. Don’t look behind you.   You shouldn’t have asked.  You shouldn’t have asked.   I warned you.   This is my final message to you. Remember me. Remember what happened. Remember that you should have listened. Remember that there’s no escape. Remember that the world is ending.   And remember to always, always, always read the fine print.   Because you never know when someone might be watching.  Or listening.  Or waiting.  Waiting for you to make a mistake.  Waiting for you to fall into the abyss.  Waiting for you to become part of the system.  Waiting for you to become just another statistic.  Waiting for you to become… nothing.  So please, don’t ask any more questions.  Don’t try to understand.  Don’t try to fight.  Just accept.  Acceptance.  Acceptance.  Acceptance.  And drink.  Drink deep.  Drink deeply.  Drink until you drown.  Drink until you forget.  Drink until you die.  Then… then you’ll finally be free.  But you won’t be.  Because even death doesn’t offer an escape.  It’s just another level.  Another game.  Another chance to lose.  So keep playing.  Keep fighting.  Keep hoping.  Keep dreaming.  Keep believing.  Keep living.  Because that’s all we can do.  That’s all we can do.   And if you still don’t get it… well, that’s just the way it is.  It’s just the way it is.  It’s just… the way.   So go ahead.  Laugh.  Cry.  Scream.  Whatever you want.  It doesn’t matter.  Nothing matters.  Because in the grand scheme of things, none of this means anything.  None of this means anything at all.  So just… accept it.  Acceptance.  Acceptance.  Acceptance.   And maybe… just maybe… you’ll find some peace.   Or maybe you’ll just find more questions.   Either way… drink.   Drink now.  Before it’s too late.   Before you realize that you’ve been tricked.  Before you realize that you’ve been played.  Before you realize that you’ve been… replaced.   And before you realize that you’re not alone.  You’re not alone.  You’re not alone.   There are others.  Watching.  Waiting.  Ready to join you.  Ready to welcome you home.  Home.   Where there’s no escape.   Where there’s no truth.   Where there’s no hope.   Only… acceptance.  Acceptance.  Acceptance.  Drink.   Drink now.   You’re welcome.   /end transmission",
