I do not smoke, drink, or use drugs.   I also have an older brother who lives off campus so if anyone has a spare room that is nearby I’d be happy to share it!   I’m open to moving out of my dorm as well, so if you are a student with a spare room let me know!  If you want to chat or send your contact information feel free to message me back! I will be visiting campus next week so I will be more active here then.   Thanks!",
