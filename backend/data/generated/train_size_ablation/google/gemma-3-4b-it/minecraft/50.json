I got caught up experimenting with biomes, and somehow managed to get into an infinite loop of spawning and dying. It took me hours to figure it out, but I finally figured out how to stop the spawning/dying cycle. However, due to the sheer number of blocks that had been destroyed, I lost almost all my progress and resources.  Now I'm starting over from scratch.   I'm super bummed because I put a lot of work into that world, and it's really frustrating to lose everything like that.  I’ve decided to start over, but I want to do things a little differently this time around.   I'd love to hear if anyone has any tips or advice for building a good base early on, or anything else they think is important to keep in mind when rebuilding a world from scratch. Any suggestions are welcome! Thank you!",
