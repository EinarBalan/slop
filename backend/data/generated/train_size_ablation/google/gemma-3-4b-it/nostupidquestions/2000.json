However, after using it for about a week, I noticed some green mold growing on the bottom of the bottle. It’s not all over, just around the bottom. This happened with my last water bottle, and it was exactly the same situation.   I tried washing it thoroughly with soap and water, but it still came back again.  It’s not like I didn’t wash it immediately when I first used it; I washed it right away. So what should I do? Is there anything else I can use to clean it better, such as bleach?  Is this something I need to worry about?  If so, how long does it take for it to start forming mold again? How often should I clean it? Should I buy another one? Please help!",
