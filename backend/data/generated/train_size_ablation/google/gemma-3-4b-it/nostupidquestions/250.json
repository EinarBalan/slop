I know that many conspiracies are just made up for entertainment, but what if someone actually believes in a conspiracy because they see some “evidence” or have a specific reason to believe it?  For example, let’s say I found some odd connections between events in my town, so I thought I would do research on the topic, and then found some information online supporting an idea that is completely ridiculous. Does that mean I’m a part of a conspiracy, or am I just misinterpreting data?  Do I become a target of the conspiracy after that?   I feel like people are trying to convince me that the only way to not be part of a conspiracy is to ignore any other evidence, and just accept whatever narrative is presented.

Like if i was watching an animated movie, I could be transported into that world and would probably experience the same things as those characters did in their lives.
