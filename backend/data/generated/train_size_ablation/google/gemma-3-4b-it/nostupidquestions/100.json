However, I've been researching the process more, and the requirements are pretty strict.  It seems that there is no way to get a card through the state of california. Only certain doctors can prescribe it, which limits who gets access. Also, many insurance companies won't cover the cost of getting a card, and some don't even allow their patients to be covered by the plan, so they end up paying out-of-pocket for the entire thing.   I am considering going into the doctor and asking about obtaining one, but I also want to see what other options might be available.   The requirements are: - Must have a qualifying medical condition - Must have a doctor who will write you a recommendation (not a prescription) - Must provide proof of residency - Must pay a fee ($100)   Also, many people in California use the \"smoker's license\" or \"medical marijuana registry\" as a way to gain access to the product without having a medical marijuana card.
