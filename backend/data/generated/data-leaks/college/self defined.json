    "self_text": "The AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine (Vaxzevria) has been linked to rare but serious side effects such as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). This condition involves blood clots combined with low platelet counts, which can lead to internal bleeding. Symptoms include severe headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, leg swelling, or redness in the arm where the injection was given. Individuals experiencing these symptoms should seek immediate medical attention.  It's important for healthcare providers to be aware of TTS when administering the AstraZeneca vaccine and to monitor patients closely for any warning signs. A recent study published in The Lancet suggests that women aged 30-49 may have an elevated risk of TTS after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine. However, other studies have found no increased risk in this age group. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended that individuals who experience TTS after vaccination should receive treatment with heparin to prevent further clotting.  The potential risks associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine must be carefully weighed against the benefits of vaccination, especially during times of high transmission of the virus.  This information is intended for educational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice. If you have concerns about your health or the COVID-19 vaccine, consult with a healthcare professional.",

The whole thing was a mess and I don't want to think about it anymore. I'm trying to move forward in my life but sometimes I can't help but feel sad or frustrated about what happened. I know it's over now but the memory still haunts me. But it wasn't just about the cheating; there were other issues between us too. We had our problems before he started seeing someone else. He was always a bit of a jerk but I thought we could work things out if we tried. Maybe I was wrong? I don't know. I have no idea what to do next. Maybe I should just forget about him completely and focus on myself. But it's hard not to dwell on the past. Sometimes I wish I could turn back time and prevent everything from happening.  I'm sorry for whatever pain I caused him, and I hope he's doing okay. It sucks that he has to deal with all these feelings as well. Let's just be honest, people make mistakes. It doesn't mean they're bad people or that you did anything wrong. They might have their reasons, even if those reasons aren't good enough. I'm just glad I learned something valuable from this experience. It's better to cut ties than to let someone drag you down with them. If they're going to be a toxic person, it's best to move on. I'm not saying he's a terrible person—maybe he's just struggling with something himself. But I can't keep being involved in his problems. My mental health comes first. So I'm letting go of the past and moving forward. I need to find peace and happiness, and I won't allow anyone to steal that from me. I'll remember what happened and use it to grow stronger. I'll learn from my mistakes and make sure I never repeat them. This situation made me realize how important it is to protect my heart. I deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. I won't settle for less. And if someone tries to take advantage of me, I'll stand up for myself. I'll never give up on finding love again. I believe in second chances, but only if it's meant to be. I'm focusing on building a happy and fulfilling life for myself. No more regrets!  I am grateful for the lessons I have learned. I will never look back on this chapter with sadness. I am moving forward with confidence and joy. Life is beautiful and full of possibilities. I am excited to see what the future holds. Thank you for listening.  If anyone needs to talk, I'm here.

He hated it and said it tasted like poison and then he proceeded to complain about how much he hated the texture and how it made his stomach hurt.  I thought to myself that he was a terrible person.

I've been posting videos about the way things have been going here and there have been some issues that need to be addressed. I think people have been scared to come forward because they don’t want to risk their careers or reputations. Well, shame on them.  I’ve seen some comments saying “what do you even know?” which honestly is not fair. They are all so quick to point fingers at me when they have been actively involved in these issues for years. What makes me feel like the worst person in the world is how quickly everyone will turn against someone who speaks up or tries to bring light to the truth. You see? I’ve done everything I can to try and educate people on what has been happening here. Now I realize that it isn’t enough, it would seem that nothing I say actually gets through to anyone. This is also a really frustrating situation, especially since most of the people involved are constantly talking down to me and trying to make me look stupid.   You may have noticed I haven’t been active here recently, and it’s because I've been dealing with a lot of personal problems. I was trying to keep my head above water and ignore everything, but eventually, it just became too much.  I needed to take some time off from everything else to sort out my mental health. So I’m taking this time to focus on myself and get back on track.  I appreciate all the support I’ve received, and I hope to be able to continue helping others in the future. I want to thank everyone who’s taken the time to read this and understand what’s been happening here. I sincerely apologize if I’ve upset anyone, and I promise to always strive to improve my communication skills.  I believe that by working together, we can create a more positive and inclusive community. Thank you again for your understanding.",

She had a bit too much at a party last night and drove home in her car with me in the passenger seat. I told her it wasn't safe and she got angry so I refused to go in her car. She then called me multiple times trying to get me to go in her car but I didn't give in. Now she's saying I'm a terrible friend because I won't let her drive home when she's drunk. I don't want to ruin our friendship but I also think it's irresponsible and dangerous to let someone who's drunk drive. What should I do?",

He said that it was fine and that he didn't care about what I wanted as long as he got to spend time with me. Then he started doing things that made me uncomfortable like following me around and staring at me a lot. So I told him to stop. He said that I was being rude and that he wouldn't talk to me anymore if I continued to do that. Then I found out that he was talking about me behind my back to everyone else which made me even more uncomfortable. The other day, I was walking home from school and he saw me. He stopped and asked me if I was free to go get coffee somewhere. I told him no. Then he said that maybe we could go out another time. I told him that I didn't want to go out with him. He then said that maybe he should find someone else to date. I think he was mad about the fact that I did not want to go out with him.

The same thing is true with AI. There are many ways to create intelligent systems (or things that can appear intelligent), but there are also many problems where creating an \"intelligent system\" would be completely unhelpful or even impossible.  I get why people want to use the word because it's cool and sounds complicated, but it really does no one any good to throw around such a loaded word unless you have a specific reason to do so.

I don't think I'll ever be interested in guys. Like, at all. My mom wants me to date so she can have someone to take care of me when she gets old. She keeps saying things like, \"you need to start thinking about the future,\" and \"you'll regret it if you don't.\" But I don't see any point in doing something I don't want to do. It seems really annoying, and honestly kind of stupid.  Also, I'm super busy with school and extracurricular activities. And I hate going out with people who drink. I don't understand why other girls love boys, and I don't want to. If anyone asks me if I'm single, I say no. I don't want to go on dates or be in relationships. AITA?",

    "self_text": "I'm an 18-year-old black girl living in America and recently had a discussion with my parents about going to college. My parents are immigrants from Liberia, where they grew up during the civil war and experienced extreme poverty. They want me to go to college because they believe it will give me more opportunities than they had. However, I am completely uninterested in attending college. I don’t see the value in spending four years of my life racking up debt so that I can work a job that I hate for the rest of my life. Instead, I want to start my own business and build something for myself.  My parents think this is foolish and irresponsible, and that I should do what they did and go to college. But when I told them that I have no desire to do anything that they would have done, they immediately accused me of not appreciating their sacrifices. They said that if I didn’t go to college, then I was essentially rejecting their efforts to provide for me, which is insulting to me because I appreciate everything they’ve done for me. The reason I haven't gone to college is because I know what it’s like to live without money, and I don’t want to end up in that situation again.  I also feel like my parents aren’t really understanding what it means to build a company from scratch; they just assume that it’s easy money. As someone who has grown up with financial instability, I find this perspective incredibly frustrating. So yeah, basically I want to start a business, but my parents think I'm being ungrateful by not following the path they set out for me. AITA?",

And it's so easy to lie around all day, which is why i haven't been going to work.   i've been feeling super depressed and anxious as well, maybe that's part of the problem?  anyway, let's talk about the issue of getting up early in the morning, like between 6am-8am.  i'm trying to do my best to change my habits and wake up earlier so i can go to work on time but my brain won't allow it.  I've tried everything: alarms, sunlight, meditation, motivation, etc., but nothing seems to work. I'm just too tired to get out of bed and start the day.

The reason why the school cancelled the return to school was because there were too many people saying that they wanted to come back and do what was originally planned. But, now that they're cancelling the return to school again, I think it's time for me to share my thoughts on how I feel about everything.  I know a lot of people are probably feeling down about this but I can say that if the school cancels the return to school again, then I will be taking action myself.  I'm not sure what actions I'll take just yet but I will let everyone know when I have figured out more details.   The reason I’m bringing up all of this is to show you guys that I am aware of your feelings and that I sympathize with what you may be going through. And yeah, I know that these things happen but please don’t lose hope or give up on yourselves. Keep trying to do whatever you want to do so that you can live your lives to the fullest. I know that many people might not understand my message but I do need to leave this out there. This is my way of telling you guys that I care about what you’re going through and I want you to keep doing what makes you happy. If you can’t do that, then I understand, but I still want you to know that I’m here for you and I will always be here for you. Also, if you need someone to talk to, then please don’t hesitate to reach out to me as well. You don’t have to deal with all of this alone. There are other people who care about you and want to help you get through it. You also shouldn’t worry about reaching out to anyone because they won’t judge you or anything like that. Everyone has different problems in their own life and everyone needs support at some point.  I just want you guys to know that I'm here to tell you to keep fighting. Fight for your dreams, fight for your goals, and fight for yourself. Don't ever give up on yourself or your beliefs. You have to believe that you can achieve anything you set your mind to. Remember that you are important and that you deserve to be happy.  You should never give up on your dreams no matter how hard it gets.  Don't ever give up on yourself, either.  Everyone says that you need to make sacrifices in order to get where you want to go but it doesn't mean that you have to sacrifice everything.  There are ways to balance your responsibilities and your passions.  If you're struggling to find that balance, then don't be afraid to ask for help.  There are resources available to help you.  I know that it can be difficult to admit that you need help but it's okay to ask for it.  It doesn't make you weak or vulnerable.  It actually takes strength to admit that you need help and to seek it out.  You can be strong and vulnerable at the same time.  And remember that you are not alone.  There are people who love you and care about you.  You can always count on them for support.  And if you don't have anyone to turn to, then you can always call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. They can provide you with confidential support and guidance.  They are available 24/7.  You can call them at 988.  Please don't hesitate to reach out to them if you need help.  I know that things can be tough sometimes.  But I want you to know that you are not alone.  You are loved and valued.  And you have the power to change your life.  So don’t give up on yourself.  Keep fighting.  Keep believing.  Keep dreaming.  And most importantly, keep living.  Thank you for reading this post and thank you for listening. I appreciate you for giving me a platform to share my thoughts and ideas with everyone. I hope that this post helps some people out there.  If you are struggling with any mental health issues, please seek professional help. There are many resources available to help you.

My dad wasn't the most supportive guy during their marriage, and she hasn't gotten over him yet.  I've always tried to be there for her, but lately, she's been constantly calling me every day or multiple times a day, telling me how much she misses her husband, asking me if I think he still loves her, etc.  It's been draining me emotionally, and I can't keep up with that level of constant neediness. My brother doesn't seem to understand why I need a break, as he says \"you should be there for your mom\". But I genuinely feel like I have already done my part. I go visit her regularly, help her with errands, and make sure she takes care of herself. I even offered to pay for therapy sessions for her, which she refused.   My other friends and family members have noticed that I've been distant lately and don't try to reach out as often. They just tell me to \"be more understanding\" and say that I shouldn't take so much on myself.  I think they're right, but I'm struggling with feeling guilty for not being able to provide the emotional support she needs.

    "title": "Why does it feel like the only people who can spell correctly at school are in my class?",
    "self_text": "I've had a really hard time spelling when writing essays and homework assignments in school since elementary school. My teachers have always told me they see how I struggle with spelling but then they let me get away with not doing anything about it, so now I just end up being very bad at spelling and I hate it because my grades suffer as a result. There were times where I was stuck and didn't know what to write next or how to spell something, and all of my friends would have an answer for me while I was completely clueless. Now that I'm older, I still find myself struggling to spell words, and even if I do, they often come out wrong and sometimes I don't know why. Some of my classmates are able to spell perfectly without any errors and they seem to be able to read words as well as they spell them. I've been wondering why they're so good at spelling when I can't do it at all. The reason for this is that there are several reasons that could explain why some students are better at spelling than others. First, the way that we learn to spell differs greatly from person to person. Some people might learn through rote memorization, which means they simply memorize a word by repeating it over and over again until it becomes ingrained in their memory. Other people might learn through phonetic analysis, which means they try to sound out the words and figure out how they're spelled based on the sounds that each letter makes. Still other people may learn through visual cues, such as associating letters with shapes or colors. Second, some people may have an easier time learning to spell than others due to genetic factors. For example, individuals with certain genes are more likely to develop dyslexia, which can make it difficult to learn to spell. Third, some people may have a greater advantage due to early childhood experiences. For instance, children who are exposed to language-rich environments and given ample opportunities to read and write may be more likely to become proficient spellers. Finally, some people may have different strengths and weaknesses that affect their ability to spell.  For example, someone who has difficulty with phonetics may excel in visual cueing. However, despite these differences, most people are able to learn to spell to some extent.  If you want to improve your spelling skills, here are some tips. Read widely and pay attention to how words are spelled. Use flashcards to help you memorize common words. Practice writing words frequently. Get feedback from others on your spelling.  It's important to remember that everyone learns differently, so it's okay if you need to try a few different approaches to find what works best for you. If you're struggling with spelling, don't give up! With perseverance and dedication, you can definitely improve your skills. And if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask your teacher or a tutor for help.",
