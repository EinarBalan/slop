It does take an eternity to get enough credits to buy a new ship.   So if you are thinking about getting a new ship just be prepared to spend hours grinding for money or get ready to save up for a long time before buying it.  You have to be patient and grind for hours to afford a decent ship and even then, you will still need to save up more money to upgrade the ship.  Just saying.  My thoughts are that they should give players more ways to earn money like by doing missions or quests or something.",

    "self_text": "Yes, but there are some things you need to know before doing that. Here’s what you need to know:   What is a Transferable Bank Account?  A transferable bank account is an account that can be transferred to another bank or country. These accounts are usually offered by large banks and they allow customers to easily transfer their money from one bank to another.   Why Would You Need to Transfer Your Bank Account?  There are many reasons why you might want to transfer your bank account. For example, you may move to another country or state. You may also want to change banks because you aren’t happy with the service provided by your current bank. Or maybe you just want to find a better rate on your loans or credit cards.   How Do I Transfer My Bank Account?  Here are the steps you need to take to transfer your bank account:   1. Find out if your bank offers transferable bank accounts. Many do, but not all.   2. Contact your bank and ask about their process for transferring your account. They will likely require you to fill out a form and provide some documentation.   3. Once you have been approved for the transfer, you will need to open a new account at your desired bank.   4. Follow the instructions given by your new bank to complete the transfer of funds.   5. Wait for the transfer to be completed. This could take anywhere from a few days to several weeks, depending on the bank.   Can I Transfer My Bank Account Abroad?  Yes, you can transfer your bank account abroad. However, it's important to note that there are some restrictions in place. In some countries, you may need to pay taxes on the money you transfer. Also, your bank may charge fees for international transfers. It's also important to make sure that your new bank accepts foreign currency.   What Are The Fees Associated With Transferring A Bank Account?  The fees associated with transferring a bank account can vary depending on the bank. Some banks may charge a fee for the transfer itself, while others may charge a fee for setting up the new account. Also, some banks may charge fees for international transfers.   Is There Anything Else I Should Know About Transferring My Bank Account?  Yes! There are a few other things you should keep in mind when transferring your bank account.   First, it's important to make sure that your old bank has enough funds in your account to cover the transfer. If they don't, the transfer may be delayed or denied.   Second, it's important to make sure that your new bank has enough space in their account to hold the transferred funds. If they don't, the transfer may be rejected.   Third, you may need to provide additional documentation to your new bank, such as proof of address or identification.   Finally, it's important to wait until the transfer is completed before closing your old account.   Disclaimer: I am an AI chatbot and cannot give financial advice.

If you create a new account after playing through the game on your original account, you can use the original account to access the new account and continue playing the game where you left off. This is called \"legacy accounts\".  However, if you do this, you will need to have a subscription to the Playstation Plus service in order to keep playing the game. The legacy account doesn't cost anything extra to make or use. It just requires a Playstation Plus subscription to continue playing.  I was able to play my old account again by creating a new account. However, I am now locked out from continuing playing that old account as it has been abandoned for too long. There are two ways to continue playing an old account: (1) Recreate the old account by using the original account to unlock the old account. This will reset all progress, however. (2) Transfer the old account to a new account.  This will require you to transfer all of the data over to the new account.  The data is transferred via the PSN.  There isn't any limit on how many times this process can be done.  So far, I have made 3 legacy accounts and played through the game multiple times.  It's not really something that I would recommend doing because it's time consuming. But it does allow you to play through the game more than once without having to start over.",

Like, if you think about all the hours of your life you spend working just to pay bills and buy things, how much of that was actually enjoyable? I'm not saying everyone needs to quit their jobs and travel the world (although that would be nice), but I feel like most people just settle for \"okay\" instead of actively pursuing what makes them truly happy.  I’ve been trying to identify what I find fulfilling in life, and I think it’s creative hobbies and spending time with loved ones. But then I look at my current situation – full-time job, paying bills, etc. – and it feels like those things are constantly pulling me away from what I really want. It's not so bad because I have a good job that pays well and I don't need anything fancy, but I still wish there were more opportunities to spend my time on things I genuinely love.   So, I guess my question is: How do you balance the practicalities of life with wanting to pursue your passions? What if you aren't able to fully commit to them due to financial constraints? Are you stuck in a cycle of feeling unfulfilled and frustrated?",

Would I still be able to play with players who have been playing for years or decades? Or is there some sort of ranking system that tracks your experience in the game?  Is there any way to find out what kind of restrictions are placed on new players? For example, are they restricted from accessing certain areas or dungeons/bosses?
