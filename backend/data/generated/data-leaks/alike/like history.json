I recently bought a new motherboard, processor, cpu cooler, and ssd to try and fix this. These current specs are MSI MPG B550 Gaming Plus, Ryzen 7 5700x, GTX 1660 Super.  I have 16 gb of ram and 650 watts of power. I had to do a manual bios update with the flash button on the motherboard to allow support for the processor. After fixing my computer I loaded up warzone from my harddrive and played a game. Everything went well. My brother then took a turn after me and right when he clicked to go back to the lobby, the computer, monitor, and all of the lights turned off completely. When we turned it back on, the CPU light went on so we turned it back off immediately. We then turned it on again for the CPU light to go on for a few seconds until it turned off, to the VGA light going on and turning off, to the boot light going on and off, until it began booting normally. I reset my computer and my drives and then redownloaded windows onto my SSD. I redownloaded call of duty but every time I open it, my computer turns off. I can’t even click the button to turn it back on anymore. I have to flip the power supply switch like 4 or 5 times before it finally turns on. Any ideas?",

    "self_text": "My wife and I found a town we like in the Metro East region (Illinois suburbs of St. Louis). The houses here are somewhat affordable at 250k to 400k for a McMansion 2,500 square feet type house, but I worry about the property taxes and the long term fiscal health of the state. I actually used to live in Cook County and the government was enough of a corrupt mess to cause people like me to leave. My fourth b.s. red light violation ticket in the mail was enough. I’m looking for advice on whether it’s a good bet to buy property there.",
