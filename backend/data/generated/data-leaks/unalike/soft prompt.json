I believe Jesus was saying this when he said “Destroy this temple, and I shall rebuild it in three days.”   Jesus says that we should destroy his body (the flesh) and he shall build it up again in three days.  The key here is “destroy” which means to take apart, to break down, or to tear down.   When he said, “Destroy this temple,” he didn’t mean to actually physically destroy the temple, but rather, to tear down the religious system.   So what if the fire was a sign of God’s will?   It could have been for several reasons, such as to make us realize that there are things that we can’t control.   However, the fact that the fire was so severe—it burned everything—would have been a way to show us how much we need to be ready for the end times.",

I’ve been reading up on this stuff lately and it seems like there's a huge amount of symbolism involved with the idea of “shadow”.

The article also states that the hackers used sophisticated hacking techniques, including ransomware and phishing scams.  The story is so intriguing because it shows how far ISIS’s reach has gone. It was thought that their operations were limited to Syria and Iraq, but the fact that they were able to try to hack into the US government proves that they have resources and connections that go beyond what people realize.  The story also raises questions about whether the US government has been doing enough to protect itself from cyberattacks.

However, it is still worth taking it with a grain of salt, as there is always the possibility that the information could be inaccurate or incomplete.

Instead, they decided to just let him die off screen. I understand why they did it (Lisa’s obsession), but they could have done a better job writing it.  I also don’t think the ending was good because it’s the last episode ever. The showrunners must have felt like it would be difficult to come up with something compelling for the final episode, so they went for the easiest option which is killing off Nick. He never got a proper sendoff.  The biggest problem is that the show felt like it was going nowhere at the end of season 2. It had no direction anymore, and nothing seemed to matter anymore. Lisa was obsessed with finding Nick, even though she knew he was dead. She didn't give up and continue trying to solve his case. And you know what?   It’s fine.

I’m writing this to share my recent experience with an intense spiritual growth period and how it was connected to the film “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.” It wasn't something that happened suddenly; it was a gradual process—a slow, quiet shift in my heart. I’ve been reading the book for years, but recently I decided to watch the movie again, intending to simply enjoy the beautiful scenery and the epic battle scenes. However, as I watched the final scene where Frodo finally casts the Ring into Mount Doom, something profound shifted within me. I felt an overwhelming sense of peace, and a deep recognition that the story had been more than just entertainment. It had been an invitation. A prayerful invitation to connect with something far greater than myself.  I know, it sounds cheesy, but I want to explain.   My Spiritual Journey Begins... My journey started about six months ago when I went through a period of depression. I lost my job, my boyfriend left me, and my mother passed away from cancer.   After a few months of feeling like nothing mattered, I realized I needed to make a change. I needed to reconnect with God, and I began attending church again.  However, there were times I would have doubts. Times when I didn’t feel anything or when things would get difficult. Sometimes I would feel angry at God. Why did He let my mom die? Why did He take my job? Why did He let my boyfriend leave me? What good could come out of all of this?  Then I thought, \"Maybe if I didn't pray to Him, He would not be able to help me.\" So I began to pray to God every single day. I would go outside, sit on my porch, and just talk to Him. At first, I talked about my problems. But as I continued to pray, I realized that He wanted me to praise Him.   It’s funny because I used to think that praising God was only for people who were happy and content. But I learned that even when you're going through the darkest times, you can still find beauty and gratitude in God's creation. I’d sit on my porch and look up at the sky, watching the clouds move by, and I would say, “Thank you, God, for the beauty of your world.”   This simple act of gratitude changed everything.   As I continued to focus on praising God, I noticed that my thoughts became calmer and clearer. I was less anxious and depressed. I found a new job, and a new friend who helped me heal. I also came to terms with my mother’s passing.  I still don’t understand why God allows suffering, but I believe that He is always working behind the scenes, even when we can’t see it. And I believe that His love is stronger than any pain.",

Arya kills her. And Sansa makes peace with Littlefinger after he betrayed everyone else. This last one is the most important thing because the ending felt so rushed.

This brother, Hassan, had been raised in a Christian household and Hassan was always the one to invite him to church, to go on picnics, etc.   One day, my Dad came home from work and said he felt like he needed to confess something to me, which was shocking because it's been over 30 years since he last spoke about this event. He told me that when he was younger, he was having an affair with his brother Hassan’s wife. It was a long time ago—the late seventies.  It happened only once, and they both agreed never to speak of it again.   My dad then said that he felt it was important for me to know as he realized that his faith had been shaken ever since. I tried to be understanding but I couldn't stop feeling so hurt. I felt betrayed by someone who supposedly loved me and who taught me to love Islam. I asked why he did what he did, and he simply said he was young and stupid, and that it wasn't a big deal.   I immediately became angry and said I didn’t believe him and that he was lying. I ended up crying and screaming at him. He apologized profusely, saying that he wished he could take it back, but that he knows he can't.   That night, I went to bed and cried myself to sleep.   He never brought it up again. But I’ve carried this guilt with me ever since.   Now, 20 years later, my mom passed away, leaving me alone in the family house. I found a box of old photos and letters and stumbled upon some evidence to support my dad’s confession. Pictures of him holding hands with Hassan’s wife, and letters between them. It confirmed that what he said was true. I still feel heartbroken and confused. Why did he do this? What was going through his mind?  How can I forgive him after all these years?",

With that being said, here are my thoughts on how it would be different:   The Crusades never happened as they did.   Instead, there'd be no religious wars at all, since the holy sites wouldn't be contested by either side.   Islam would have spread more quickly and efficiently across Europe, because you’d have no resistance from Christian kingdoms.  It is possible, and even likely, that the Ottoman Empire would never have risen to power or ever occurred.   The Americas might have been colonized by the Christian European nations, like Spain or Portugal, instead of the Muslim ones.    However, with no Islamic empire, you may not have seen as much trade between Europe and Asia.   Perhaps many Europeans would still be stuck in the Middle Ages, rather than experiencing the Renaissance.   Also, without Islam, countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt could have never existed.

After his parents die, he becomes estranged from his siblings and feels lost and alone.  His sister, Rachel, comes to visit him and they end up going on a trip to see all of the places where their parents lived. They take along their friends, Chloe, and Ben, as they travel through the states and try to find some meaning and purpose in their lives.  As they go to each location, they uncover more about their family history, which leads them to believe that their parents had been living double lives.  They learn that their father was actually a spy during World War II and worked for the US government. The mother also had a secret past, but she had been working undercover for the CIA.  Their parents used these fake identities to protect themselves and their families from harm. It turns out that Jacob's grandmother was part of the CIA too and her brother was a German spy.  At the end of the book, Jacob and his siblings come to terms with their family history and realize that they can move forward together.",

    "self_text": "My PC is dead and I'm not sure what to do, so here's the situation.  I was playing CS2 on my PC when it suddenly shut off and never turned back on. I tried everything, like checking for loose cables, making sure the power supply had enough juice, etc. But nothing worked. Then, I took my PSU out of the case and plugged in another cable from the wall to see if that was the issue, but still no luck.   So I went ahead and opened up the case and checked all the connections on the motherboard. Turns out that the CPU fan connector isn't connected.  I plugged it into the correct port on the motherboard and then reinstalled drivers for the CPU.  Then I started my PC again and it shut down immediately. I figured something broke with the motherboard. So I looked online at the motherboard and saw that the CPU fan connector doesn't have any pins on them. It looks like someone tried to connect it to the wrong port.  Now the question is: Can I fix this? Or does it need to be replaced?",

    "self_text": "I’m currently watching Game of Thrones and, while I love it for many reasons, I have to say that a lot of the timeline feels inaccurate. Like, for example, did Daenerys even reach Westeros before Robert Baratheon died? Did she even have enough troops/resources by then? And the fact that Jon Snow was born after Robert's death seems really strange.  Do you guys think that the writers got the timeline wrong?",

I know what they say about dreams not being true but I have never had nightmares or bad dreams before until now. This has happened multiple times now too, the same car crashing into the same thing over and over again. My heart rate goes up as soon as I see it.  Is there any way to stop these visions? I don’t want to go crazy.",

    "self_text": "I was reading the Quran and it says that Allah forbids any kind of divination or sorcery, but in Islam there is a belief that people can be possessed by evil spirits. Some Sufi orders practice ritual purification through exorcism which involves chanting, prayers, and sometimes physical acts like beating the possessed person to get rid of the demon.  I want to know if that’s true or not.   Do you think they are wrong to do these things?   Is there any evidence for their effectiveness?",

    "self_text": "I'm not sure what to call it, but basically, I had a very vivid dream about Jon and Daenerys getting married during the wedding at Winterfell. The scene was so realistic that I could feel it all—the cold wind, the smell of food, even the nervous excitement in my heart. Then suddenly, I woke up! It felt like a memory or a vision from the future. I know they have to get married eventually, but this was so specific that I started wondering if it was just a dream. Can someone really dream this vividly?   I am so confused right now.  Does anyone else think this is a sign of something bigger happening in the show?    Or maybe it was just a dream... :'(",

If you need support or just someone to talk to, please reach out to a trusted friend, family member, counselor, or therapist. You are not alone! It’s okay to be vulnerable and let others know how you’re feeling.  There are many resources available to help you through this difficult time, such as grief counseling, anger management classes, support groups, etc. Don’t be afraid to use them. And if you need to go back to the past, there are ways to do so—for example, therapy can help you work through things that are causing you to relive those times over and over again.   Most importantly, don’t give up on yourself. Even though it may feel like everything is falling apart, there is hope for the future. Believe in yourself and that you are capable of overcoming any obstacle.  You deserve happiness and peace.",
