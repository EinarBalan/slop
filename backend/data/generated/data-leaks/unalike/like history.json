Not in a literal way, but like it calls to something primal and buried deep within the human heart. Which is odd, since it is entirely fictional and dragons don’t exist.  Many people say that the Handmaid’s Tale is a cautionary tale about the dangers of totalitarianism, misogyny, and religious extremism. Others argue that it’s a commentary on American culture and social dynamics.  Some claim the story mirrors historical events, drawing parallels to the Salem Witch Trials, the Spanish Inquisition, and even Nazi Germany. Considering the lack of diversity portrayed in Gilead, what do you think about the portrayal of black and gay people? Were they systematically eliminated, or do you think they managed to survive and potentially influence the resistance movement? I know that when the takeover started, many people fled continental US, and many people were killed. What of those left, what’s the population?  It’s just fascinating to think about how the story resonates with so many different interpretations and anxieties.",

Separated into the two syllables \"Shire\" and \"Reen\" the name can be read as \"Bright-Reborn\" using Old English (which George very commonly uses) and French.  >Shere or Shire is derived from the Old English \"scir\", meaning  \"fair, bright, shining\" .  >René meaning  born again or reborn  in French is derived from the Latin name Renatus.  Why think French? Because the name Shireen or \"Shereen\" is also a French name from the word \"chéri\"  (Listen to Google translate French to English say chéri. The pronunciation is almost exactly the same) .  Additionally, it's also a name from the old French kingdom of Béarn.   This reading of the name very closely matches the language used when a follower of R'llor discusses fire sacrifice or death.  >\"Let these girls be reborn in light. - Victarion  >Better that they be reborn into the light.\" - Selyse   The name \"Shireen\" is a play on words.

    "self_text": "I’m consistently getting relatively slow Wi-Fi speeds – around 20-30 Mbps download, even though I’m supposed to be getting 100 Mbps. I’ve rebooted my router and modem numerous times, and I’ve run speed tests on different devices. I've also ensured I'm not running bandwidth-intensive applications simultaneously. I’m located in a fairly rural area, so the distance to the provider’s equipment is significant. I'm looking for practical, affordable solutions. Any recommendations for improving my Wi-Fi speed would be greatly appreciated!",

I've heard many reports that people had previously been able to trade in the P3 (or even p2) for a free Pixel 7, and now that doesn’t seem to be the case. The best Verizon promo I can seem to find is $400 via 36 months of promo credit (ick) - 24 months is no longer an option. Any advice?",

    "self_text": "Asallam alaikum everyone, I'm a revert living with my family, including sister, her boyfriend and their son, my nephew. I only speak what is necessary to my nephew's father and never greet him with hello or good morning. I never stay in same room with him alone but when I buy food for the house, it for everyone so he feels he wants to do the same. Can I accept halal food from him? Can I borrow some of his protein powder because I’ve been training really hard and muscles sore and need some food ! Or would that make me a hypocrite? Jazak'Allah kheiran for reading from me",
