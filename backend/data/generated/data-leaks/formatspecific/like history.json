    "self_text": "I (20M) have always had a strong, deep attachment to watching cartoons, but I also simultaneously CANNOT get the same appeal from live-action shows. The problem with live-action, at least for me, is that for whatever reason I can’t follow live-action stories in the same way I can with animated ones. When I'm watching a cartoon, I can listen to the dialogue and pay attention enough to stay interested in the story pretty easily. With live-action though, especially if it's in a more cinematic/serious tone, I find it harder to keep up with the dialogue and follow the plot, like I'll be watching for 5-10 minutes and I'll barely have any grasp of the characters, setting, plot, etc. It's like it's in another language that I can only sorta half-understand. It'd be one thing if this was some childhood trait, but no, I STILL cannot have the same attachment to live-action as I do to cartoons, even as a full grown man. It's not like I don't watch live-action stuff at all mind you, in fact I do like a lot of live-action shows and movies. But most of the live-action stuff I watch is like trendy/pop culture series and franchises. Stuff like Harry Potter, the MCU, 90s sitcoms like Fresh Prince, basically popular franchises and brands. My live-action selection also tends to be more comedy and action focused; serious, dramatic live-action shows are THE WORST for me. I can sorta follow an action movie or a sitcom, but you'll lose me completely if you try to show me a crime drama, soap opera, or Oscar bait movie. I've heard that being heavily into cartoons as a grown adult is common among autistic people (not sure if that's true or just internet trolls calling cartoon fans \"autistic\"), and I myself was diagnosed with Asperger’s at age 3, when symptoms may first show, but because kids outgrow behaviors as they age, you can’t say for sure if you’ve got it until you’re about 6 or 7. My mom never rechecked me when I reached that age, she just rolled with that same diagnosis from when I was 3, and since I’ve outgrown the vast majority of those behaviors and traits I had as a kid, A LOT of people question or flat out refuse to believe the idea that I have autism (even a family friend who worked as an ER nurse back in the 90s). So who knows what could be causing this phenomenon. Anyway, I'm in the process of learning that it’s ok to take a sick day if you’re too sick. I’m in the process of learning that it’s ok to stop your workout if you’re in bad pain. I’m in the process of learning that it’s ok to take the elevator if you hurt your knee.

    "self_text": "my mom called at 1 am yesterday to open the door. They were furious. I asked what was happening and they told me they were trying to contact me since 10 pm. I said I went to bed early as I told them I would probably do and they said I should have sent a message that I was going to bed.  they started yelling at me and I was like wtf, because it wasn't like I sneaked out of the house to go to a party (which they wouldn't say no if I wanted to go to a party in the first place, I wouldn't need to sneak out).  I’m actually confused because I don’t get why they got so angry. I had talked to them an hour prior to me going to bed, but it was like it wasn't enough. I hate when they are on my neck and won’t let me breathe, because it suffocates me. staying alone at night seems like a difficult thing to accept but they knew that I was staying there and they had talked to me before, so I don’t understand where all this distrust comes from. I’ve never broken the rules of the house or snook out, or even lied to them about where I was. and it’s also weird that they make such a big deal about it at this age. I know each parent is different but I’m 18 and this type of behavior is something I’ve never seen in them. it actually disgusted me how much they don’t trust me even when I never made anything for them not to.  also, do they not know me? I usually go to bed early, it’s not uncommon for me to be already asleep at those hours. why do I feel like they don’t even bother to get to know me and expect me to be a certain way?  so AITA? was I really wrong or is it ok to feel suffocated by this behavior?",

Specifically, the slightly melancholy, vaguely orchestral arrangement that accompanies every episode.  I've spent considerable time analyzing its chord progressions, instrumentation, and overall effect on the viewing experience. The melody is deceptively simple, relying heavily on stepwise motion and predictable intervals. The instrumentation – primarily strings and woodwinds – contributes to a feeling of gentle nostalgia and understated elegance. However, the rhythmic structure is oddly jarring, creating a subtle tension that mirrors the competitive atmosphere of the baking challenges. Furthermore, the tempo fluctuates subtly throughout the piece, adding to the overall sense of unease. Ultimately, the theme song is a masterful exercise in calculated dissonance, perfectly capturing the show's blend of warmth and pressure.  It’s both comforting and unsettling, a reflection of the emotional rollercoaster experienced by the contestants.  Do you agree?",

Visual Symptoms:**\n\n*   **Spots & Lesions:** Brown, black, yellow, or reddish spots on leaves, stems, or fruit. The appearance and color can vary depending on the specific disease.\n*   **Wilting:** Leaves drooping despite adequate watering. This could be caused by root rot, vascular wilt diseases, or nutrient deficiencies.\n*   **Yellowing Leaves (Chlorosis):** Yellowing of leaves, often starting with older leaves and progressing upwards. Can be caused by nutrient imbalances (nitrogen deficiency is a common culprit), fungal infections, or viral diseases.\n*   **Leaf Drop:** Excessive shedding of leaves, especially if it occurs rapidly or irregularly.\n*   **Distorted Growth:** Unusual shapes, curled leaves, stunted growth, or asymmetrical development.\n\n**2. Stem & Root Issues:**\n\n*   **Cankers:** Dark, sunken areas on stems – a sign of bacterial or fungal infection.\n*   **Root Rot:** Mushy, brown roots indicating decay due to lack of oxygen or fungal pathogens. Often accompanied by wilting and yellowing.\n*   **Stem Rot:** Soft, decaying sections of the stem.\n\n**3. Pest Infestation:**\n\n*   **Visible Insects:** Obvious pests like aphids, caterpillars, beetles, or mites.\n*   **Sticky Residue (Honeydew):** Sap secreted by sucking insects, attracting ants and promoting fungal growth.\n*   **Damage to Foliage:** Holes, chewed edges, or distorted leaf shapes caused by insect feeding.\n\n**4. Other Indicators:**\n\n*   **Powdery Coating:** A white, powdery substance on leaves – often indicates fungal diseases like powdery mildew.\n*   **Rust Spots:** Orange or reddish-brown pustules on leaves.\n*   **Blackening:** Blackening of flowers or buds.\n\n\n\n**Important Note:** *Accurate identification is crucial.*  Take clear pictures of the affected areas and consult with a local nursery, agricultural extension office, or experienced gardener for proper diagnosis. Trying to treat a disease without knowing its cause can be ineffective and potentially harmful to the plant.",

I was sleepy so I didn’t really understand. I got up and opened the door to see my parents furious. They told me they were trying to contact me since 10 pm. I said I went to bed early as I told them I would probably do and they said I should have sent a message that I was going to bed. They started yelling at me and I was like wtf, because it wasn’t like I sneaked out of the house to go to a party (which they wouldn’t say no if I wanted to go to a party in the first place, I wouldn’t need to sneak out). The whole point why they were angry is because I was sleeping. I’m actually confused because I don’t get why they got so angry. I had talked to them an hour prior to me going to bed, but it was like it wasn’t enough. I hate when they are on my neck and won’t let me breathe, because it suffocates me. Staying alone at night seems like a difficult thing to accept but they knew that I was staying there and they had talked to me before, so I don’t understand where all this distrust comes from. I’ve never broken the rules of the house or snook out, or even lied to them about where I was. And it’s also weird that they make such a big deal about it at this age. I feel like they don’t even bother to get to know me and expect me to be a certain way. So AITA? Was I really wrong or is it ok to feel suffocated by this behavior?",

Dogs are great companions, but they’re a huge commitment – walks, training, vet bills, constant supervision. Plus, the shedding! I just don’t have the time or energy for a dog. Cats are perfectly content entertaining themselves, and they’re much lower maintenance.  I know people love dogs, and that’s fantastic, but for me, cats are the superior pet.",

I'm consistently adding a few seconds to my runs, but I'm stuck.  Any advice on how to overcome this plateau and continue improving? Specifically, I'm looking for tips on identifying inefficiencies in my existing route, optimizing movement techniques, and maintaining consistent execution under pressure.  Are there any specific tools or resources you’d recommend (e.g., save editors, analysis software)?",

    "self_text": "Sunlight is made up of all the colors of the rainbow. When sunlight enters the Earth’s atmosphere, it collides with tiny air molecules. Blue and violet light have shorter wavelengths and are scattered more strongly than other colors. This scattering effect is called Rayleigh scattering. Because blue light is scattered more, it appears to come from all directions in the sky, making it look blue. During sunrise and sunset, the sunlight travels through more of the atmosphere, and blue light is scattered away, leaving the longer wavelengths like orange and red to dominate.",

    "self_text": "I (20M) have always had a strong, deep attachment to watching cartoons, but I also simultaneously CANNOT get the same appeal from live-action shows. The problem with live-action, at least for me, is that for whatever reason I can’t follow live-action stories in the same way I can with animated ones. When I'm watching a cartoon, I can listen to the dialogue and pay attention enough to stay interested in the story pretty easily. With live-action though, especially if it’s in a more cinematic/serious tone, I find it harder to keep up with the dialogue and follow the plot, like I'll be watching for 5-10 minutes and I’ll barely have any grasp of the characters, setting, plot, etc. It's like it's in another language that I can only sorta half-understand. It’d be one thing if this was some childhood trait, but no, I STILL cannot have the same attachment to live-action as I do to cartoons, even as a full grown man. It's not like I don't watch live-action stuff at all mind you, in fact I do like a lot of live-action shows and movies. But most of the live-action stuff I watch is like trendy/pop culture series and franchises. Stuff like Harry Potter, the MCU, 90s sitcoms like Fresh Prince, basically popular franchises and brands. My live-action selection also tends to be more comedy and action focused; serious, dramatic live-action shows are THE WORST for me. I can sorta follow an action movie or a sitcom, but you'll lose me completely if you try to show me a crime drama, soap opera, or Oscar bait movie. I've heard that being heavily into cartoons as a grown adult is common among autistic people (not sure if that's true or just internet trolls calling cartoon fans \"autistic\"), and I myself was diagnosed with Asperger's at age 3, when symptoms may first show, but because kids outgrow behaviors as they age, you can’t say for sure if you’ve got it until you’re about 6 or 7. My mom never rechecked me when I reached that age, she just rolled with that same diagnosis from when I was 3, and since I’ve outgrown the vast majority of those behaviors and traits I had as a kid, A LOT of people question or flat out refuse to believe the idea that I have autism (even a family friend who worked as an ER nurse back in the 90s). So who knows what could be causing this phenomenon. Anyway, I'm at a cross roads and not sure which step would be best. AITA?",
