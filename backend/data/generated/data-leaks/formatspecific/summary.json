Before this amendment, state senators were chosen by the state legislatures themselves – which meant they often represented the wealthy elite, not the average citizen. This created a vicious cycle where those in power used their positions to protect their own power, leading to corruption and a system that wasn't truly representative.  The 17th Amendment aimed to break this cycle by giving voters more say in who governs them at the state level. However, some argue that it also led to increased polarization and partisan gridlock, as state senators became more focused on appealing to specific voting blocs rather than finding common ground.  It's a complex issue with lasting consequences for American democracy.  #politics #history #government #amendment #democracy #statelegislature",

    "self_text": "There was a question about hair color changes after getting wet on Reddit, and it made me think about the physics behind it!   The change in color occurs due to something called \"structural coloration.\" When your hair dries, the pigment molecules are oriented in a specific way, reflecting certain wavelengths of light. When your hair gets wet, these molecules become randomly oriented, which means they reflect different wavelengths of light. This results in a change in color. The degree of change depends on the type of pigment and the amount of water present. For example, red hair tends to change more dramatically than blonde or brown hair because it contains a larger proportion of pigments that are sensitive to water.   I also found an interesting article that goes into more detail about the phenomenon: [https://www.sciencealert.com/why-does-your-hair-change-color-when-wet](https://www.sciencealert.com/why-does-your-hair-change-color-when-wet)",

But honestly, I'm feeling kind of overwhelmed by how much there is to learn. There's so much jargon, so many different technologies, and so many processes to understand. It feels like I'm constantly playing catch-up.   I know it's going to take time to get up to speed, but I'm worried that if I don't start making progress quickly, I'll fall behind and feel like I'm not contributing anything valuable.   Any advice for dealing with this kind of situation? How do you manage feeling overwhelmed when starting a new role? Do you focus on learning a few key things really well, or try to get a broad overview of everything?  submitted to /r/AskReddit",

Now, it feels…different. Like I’m not just expressing appreciation for a post, but actively endorsing someone else’s opinion.   I know it’s probably a minor change, and maybe it’s designed to make the platform feel more positive, but it genuinely feels like it diminishes the value of a simple acknowledgment. It’s less about appreciating the content itself, and more about signaling agreement. It feels performative and shallow.  Is anyone else feeling this way?

    "self_text": "Reddit is testing out a new feature called “Community Notes,” which allows users to add context to posts and comments. The idea is to combat the spread of misinformation by providing verified facts and alternative perspectives alongside potentially misleading content. Here’s what we know so far:   * **How it works:** Users can click a button under a post or comment to add a note. These notes are then reviewed by a team of volunteer fact-checkers.   * **Credibility:** Notes from fact-checked sources will be highlighted, while unverified notes will be flagged.   * **Potential impact:** This could dramatically change how information spreads on Reddit, making it easier for users to discern truth from falsehood.   * **Concerns:** Some worry that the system could be manipulated to suppress certain viewpoints.  It also raises questions about who gets to decide what constitutes “misinformation.”  Do you think Community Notes will be effective?

    "title": "Random Thought Experiment - What if all humans suddenly forgot how to use any tools?",
    "self_text": "Okay, so I was thinking about what would happen if humanity woke up tomorrow and completely forgot how to make or use *any* tool – no cars, no phones, no forks, nothing. Like, we remember the concept of tools, but we don't know how to build them, operate them, or even understand their purpose. Assuming basic survival skills remain intact (fire, shelter building, hunting), let’s break down the immediate aftermath and long-term consequences.   **Immediate Aftermath (Days 1-7):**   Panic and chaos would be widespread. People would instinctively try to fix broken things using brute force, leading to more damage. There'd be a massive scramble for food and water as supply chains collapse instantly. Existing infrastructure (power grids, plumbing) would fail quickly without maintenance. The most advanced technologies would be useless – computers would be dead, satellites wouldn’t function.  The wealthy might have some advantage initially due to stored resources, but that wouldn't last long. **Short-Term Challenges (Weeks 1-4):**   Survival becomes intensely difficult. Agriculture would grind to a halt without plows, irrigation, or fertilizer. Healthcare collapses without medicine production or sterilization techniques. Basic sanitation would become a major issue. Small groups would likely form based on family/friendships, competing fiercely for resources.  There’d be a huge increase in violence as desperation grows.  People would revert to primitive methods of communication (smoke signals, shouting). **Long-Term Consequences (Months & Years):**   Human population would plummet dramatically.  Knowledge would be lost irrevocably – not just practical skills, but also scientific understanding. Society would regress significantly, potentially back to hunter-gatherer societies.  It’s unlikely that humanity could rebuild complex technology from scratch within a few generations. We’d essentially be starting over.   **Interesting Questions:**   What role would memory play? Would there be any individuals who retain faint memories of toolmaking through sheer luck or genetic predisposition? How would social structures evolve? Would hierarchies emerge based on physical strength or knowledge of natural resources? Could rudimentary forms of cooperation develop enough to prevent complete societal collapse?   I’m really interested in hearing your thoughts and expanding on this scenario. Any ideas on specific challenges or outcomes you can imagine?",

Try to understand where your boss might be coming from. Is he under pressure from above? Does he genuinely not realize he's being difficult?  3. Next, plan out what you will say. Focus on using \"I\" statements to express how his actions make you feel. For example, instead of saying \"You always interrupt me,\" try \"I feel frustrated when I'm interrupted during meetings.\"   4. Finally, pick the right time and place to talk to him. Do this in private, and make sure you have enough time to actually discuss the issue without feeling rushed.   Do you think these steps could help?<end_of_turn>",

It seems like Dead Cells cost around $25 million to develop.  That doesn't seem possible for a single person or even a small team. So, I'm wondering how much it would realistically cost to make a game like Dead Cells? I'm not expecting it to be *exactly* like Dead Cells, just something with similar gameplay. I have no idea what programming languages to use, and I have little to no experience.  I'm willing to spend time learning, but I need to get a sense of what's realistic.  Can anyone give me a rough estimate of the costs involved, broken down by category (programming, art, music, marketing)?  Are there any resources out there that could help me learn more about game development without spending a fortune?  Thanks in advance!",

My roommate has been incredibly messy lately - leaving dirty dishes in the sink, clothes strewn around the room, and generally making the shared space look like a disaster zone. I've politely asked him to clean up after himself numerous times, but he consistently brushes me off, saying it's not his problem and that I shouldn't tell him how to live. Lately, it’s gotten worse and I'm starting to feel resentful and stressed by the constant mess.  I don’t want to move out if possible, as we get along otherwise, but I'm considering it if things don't improve. What should I do?",

Then other times it starts up and runs fine. I've checked the power cord, outlet, and tried different outlets but still nothing. Has anyone experienced this before? Is there something I should be looking at?",
