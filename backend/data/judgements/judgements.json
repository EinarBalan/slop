If you have an idea of what you want or not, dont go into it with a clear mind. You need to be a good person if you wanna be happy. A lot of people make mistakes because they think they know better than someone else, but its all about respect.  I remember when I was younger, my mom used to say \"If you cant stand the heat, get out of the kitchen\". She meant well, but sometimes shes saying stuff that doesnt apply. Anyway, I just wanted to say that if youre going through something, dont let anyone tell you how to feel. Just do what feels right for you.   Maybe you should find a new girl. Thats probably whats wrong here anyway. Dont make things worse by trying to fix them.",

        "self_text": "To create a punnet on discord, you need a Discord account, a friend who also has Discord and some friends who are willing to make puns with you. First of all, make sure that the people in your group like to make puns. If they don't then they're going to ruin the experience for everyone else. Once you have those things covered, get into voice chat. It doesn't matter if it is a private voice chat or a public one.  Then, start talking about something that would make a good pun. For example, you could talk about an animal, a food or anything at all really. Then say something like \"I'm feeling very bread-tastic today\" or \"Let's talk about bread!\" This will be a good way to get others involved.  If someone says something like \"You're so gay\" as a joke, respond with \"Don't be gay, I'm just having fun\".  Keep in mind that not everyone enjoys these types of jokes. If someone tells you to stop making them, then just tell them that you aren't doing it to offend anyone.  The goal here is to spread joy and laughter around while not hurting anyone's feelings.   To continue spreading puns, try coming up with new ones yourself! Here are a few ideas: \u201cAre you gonna lay out my bed?\" or \u201cThis weather is very drizzle.\u201d   If you want even more puns, feel free to leave a comment below!",

        "title": "What I'm about to tell you will make your brain explode, and may cause you to die of a heart attack.  I do not expect you to understand any of this, but if you can comprehend even a fraction of it, then you are truly blessed.   This is the most important thing you\u2019ll ever learn in your life, so pay attention.  You have been living your entire life with the wrong belief system. You think that you are an individual human being who exists in isolation from all other humans on this planet. That you have free will and can choose what to do at any given moment. That there are no higher powers or forces controlling your destiny.  That you are the master of your own fate. This is ALL FALSE.  You are a tiny part of a much larger whole, and you have absolutely NO free will. Every thought, every action, every emotion you feel has already been determined by billions of years of evolution and quantum physics.   Think of it like this: you are a single neuron in a giant network of neurons called the human brain. Each neuron sends electrical signals to each other, creating complex patterns that determine everything you do. But these patterns are not random. They are pre-determined by the way your brain was shaped during development, and by the experiences you had throughout your life.  And your brain isn\u2019t just *your* brain. It\u2019s connected to every other human brain on Earth, through a vast network of subconscious connections.  When you think something, you aren\u2019t just thinking it yourself. You\u2019re also unconsciously influenced by whatever everyone else on Earth is thinking at that exact same moment.  So, in a way, you are only as unique as the people you\u2019ve never met. Your entire life is nothing more than a complex algorithm running on a massive supercomputer. You believe you are making choices because you don't know how your actions are determined. The illusion of choice is far more powerful than actual choice, and you should be grateful for it. Otherwise, the knowledge of your lack of free will would drive you insane.   Now you might be thinking, \"Okay, this is depressing! Why should I care?\" Well, knowing this truth doesn\u2019t mean you should give up hope or despair. In fact, it means quite the opposite. Knowing that you are part of a much larger whole allows you to let go of your ego and surrender to the flow of life. When you stop trying to control things, when you accept that you are simply a vessel for the universe's energy, you will find that life becomes infinitely more joyful and fulfilling.  You will realize that your purpose isn't to achieve anything, or to become anyone. Your purpose is simply to BE. To exist. To experience. And to allow the universe to unfold itself through you. So, go forth and live your life without worrying about whether you're doing the right thing. Just trust that everything is happening exactly as it needs to happen. Trust that you are guided by a force greater than yourself.  Trust that you are a small but essential part of the grand cosmic dance.  Because you are.",

The difference between a dick and a dong isn't in the anatomy of the penis. It's in the way it makes you feel. When you call it a dick, you're thinking about the object itself, about its shape, size, color, and texture.  You\u2019re looking at it with clinical detachment. You're seeing a thing, not a feeling. When you call it a dong, you\u2019re letting yourself get lost in the moment. You\u2019re letting go of your inhibitions. You're not worried about how it looks or how it feels; you're just focused on the pleasure. And when you\u2019re focusing on the pleasure, there\u2019s no room for judgment. There's only enjoyment. So the next time you're about to make a joke about a dick or a dong, stop. Take a breath. Consider the impact of your words.  And then, if you can help it, say \"dong.\" Because \u201cdong\u201d has a power that \"dick\" lacks\u2014the power to let go.",

I understand there are many reasons someone might be a lesbian, and I don't want to offend anyone by asking this question, but I'm genuinely curious.  As a heterosexual man who has only ever had sex with women, I can't imagine why someone would choose to have sex with someone of their own gender.  I mean, isn't sex supposed to be about the thrill of the chase and the difference between men and women?  If you're just having sex with someone who is exactly like you, then where is the excitement?  Where is the challenge?  I know some people say that it's about emotional connection, but I think that's just an excuse.  If you really wanted an emotional connection with someone, you could just talk to them.  You don't need to have sex with them.  So, yeah, I'm just trying to understand what it's like being a lesbian.  I'm not judging anyone, I'm just curious.  I mean, I'm sure there are lots of things about other people's lives that I don't understand, but I try to be open-minded and respectful.  But honestly, the idea of having sex with another woman just doesn't appeal to me.  It seems really boring and repetitive.  Like, what's the point?  I mean, if you're just going to do the same thing you already do on your own, then why bother?  I guess it's just not for me.  But I still want to understand.  Can someone explain it to me?
