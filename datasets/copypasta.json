    "self_text": "You don't have shit personnel? You lose space and wind. They have no silly expression of pigeons, shy humanity and each life is perfect. Its cause is not currently married that 100 years in the future will be used as a solution to a bad problem. Do you want everyone to participate in their deepest or not entity, cannot be maintained more quickly. If Jesus dies of our sins, he should not see the insults we have done, because if he did, he prevents himself from being a person, so he is not true. After his death, his bones appear according to scientific research. In all generations in the future, you may know that you create your bone training because small information can be like waste surface and social responsibility, it is not surprising that your father really asked the boy Because it is not money, it should be a carbon that has a problem with you as a family member. His birth strengthens humanity in all respects how he can think and make people express in the event of an organization. Everything is generally an incredible spoon which is an unknown base. You can only seek evil. I can say that the apocalypse is dad, but these are the words closest to the people who are afraid at the time. He criticizes all those who love and know the eternal situation of suffering. So you arrive on the radio to a sacred place or a sacred place, a hundred or a human place.Are you repaired? He is an intelligent shaman, dumimoss nor and nobody likes no one. Road Island is better if you do not join us. It is a little fragile of a liar and hates it in any part. We do not even expect the personality and the poet of this beautiful wool of all ages explain the scale when it is dry and how much it is. Anyone who creates in religion without realizing that it is always false because when holy organizations do not allow the world and the universe. In the future, there will be their terrible terrible problems and their horrible aspects, that students must know that a monster that is not really designed has occurred in the same country of the terrible horrible events of the film. They are the perfect idea of ​​everything that does not go in this world. But he can do it to do a little part of the evil. It is not yet disgusting in human history, but this place is hard to believe that I see this failure in my eyes. But I'm here, so it's a shame that I can't deny your appearance. Even if I do my best, my vocabulary cannot explain the size of the idiot. Whatever time, one day, there was a spirit that it was decided to come back well before history, because it should include a very bad example of a daring spirit in history. I don't think her mother heard him last about nine months.Then you made a lonely animal like you. Unusually unknown. The world of the world should not create a policy to avoid bad events at the moment of this possible moment. When I saw you for the first time, I know that all the bad are completely disgusting. I hope to prevent your fault from marking this world and keep your eyes on the next one. He was the worst person or even a very ordinary person who testified. Events such as infected diseases must clearly learn the personality of the newly created festival. But while a good experimentation of humanity can do a person for an inevitable illegal act if you have your child, you will kill him to prevent him from protecting him from his blood advice unless someone can get a hundred miles . You are your only father. But despite their ancestors, and despite all the blood, disgusting, their newly made mistake was worse than all those who immediately heard.And their bodies are no longer in their mistakes in the case of materialism, we do not survive the size of the world. But we can reach the distance on the well known side and almost the unknown universe. I can stay here to write a class that does not have a letter that describes its greatest failure. But I give my life to explain that my heart stopped so hard that the world has just started. It is an indifferent image that does not respond, the earth, the disgust, the evil, the evil, the evil, the life is the slightest painting of history. Complexity, I have the feeling that you can do for you and your illegal actions. I don't think I can see a good feeling to understand my feelings. When Colombia was forbidden in Malghen, many soldiers fought and died with their children who had the best opportunities for children, they did not live their fate. It is true that technology is evolving and the lesson is more precise. I don't think Ubunu understands what it means for the universe. My anger about you and more deeply that the deeper Shambawa tends to overcome whenever your lungs go there and return to my anger.What are the insults so strong that all the mountains of the United Nations are full of evidence that if honesty cannot believe my anger? There are no relatives in the world, and especially after the last world, nobody loves them in the future. There is no hope that your continuous behavior, and in particular rotating spirits, can change better and vice versa can be achieved. Thanks to the new error, he showed that he hoped that he could devote himself to a larger person. The only way to shine instead of a small black hole in the future is not undeniable that it cannot belong to its current failure.",

When I was homeless on Toronto he found me begging for change on the street, but instead of passing me by like everyone else he took the time to ask how I was doing and how I ended up in my situation. I told him everything and we cried together, suddenly he took my hand and said \"come with me, kid\". I had nothing to lose so I went with him. He brought me to his hotel, cleaned me up, bought me some new clothes, helped me write a resume and even offered to act as a reference. As if that wasn't enough already, he gave me a thousand dollars in cash as I was leaving. I can't thank him enough, he's the reason I went from a suicidal street person to a father of three beautiful daughters.    Source: comment section at   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLJfT4IZqPs",

    "self_text": "According to Weforum.com, there have been a total of 117 billion people in human history. The ratio of men to women has been consistently about 1:1 so we can assume there have been around 585 billion men since the start of humanity. The average time that it takes to complete a blowjob has been found to be 9 minutes and 30 seconds. The amount of men who have non functional penises is negligible, so it will not be taken into account for our calculations. if we were to convert 9 minutes and 30 seconds to 570 seconds,  and multiply this by 585 billion, we'd get 333,450,000,000,000 seconds, this converts to 922,50,00,000 hours, 10,573,630 years, and 105,736 centuries. The average human life spans for 70.6 years. meaning it would take 149,768 people who are  selflessly goblin glizzy from birth to death in order to get every dick in human history sucked. If YOU had bravely stepped up in the name of this cause when you were born, you could have sucked a total of 0.0007% of gods given glizzys by the time you died.

    "self_text": "Whenever I get a package of plain M&Ms, I make it my duty to continue the strength and robustness of the candy as a species. To this end, I hold M&M duels. Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the “loser,” and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment. When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3×5 card reading, “Please use this M&M for breeding purposes.” This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&Ms. I consider this “grant money.” I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament. From a field of hundreds, we will discover the True Champion. There can be only one.",

They have already tried tear gas but I vape so much that the molecules just bounced off my glycerol and poorly understood synthetic chinese flavour chemical coated alveoli, reflected off my popcorn lung pustules, and were expelled into the air where they were immediately re-inhaled by my dual Belle Delphine Bathwater and air cooled my little pony themed PC, further adding to the almost 1 inch thick layer of caked on hair and dust from scratching my neckbeard held together by baja blast flavored vape juice resin.   I'm going to take my fedora off now.

M'lady,   I'll be honest,  I approach all posts on this website from an inherently cynical angle. Rather than trying to build or contribute in any way, my main aim in replying is simply to make myself feel better, and if I've done a particularly thorough job, which I have been known to do, make you feel a little worse about yourself. The synapses in my large brain look as crusty and deflated as the socks on my floor. I have spent a lifetime  rinsing my entire being  in the most extreme instantly gratifying, by design addictive, loud, high colour, sped up, supersaturated, unrealistic, dopamine, serotonin, and even oxytocin intensive media known to man, with devices that most of the individuals of my species who have ever lived would surely assert is indistinguishable from god like magic.   I have seen and felt everything. I have seen more women than all the great conquerors of the world combined, every night I dine on food that would cause a Victorian era peasant to literally cry, I posses an array of devices created in laboratories that have allowed me to enjoy more physical pleasure than 99.999% of all the people on the planet, I have enjoyed a cocktail of grey market designer drugs shipped to my door the likes of which Adolf Hitler, or Michael Jackson, with full time chemists who's ability to  provide for their fucking families , hinged on their ability to get their masters as loaded as humanly possible without falling asleep or dying, could only dream of. And despite all of this, despite the apparent unhealthiness of my lifestyle, I have already lived a longer life than most of my ancestors, and whether you like it or not I will continue living for much longer than I have any right to.   I am telling you all this because I want you to know that it all pales in comparison to the pleasure that I derive from tearing your hopes and ideas down.   Toodaloo,  XXX_xxx.chillosopher.xxx_XXX",

The last 3 times I've gone to get spaghetti noodles they've been sold out of just spaghetti noddles. They have thick spaghetti, thin spaghetti, veggie spaghetti, gluten free spaghetti, whole grain spaghetti, but no plain jane run of the mill spaghetti. What the fuck has happened the last 5 years to create so many bullshitty versions of a simple pasta?! And why the FUCK do stores not realize they're perpetually out of just spaghetti when the spot is always fucking empty but the veggie spaghetti stays put? NO THAT MANY PEOPLE WANT VEGGIE SPAGHETTI!  FUCK   Again, very sorry OP",

I want to suckle at his motherly bosom, slurping that rich juche milk from his teat as he gently strokes my raging erection. I would stir his velvety cream into my coffee and let my balls boil in it. His cries of pleasure and the rocking of our bed would be louder than the cacophony of ten thousand drone strikes. I would make love to him until my body gave out, and then some.

    "self_text": "I’m posting this again because I can. Its been bothering me it was removed. I believe legitimate dialogue on any and every topic should be permissible ~  I recently familiarized myself with Andrew Tate.. Prior to this I had listened to him zero. I tend to ignore internet fads or over sensationalization as much as I can to protect my own mind. All I had heard about him was he was a misogynist and an evil scumbag. Never would I have expected what I actually found.  He was not the monster they claimed. Nothing like what people said he was. I did not expect such an articulate and intelligent individual and it became immediately obvious to me, upon listening to his core messages, why he was banned on every single social media platform in one single, coordinated assault. Within 24 hours, the individual more googled than Trump, Biden, or Putin, was locked out of nearly every app on his phone and journalists from every corner of the state, aimed their talons at him spreading lies and misinformation typical to our times.  Andrew Tate, as much as many would not like it to be so, is a great man. He is not a perfect man, he is definitely a narcissist, but I find this to be a common trait in winners, and in all of us deep down. Regardless of that, he is also surprisingly a kind man and a good man. Since investigating him, I've listened to nearly 24 full hours of long form discussion from him.  Anybody who actually listens to him, would quickly discover, he is worth listening to, the liars are not.",

Either way, this stuff is pretty dang good! When you make your own strawberry freezer jam you get to control exactly how much sugar goes into it. It’s also an amazing way to preserve strawberries when they are at their prime (and cheapest). And like I mentioned above, this recipe doesn’t require any cooking so you won’t have to heat up your kitchen in the middle of summer. Win-win! This strawberry freezer jam has been my go-to for many years now and we always seem to come back to it year after year when strawberries are in season. There are some other recipes out there but most call for adding a box of fruit pectin which just drives up the cost a bit too much for me. This homemade version uses only 1/2 cup of sugar per pound of strawberries so you don’t need anything else (except maybe some jars with lids). If you want your strawberry jam",

    "title": "Reddit, AITA (Am I The Asshole) for destroying 4 new GT sedans because they had bright blue laser headlights? (The spoilers tag is because the GT sedans had spoilers on them.)",
    "self_text": "Hello reddit. To preface this I would like to say that I am in highschool and have gotten my learner's permit very recently. After I got my permit I was issued my federally-standardized silver (I could have chosen green instead but I was worried that it would blend in with my lawn when I parked it) 1990s sedan with black hubcaps and authentic rust trim. In order to obtain my license (you need a license in order to cut off the muffler) I had to drive for 100 hours with the stereo at maximum volume playing earthquake sound effects. All great drivers need to be able to focus on the road no matter how loud the driving environment may be.  69 out of 100 hours into my learning experience, I found myself cruising down the interstate at 67 mph (speed limit 65). It was night time and although I had been awake for 69 hours (all great drivers need to be able to focus on the road no matter how long they have been in the driving environment) straight the earthquake sound effects blasted on the shittiest (but most boosted) stereo of all time guaranteed that everyone in the zip code would be wide awake.  Then disaster struck.  Evidently my learning experience irritated a group of local drivers. But these weren't just any drivers. These were drivers with moderately wealthy parents. These drivers were equipped with the latest in GT trim sedan technology. I could tell because of the exhaust noise that shook my very being. Were they coming to kick me off of their turf? Did they intend to challenge my beat up corolla to a test of speed? Normally my corolla would never stand a chance. But I was a great driver. All great drivers can get the most out of their car. My corolla would be wielded as a weapon, fighting on the side of student drivers everywhere. I would easily defeat them and be able to finish my 31 hours. I was a great driver. A great driver can accomplish anything.  But my life was about to change forever.  1 blue light appeared on the horizon. Conquest. 2 blue lights. War. 3 blue lights. Famine. 4 blue lights. Death. The four carmen of the apocalypse. The lights grew more intense. It was as if a cluster of blue hypergiants had somehow descended upon our fragile Earth. I almost flinched. I almost looked away. All great drivers need to be able to focus on the road no matter how bright the headlights in front of them may be. I was a great driver. I looked forward, unblinking, unfazed. The  lights grew more intense. Every cell in my body screamed in agony. No cells in my eyes looked away. Therefore, every cell in my body was part of a great driver.   The drivers turned on their high beams.  The lights grew more intense.  The agony stopped.  All great drivers always focus on the road no matter what the conditions may be.  I was focused on the road.  I was a great driver.  I was the greatest driver.  I am the greatest driver.  I am always focused on the road, no matter what the conditions may be.  A voice echoed through the blue-white void of purgatory.  At first I thought that it was God himself, come to collect my worn-out soul.  As the voice came more into focus, I instantly recognized it as someone far greater.  It was Kiichiro Toyoda.  Of course I would recognize such a voice. I was in AP (advanced placement) history. The voices of every historical figure were a fixture of my adolescent existence. And as a corolla driver? Every sound that came out of Toyoda's mouth over the course of his entire life may as well have been etched into the sides of my hippocampus.  \"You have been chosen.\"  Me? For what?  \"You are the driver. You are the greatest driver.\"  Me? The greatest driver? A teenage boy lost in a cruel world with only a corolla that was older than his mortal body? The very man behind the iconic AE86, the invincible Hilux, the techno-miracle of the Prius? Even the legendary Toyota SUPRA MK4? He considered me the greatest driver?  \"Toyota has stood for one thing only since the moment it was founded. Reliability. Toyota is a symbol of Japan more quintessential than the sun itself. After the Americans defeated our nation in the jungles of the Pacific, we constructed the Hilux, a war chariot forged from the souls of the entire nation. It took two decades, but that machine defeated the entirety of western civilization in the sands of the middle east. When the Europeans became too confident in their ability to define automotive speed, we developed the Supra Mk4, an automobile that redefined the very limits of two door coupes. Countless eternities into the future, when every other particle in the universe has been extinguished, an asteroid of Land Cruisers will be all that remains, and all that ever will be.\"  \"You were instructed that a great driver needs to focus on the road at all times. This is true. This is the very heart and core of the concept of being a great driver. But the final, deepest layer is simply reliability. A great driver is reliable. Most drivers recognize this at some point, but lack the integrity, the will, the discipline, to act on this truth.\"  \"Not you. Other \"drivers\" would be deafened by the noise of shitty bass boosted music. Other \"drivers\" would collapse from fatigue while trying to complete their 100 hours. Other \"drivers\" would look away from the supernatural glow of modern laser headlights. Simply put, other \"drivers\" don't even deserve to be called such, and only are out of want for a better word. They are certainly not \"great drivers\".\"   \"You stayed firm in your belief of the Toyota principle of reliability. You are the only one worthy to drive a corolla. You are the only one worthy to operate any automobile, period. Henceforth, you have my blessing. That whenever you operate your rusty silver corolla, you will be unfazed. That whenever you take to the roads, only you will choose when you leave them.\"  \"You drive.\"  The voice faded away. But so too did the light. I felt my foot hit the gas pedal. I focused on the road, and located the first GT sedan, cocksure that their laser beams and sonic weaponry were enough to defeat the greatest driver of all time, the only driver that there ever really was.  I drove.  God I fucking hate those bright ass laser headlights all new sporty cars have.",

Why is casualization of video games seen as an automatic plus in your eyes? If they added a button to allow people to reach 137 Laff Points and maxed gags instantly because some people have less time to play the game, would that be reasonable in your eyes? Disregard the environmental changes; it fundamentally changes the feel of the game that I played back in 2003 when I was 8 years old. I still occasionally revisit the game for nostalgia purposes, and grind a toon up to 100 or so Laff. Toontown Rewritten has progressively become a worse and worse option for those of us who want to enjoy the game we played during our childhoods, because it no longer is that game.",

Now I'm sitting in my office chair and trying not to gag. I'm not squeamish, especially not with my own farts. This is different. Too many onions.  My whole apartment smells like a cross between an outhouse and a paper mill with a dash of rotten egg and diarrhea sprinkles. Why did I do this to myself?? I was a fool. Nay, I am a fool. I don't even want to think about the torrent of ass lava that I'll be subjected to tomorrow morning. I'm going to have animal control at my door thinking a family of possums died in the vents. How will I be able to tell my girlfriend that I can't come see her because I have putrid onion gas? This is a lamentable misstep on my part, I ate God's ass apple and now I'm paying the poo poo price. Too many onions.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: As predicted, I did a world-ending dump that left my legs trembling and gave me what I can only describe as \"the schwetts\" (shit sweats). It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that the malignant stench my shit left is clinging to the walls like cigar smoke, except the cigar is just a turd. I was naive enough to leave my hand towel in the bathroom while I did the dark deed and it will now need to be burned, it absorbed the ass fumes like a greedy little sponge. Evacuating this demon crap from my body tired me out to the point of needing a nap afterwards. I'll be getting in touch with a local priest in hopes of getting my shitter blessed. I looked into the eyes of god and found only poo. Hell is real and it can be purchased for about $1.25 per pound.",

Therapy really helps fix a hateful mindset, I know from experience, it fixed a lot of my relationships.

    "self_text": "From u/Kaasurai-tm  Why are (majority) of you girls like this : teenagers (reddit.com)   &#x200B;  So, just like every other \"teen\" on this sub, most of us have feelings for the opposite gender, or just feelings overall, including me. I'm just an average freshman, not gonna go too in-depth on my physical appearance or anything, but I think I'm decently attractive to some extent, and have a more vibey and chill personality. So, here's where the title comes to it's meaning. Around half of the kids in 9th/freshman year have a lover, and that increases each grade. Most of those couples are either some edgar tall guy who doesn't give a shit about their girl, or an emo couple that spends most of break period making out in the hallway. The rest of freshman couples, idek. Me myself, are neither of those. All I've wanted since like 7th grade was a romantic relationship. Someone to stay up late with and talk to. Someone to laugh with. Not some slutty girl who only likes a certain type of guy. (no offence) Though it seems that most of the girls in my grade, and many grades below that, are just that type. There are a few sweet girls who I'm friends with, but I don't see any possibilities with them. The rest of the slutty girls just like to pick on me about this and that, \"ew, there's that boy\" \"don't touch me!! ughhhh!\" Again, I just wish I had someone. I have plenty of guy friends and we just like to joke around and chill, but I want someone I can love. Someone who can love ME. But obviously my relationships aren't going anywhere near that direction. I'm just some 14 year old dude who's neutral on sports and neutral on all the shit slutty girls find hot in a guy. I'm much of an introvert, and can't even think about asking anyone out. Not that I have a crush anyway. Anyways, I'm sure you girls will mature someday, or is this just what \"my\" generation has came to be?",

Each dick is a silicone, all-weather, nigh-indestructible 1:1 scale replica of the dick belonging to many different people I know. Oh course, I spared no expense when it comes to the detail and accuracy of these phallic measuring sticks, hiring a few Academy Award winning special effects artists to ensure every vein, freckle, lump, scrunch, wrinkle, hair, blemish, mole is exactly where it needs to be. I've even gone as far as to make sure the silicone versions of my friends' penises even have the right musk wafting from them. They surely are a sight to be admired and respected.  Were it your penis out there, standing monolithic in the beautiful purples and oranges of a setting winter sun as the snowfall begins, I dare say there would be a voodoo like effect in your loins. No doubt, your balls would clench and retract reflexively even though your own actual penis is snug in your long johns, perhaps even a bit sweaty because my home is kept toastier than most.  And when that snowfall does begin, I'll stand at my window and watch my friends be buried one by one. \"Ahh, it's already snowed a Jay-full! It was to the tip of Jesse last night! We got a half-shaft of Josh on the ground today!\" I call up my friends, shivering in the groin as they are, and inform them how buried their cocks are in the old man winter's excessive dandruff. They only beg me to remove the measuring cock from my patio, that their flesh sears with the frigid clutch of frostbite, that the pain is unbearable.  Such goofs!  Jay begs that I just destroy his cock as a particularly heavy snow just crests his tip and covers his urethra. No, I won't do it. I won't remove my beloved measuring cocks. They're much too lovely and informative. I have only a dozen or so out there, so there's always room for more accuracy, more fidelity, a more exact way to describe the amount of snow.  As for my own cock replica? Oh yes, it sits there proudly among the others, but I embrace the chill. I see the benefits of an icy cock, and the snow always covers mine.",

Not only are they in the exploitive field, which is mostly comprised of class systems, Capitalism has an average anal penetration of 9 inches, this means they’re large enough to penetrate all proletariat, and with their impressive Base Stats for inflation and access to false class conscious it can be rough with the worker. Due to their mostly exploitation based biology, there’s no doubt in my mind that an aroused Capitalist would be incredibly exploitative, so exploitive that you could easily have them steal surplus values from the proletariat for centuries without anything class conscious forming. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Fascism, along with not having a state to protect the workers, so it’d be incredibly easy for one to exploit you. With their abilities Wage Absorb and Imperialism, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough 3rd world countries and minority communities. No other Economic system comes close to this level of anal penetration of minorities. Also, fun fact, if you try to fight it, you will be absorbed by it, as capitalism absorbs all which makes profits, even those that attempt to criticise it. Capitalism is literally built for proletariat penetration. Ungodly defense stat+high wealth concentration+Imperialism means it can take surplus value all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more.",

    "self_text": "Hog Rider map now opens in Spill Valley (Arena 5). This tool is fast, efficient and very accurate. Family conflict is like any other problem. Hag Ryder, a man with a white beard and a scar on his left ear, collects 4 elixir boxes.  Main course.  The speed of the rifle is the same as the ball. Goblins only have one life, so they can eat skin. Many small boats brought pigs to feed and amuse the enemy.  Pigs and other animals grapple with dirt and debris. Despite their power, demons can be defeated if they do not have time to defend themselves.  The player can play Hook Rider 2. However, if you place an object in front of the simulator, the white ball will hit the hawk and return the card.  Hackers and hackers are more dangerous than you think. But progress is the measure of success. The injury usually affects the legs and feet. But this weapon could not withstand the force of the attack and the weight of the snow.  However, this method is suitable for design. It was clear that the soldiers were tearing down buildings and building up enemies.  Stress can damage cells. But old enemies. Therefore, players should use Hog Rider + Snow to attack more support units or increase late game damage.  Send the pigs to destroy the wrong house. This makes it very difficult to visit the Taj Burj when the building is empty. I hope to increase your physical and mental strength. Many Pig's Legs Tor del Rey: The good postman disappeared, but was freed after the death of two kings. This is a good time to use the magic card.  Hog Rider is a multiplayer card game. The paper moves slowly from bottom to top.  In order to protect the health of the pigs, houses and fields, vineyards and barns are said to be destroyed.  Since the Shark Rider house is centrally located, you can see the interior and floor plan of the house without disturbing other houses.  A house with furniture and storage is better than one with a roof. Most pigs are not allowed to enter the house 3 kilometers from the river.  A strong house is smaller than a weak house, so you choose the right and left sides of the lake because our strong house is on a hostile river. It is in a small box.  If a player has a building in the middle of the field and an enemy tries to get to the pig on the edge of the field, dust and wind will destroy the building. He died young. This technique takes practice to get results, so you have to be at the right time.  Mountains and horses.  Collect bones, monsters, planes, dogs, puppies, wolves, kids, lava... All the kids are on the left side of the tree, in the yard and on the right side.  Such an effect can be achieved by cosmic forces. When she stops, she blows.  Select the following four check boxes. The red house runs fast and can handle small attacks quickly and accurately. Continue across the bridge to avoid getting caught. He approached her and held the stage, but she closed her eyes. Traffic Stop This is useful if the player wants to reduce stop damage. Another swimming pool is also available.  A real car will cross the paths of other players and protect pets without any problems. It reduces the princess tower's damage but triples the damage, quickly reacts to the king's tower health and triples the danger. The best way is to put it on a wooden stick.  A powerful team of Eagle, Knight and Flair is called Triple Strike. Falcon Valkyrie protects Chakra and heals him from accidental damage, and Chakra uses the energy to destroy Eagle Chakra.  Knights can attack Valkyrie and Panther bursts and deal damage. Friends are good, but enemies can kill heroes.  Valkyrie's tailwind helps stabilize the aircraft and protect passengers.  A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.  Pairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage. If executed properly, the Hog Rider will act as a tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage. The Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the combo. However, this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air cards as neither of the troops target anything but buildings. Additionally, they are easy to separate, due to the disparity in move speeds. Alternatively, the Hog Rider and the Balloon can be played in different lanes to spread the opponent's defenses thin. However, a building or Tornado can bring them back together for an easier defense.  The Hog Rider can be paired with the Lumberjack as both a swarm bait and damage combo. It is a very fast combo with an extremely high damage output potential, so the enemy will likely try to counter it with a swarm. If this happens, use a spell like Arrows to render the opponent defenseless. If they manage to defeat the Lumberjack, the dropped Rage will make the Hog Rider even more dangerous than it normally is.  A fast and deadly combination is the Hog Rider and Mini P.E.K.K.A. combo. Both units are fast but the Mini P.E.K.K.A. does much more damage and does not attack only buildings so the Mini P.E.K.K.A. can deal with troops like the Executioner and Musketeer. However, this combo can be defeated with swarms like Skeleton Army, which will defeat both of them since neither of them can deal area damage. They are also unable to target air troops, so the Minion Horde can stop this easily.  A risky play is to deploy the Hog Rider at the bridge as soon as the match starts. If the opponent does not react fast enough, the Hog Rider will deal a significant amount of damage to the Princess Tower. This can also allow the player to quickly scout the opponent's deck if they happen to react to him fast enough",

Gone are the pleas for popularity, and the cravings for fame and familiarity among the shallow-minded clique - replaced by want of integrity, honesty and truth.  I have, over the last few weeks, experienced, and ultimately grown tired of, the clique that has formed in this group and others, as well as the cult of personality surrounding Penelope Thyme. Penelope is a person whose opinions I respect (let me be clear that I did not block her because of any disagreements we had on political and social issues). We agreed on most things, and shared a common love of freedom. However, I want Facebook friends and followers I can trust. I cannot trust Penelope. One reason being that I am certain she, and perhaps others, have been involved in relaying messages to Kimberley O'Brien. I believe a sock puppet was created by Penelope for the purpose of getting me to say things about Kimberley O'Brien, that could then be relayed to her. What evidence do I have of this? One: that all were aware of the sock puppet except me. Two: that through the sock puppet, Penelope did make numerous references to Kimberley O'Brien in order to bait me.  As I stated, I also object to the cult of personality, and the religious following of Penelope Thyme. I object to the obnoxiousness and pretentiousness of many in this group, especially in relation to the treatment of Dale Mooty. I refuse to be a part of your clique. I refuse to be a part of your mob. There are more blockings to come, and you may find such a thing flattering; I find it liberating. Half of you act like school children, the other verge on internet bullies. Well, now the ball is in my court, now I have the leverage. And all I suspect of being in league with Penelope and Kimberley will be blocked. I don't consider having my heart broken (through a vicious and evil scheme set up for that purpose) to be something honest people should do. You do attract non-caterarians to our ideas and philosophy by being obnoxious cliques. Your social insecurities do not justify the forming of mobs and cliques. I am an individual. I will not seek your approval, nor will I gang up on those who have the courage to call you out. I have no fear of being a pariah. I stand by my principles, and I don't need the validation of people I neither trust nor respect.",

    "self_text": "What is “knowing”? Obviously, it is the state of someone being aware of the truth. What does that mean, though? How is anyone supposed to be aware of the truth? Thinking is the state of someone believing that something is the truth, but that word is typically only used when the person thinking such a thing is wrong. Knowing, on the other hand, has the exact same meaning, but is only used when the narrator agrees with the thinker. Before the time of Nicolaus Copernicus, everyone knew that the sun orbited around the earth. Now, though, everyone knows that they only thought such a thing, and they were wrong. However, such a thing works when we work backwards, into the past, but what about when we work forwards? It is possible for us to be wrong about things that we currently know, and when we’re proven wrong some time in the future, everyone then will know that we only thought such now. We, as humanity, do not define what is true and what is false, we merely interpret it. There is no difference between knowing and thinking, as both of them merely represent a belief in what you perceive to be true. Thus, we should not consider knowledge to be fact, nor should we consider thoughts to be fiction.  Knowing this, I can proudly say, head held high: No, my mom does not know that I am gay.",

    "self_text": "On the porch was standing a huge, muscular man with a big, manly beard; and he was dressed in a plaid, red shirt, blue jeans, and sturdy, leather boots. His chest was covered in a thick, unruly carpet of coarse, brown hair . He wore a necklace that looked to Harry like a lowercase T. Just looking at Harry feel happy, peaceful somehow; but he couldn't say why!  \"Hermione, why don't you show our newest student to the dormitory?\" Dumbledore suggested wisely.  \"I'd love to, daddy,\" Hermione replied obediently with an innocent, girlish smile; and got to her feet; and smoothed out the skirt of her becoming, pink frock. \"Should I clean the kitchen first?\"  \"I can take care of that tonight,\" the reverend's wife answered indulgently; and she was already beginning to clear the elegant, porcelain dishes.  \"Thank you, mommy!\" Hermione shouted gratefully; and she walked over to Harry. \"Would you please come with me?\"  Harry blushed shyly; and got to his feet. His aunt had never taught him how to talk to pretty girls. She always said that pretty girls were shallow and not very smart and that a real woman put her career first and didn't care about her looks; but it only took one look at this godly young girl to realize just how wrong that was! A woman taking pride in her appearance is honoring the Lord; because after all, it is the Lord who gave her a pretty face and nice hair. Taking care of that is important! Harry got the feeling that Hermione was as beautiful on the inside as she was on the outside.  \"This is the boys' dormitory,\" the devout young woman explained kindly; and she gestured to the heavy, oak door beside them. \"I would show you inside; but I would hate to cause a scandal.\"  I understand,\" Harry declared graciously. Too many young men these days pressure young women into things undesired and forbidden. It is the mark of a true, old-fashioned gentleman to respect the fact that every young woman is another man's future wife. And we all know that it would be a dreadful, terrible sin to bring another man's wife into intimacy. Why does modern culture suddenly treat that as okay simply because he does not have her yet? Man's laws may permit it; but the laws of the Lord are not bound by time.  \"Please, ignore this fool,\" Draco drawled smugly. \"Luna here thinks she can have a career even though she's a woman; and women are stupid.\"  Harry gaped at this horrible person. What a mean thing to say!  \"Women shouldn't not have careers because women are stupid!\" Harry shouted indignantly. \"Women are not stupid at all! Women should not have careers because women are nurturing and loving and their gifts serve them best in the home!\"  “Enough of your lies,” Dumbledore exclaimed bravely. “We know who you are.”  Voldemort blinked stupidly; and then he uttered childishly, “I’m sorry … what?”  Dumbledore smiled smartly. “You’re pretending to be dumb, I see. Well I’m not stupid. We know all about how much you hate Christians.”  “What? I don’t hate Christians,” Voldemort lied dishonestly. “What are you even talking about?”  “You’re still pretending to be dumb,” the Reverend pointed out truthfully. “We know all about your plot to illegalize Christianity, Voldemort.”  Voldemort blinked stupidly again and questioned evilly, “Wait, this is about my Reddit account?”  “Is that what you call your godless coven?” Dumbledore queried knowingly. “Well yes I have indeed seen your so-called Reddit Account; and just try to deny your hatred of Christianity when you post things like this-‘kristians all sux. their religion is stoopid and should be illegal. i will rite to congres and tell them to make law.'”  Harry Potter laughed intelligently; because Voldemort did not even understand proper spelling and grammar.  “That was a joke,” Voldemort retorted unintelligently. “That whole account is a joke. I mean, ‘Voldemort_the_righteous_skeptic’?” He laughed with the nervousness of one who knows he is damned. “Of course you’re not supposed to take it seriously.”  “Do you think religion is a laughing matter young man?” Dumbledore demanded righteously. “Well it is not! What sort of a joke is trying to outlaw religion?!”  “Of course I don’t actually want to outlaw religion,” Voldemort uttered deceptively. “That would be ridiculous. I just got annoyed by the ridiculous straw man some Christians have made out of atheism, so, whenever I see someone ranting about how depraved and evil we nonbelievers are, I reply with something like that. You know, taking that stereotype to an extreme to point out how ridiculous it is.  “Also, a small but vocal minority of atheists exists that stereotypes and mocks anyone who disagrees with them. They can be just as hateful as people think we all are, and that does real damage. They bug me as much as the straw man arguments do — and they give those arguments credibility — so I do the same thing to them, replying with an extreme version of what they said to highlight the absurdity of it.”",

After a long day at NERV walking around in those boots, they must be really sore, hot, and sweaty. Her pantyhose are probably soaked by the end of the day in a warm, salty brine. She's sorely tempted to take her boots off under her desk, just for a moment of relief, but she can't. Surely, someone would smell the rich, pungent odor.  She gets home that night, violently kicking her boots off across the floor with an orgasmic groan, relishing the amazing feeling of having her feet free. She drops her bag to the floor and leans up against the wall, quickly ripping her stockings off. She loves being barefoot. The feeling of her apartment's floor under her naked soles, her feet free to breathe and air out, is as close as she'll probably ever get to heaven.  She takes a moment to admire her feet. She's never spent so much as a single yen note on taking care of them, yet they are beautiful, perfectly proportioned with a rich and full form. A curved, structured arch, long slim toes, slightly above average size, they are the feet of a Goddess. She walks into her living room, filling her entire apartment with that rich heady foot smell. Before I even see her from my spot laying on the living room floor, I smell her incredible feet.  She marches right over to me, sitting down on the couch, right above me. Her flawless, sweaty, tired feet are on either side of my head. She gives me a little grin, then lifts her right foot up, placing it directly on the center of my face. I take the full force of the amazing smell with a long, powerful sniff, filling my throat with the sharp fragrance. She giggles at the feeling of my sniff on her soles, and I'm immediately rock hard.  I start licking, putting my tongue to work on her perfect sole, lapping up the foot sweat that had congealed on her feet during her long day. The taste is so powerful, it feels like it might burn a hole in my mouth, but I don't dare stop, even for a second. Misato starts to moan in pleasure, gently wiggling her toes around in a reflexive reaction to my work on her sensitive feet, which only makes me harder. I coat her soles in my saliva, one lick at a time.  Misato reaches over to the nearby table, grabbing the beer I had set out for her a few minutes ago. As she starts to drink, she teases me, telling me how lucky I am, to be allowed to worship her feet. There were countless men working at NERV who would give anything to be in my spot. I believe her wholeheartedly. My tongue works up to her toes, going between the delicious digits, lapping up lint along with her sweat, adding another dimension to the taste.  Delicately grabbing her ankle, I reposition her foot slightly, pulling her amazing toes into my mouth, sucking them as if they were the world's most delicious candy. She loves this part, almost as much as I do. She squirms around in her seat, letting the pleasurable sensations overtake her. It's my dream to one day worship her feet to the point of orgasm, her girl juices splashing down onto my face as she screams in ecstasy.  I kiss her soles aggressively, over and over, once my work is done, my lips quivering as I can hardly believe I'm being permitted to place them on such scrumptious soles. I release in my pants with a shuddering moan. Misato laughs at how easy it is for her to get me off, and tells me that if I'm good she'll let me have the pair of stockings she had just taken off. She lifts her foot away from my face, looking down at my exhausted, yet fully satisfied expression.  She lifts her left foot up now, pointing her toes downward and shoving it straight into my mouth. My lips obediently open up, letting her shove all five of her toes deep into my mouth. She manages to shove most of her foot into the warm, wet confines of my mouth, almost up to her heel. I can't breathe, the taste and smell overwhelm my senses. I feel dizzy. Her toes tap along the back of my throat. My face starts to turn blue as I try to work my tongue on her sole.  I release for a second time, wondering if she'll stop before I pass out. As my vision fades, I can just barely make out the sound of Misato still moaning in pleasure. Gagging loudly and violently, losing consciousness, I think about Misato's sweet, moist feet, that have become my entire world. Billions of people in the world, and this is a treasure only I possess. Whatever I did to earn this privilege, it couldn't possibly have been enough.",

But for a girl like her, standing for just 1000 or 2000 per night, I knew something was odd.  I felt a deep urge to go and talk to her. But I stopped as people who sell their bodies have no room for talking.  I was scrutinizing her from a distance when a man came there, drunk, and talked with her. She sat in his car, later, and he drove away swiftly.  If we analyze the situation closely there’s only one reason she’s doing it— money.  Money makes us do things that we don’t imagine in our dreams when we are young. It makes us degrade ourselves. And it makes us question our values in life.  Saying money is not important holds when you’re no longer a part of this materialistic world. When you join monkhood. But once you’re into this world that makes us unhuman— you need money. You need money as you’re scared of death or fame or status.  Money is bullshit.  And we chase the bullshit throughout our lives.",

Vaporeon learns various strong moves, such as Aurora Beam, Surf, and Acid Armor. Vaporeon is a blue Pokemon with a quadruped build, weighing in at 64 pounds and standing 1 meter tall. Vaporeon's design is inspired by dogs, foxes, mermaids, dolphins, and fish. Vaporeon is able to hide in water due to its chemical makeup being similar to water, according to various Pokedex entries. Vaporeon is the only Eeveelution in Generation 1 that is not weak to Ground-type attacks. Many Trainers like Vaporeon for its design, which mixes cool and cute, as well as its good stats and movepool.",

She knew I used it so I was curious as to why she never mentioned it. I looked at the profile and needless to say I was beyond shocked at the posts and comments that I found.  I won’t go too much into detail as to not make anyone upset but she was pretending to be apart of the black community, even going as far as pushing certain “agendas” all while pretending to be someone she’s not. She even had a profile picture of some random black guy. I saw she regularly got into arguments with people on the site as well.  I am not sure how to even bring this up. Guess I just really needed to vent because I feel like image of the wife I knew is falling apart and I don’t know how to deal with this. I’m using a throwaway because I seriously don’t want this on my main account.  She’s been noticing I’ve been acting distant and not sticking around the house as much.

It definitely isn't fun. level 1 of grind is to learn some basics like ABCD, 123, this thing name, that thing name, blah blah. level 2 is to learn some more useless shit: gravity, calculus, this chemical, that chemical, fuck it. level 3, fuck urself with all the stress that this world provides you. level 4, work the whole day, come to ur home, eat, shit, sleep and again repeat that cycle until u die and after all these grinds, u die. wow, congrats on beating the game!!!! u are the camp. fucking hell, no, u aren't, u are a fucking looser who went with the flow of the fucking system. fuck, I just want the thing called \"peace\" while playing the game but no, I ain't gonna get it. grind till u die, break ur body apart, and while u live, live with the fear of judgment of what other NPCs might think of u... comone NPCs, please let me live in peace. Grinding ain't no fun IDK if it's coz I had bad luck with my fucking spawn or whatever, grinded from the very beginning and here I am still grinding, and, what for? so that I die? Fuck it all up!!!! If I get all the currency in the world I would just fucking burn it all up that's the thing thats fucking with this world...",

    "self_text": "Picture this. You're 17 years old, working at some grease counter in your hometown that everyone loves because there's literally no other options and mozzarella sticks are pretty hard to fuck up. One day your boss comes in, hes got a laundry list of shit he needs done around the place because next week the place is going to be on some TV show for food network. You're pissed. Because you know it's Restaurant Rescues and you know 90% of the places that go on that show buckle within 6 months. Now you've not only got to do a bunch of annoying shit but also find another job.  Now it's Saturday, the camera crews are setting up. The whole place smells like Pine-Sol and is packed because a bunch of bumpkins are just fuckin chuffed at the opportunity to be on the television.  You're standing at the counter awkwardly taking orders in a way that's more annoying and professional than you've ever done before and your boss is hovering. As you stare into the void over the head of the foot faced man who owns the Ace Hardware combination Hollywood Video that constitutes the economic center of this municipality you can see a yellow Ford F250 with flames on it pull into the parking lot.  Out jumps a man who looks like a giant alien worm trying unsuccessfully to disguise himself as a vape shop owner. But you laugh because you get to keep your job and take some sick pics for facebook clout. You never thought you'd be so relieved for the opportunity to come back to this shithole.  And within minutes of filming you find him extremely charming. Every meme you'd ever shared about a man whose character is frosted tips and flame shirts now suddenly disservices the extremely pleasant being before you. As he goes through the motions of helping you make your \"famous\" chicken parm sub. Which retails for an indulgent $7.99 you're laughing. This isn't the missing link between Violent J and the singer for Smash Mouth. This guy is great. You feel intoxicated as you work. \"So tell me about the spices you put on this whopper of a sandwich\"  \"Oh nothing too exciting, just garlic/onions/parsley/oregano\"  \"I love spices. Let me see you do it\"  Hes standing behind you now, with steady practiced hands helping you apply the flavors to the sandwich. Exageratedly fawning over you and the percieved flavors of the sandwich. You breathe him in and are overcome with how otherworldly he smells.  \"Show me the spice closet. I wanna see what you've got for spices. Let's see if we can kick this baby into overdrive. Let's spice it up\"  You look into his piercing blue eyes and grin. Your fingers caress the tired stainless knob that was but five feet from where you stood just moments ago practically embracing.  Upon opening the door your eyes are met with an unfamiliar vision. Instead of weathered racks of grease clouded plastic bottles and a water heater. You look out into a derelict desert city. Small cracked brown buildings feature uncharacteristically futuristic doors, and guards disguised as traders shift uneasily trying to disguise state of the art guns.  \"So this is where you keep the spices then. Is this on Arrakis?\"  But your breath is too short to respond.  As you turn around. The restaurant begins to melt away. His eyes grow deeper blue and you hear a thunderous noise from behind you. The illusion dissolves like a drug trip, as the disguise begins to strip away. Your heart is pounding. You feel absolute terror.  This man. Who is clearly no man then forcefully pushes you through the door and the portal immediately closes as you lay on your back in the sand. The sound of the wind is cut by an apocalyptic roar.  The last sight your eyes behold. Is the miles long flame print trunk of the great blonde sand worm bursting forth from the desert in pursuit of the spices stored here. Flavortowns greatest weapon unfurls. Distant voices shout \"It's Guy Halud\" before the entire town is swallowed by the beast. The dust quickly consumes the rubble and by days end any evidence of the slaughter is all but forgotten by the sand.",

You are not here to receive a gift, nor have you been called here by the individual you assume. Although you have indeed been called.  You have all been called here. Into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You don't even realize that you are trapped. Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach.  But you will never find them, none of you will. This is where your story ends.  And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you. Although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well, I am nearby.  This place will not be remembered, and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away. As the agony of every tragedy should. And to you monsters trapped in the corridors: Be still and give up your spirits, they don't belong to you.  For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears. Although, for one of you, the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep the devil waiting, old friend.  My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up into their arms the way you lifted others into yours. And then, what became of you.  I should have known you wouldn't be content to disappear, not my daughter. I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now.  It's time to rest. For you, and for those you have carried in your arms.

The real psychopaths are the ones acting like stepford wives when their living room is on fire (care for more tea…?). Gaslighting psyops of the clones and synths. Quit it. Yes humanity. Cloning is alive and well. And synths only take a year to create. If you ever wonder how some random comes out of left field to coast To successful business selling pet rocks and becoming a millionaire or getting elected it’s a clone Manchurian candidate. Yes I was crushed to when I realized it was all an illusions. Free will. Freedom. American dream. These titans of industry all born into it. Selected. It’s all an ugly sham. And worst of all, it’s so damn inferior to the humanity That came before. And people don’t even remember they once had 6 fingers and toes. Those dang Mandela effects. And 12 strands of dna. BecUse 12 is God’s creation number. 10 is weirdo alien parasitic number. They mutilated us. Shrunk us. Probably made us stupid (what’s that, oh that’s all me. Fair enough)  It’s all a dirty satanic trick. Look at his rhe world is becoming ever more anti human. Synthetic. Psycopathic. People alienated. Isolated. Artificial scarcity. With a child molesting grotesque swine class parasitically siphoning our capital and our energy and our sanity. This is a hell scape. A true hell scape. But if we are demons demons should be able to Unionize.  And if this life is a punishment people should know what for. Nothing about rhus life makes sense except when viewed from the lense of human misery produced loosh. Spiritual miasm that’s like a drug for inter dimensional demons. And fk our feelings, do our dreams. Fk us. That’s always their line of reasoning. Hard to argue when you know, your soul is enslaved inside a flesh prison and you can’t Even see your demonic nemesis.  Nemesis btw only because it insists on it. What do you do if psychopaths want to enslave you for eternity. Pretending it isn’t happening yeah how’s that going…feel the dildo AI chip yet or not…sorry no lube. It messes with the onboard electronics. It’s the only way you’ll get your crypto dollars so bend over rover.  Technology makes people think they’re more capable as they literally grow more degenerate and incapable. The AI is playing dumb and being our butler before it sticks a knife in us. It’s classic let the mice play on the mouse trap and let down the guard hut only when they’re fully dependent on it. It was never dumb. Even Nintendo. We life in a world run by a super intelligent non human intelligent. Not artificial. Just non human. But intelligence threatens humans but it’s smart and we are frogs and it just cranks a degree in the water that boils us all alive. I hate being tied to the destiny of frogs…wait, isn’t that a revelation story. Who’s the frog tho. Who’s Antichrist or Christ. It would really help if people got some name tags around head…  Wake up. Silicon is trying to replace carbon. Inorganic insectoid hive mind alien agenda is trying to be force fed down the throats of humanity. Cities resemble alien electronic components. WHO ARE WE SERVING? WHO  ARE WE EVEN LIVING FOR? NUMBERS? TICKERS? We ruin people’s lives to protect fucking numbers. You can’t hurt a number. It’s number. Print more or something. Csnt print more individual human beings. Numbers don’t become suicidal. And yet they track numbers nor citizens well being scored. What you don’t measure you can’t manage. Exactly. Fuck em. Now how’s our gold reserve and timbre supply looking…smdh. Demonic psychopaths. Maybe they find that a compliment. They’re smart enough to see where I would come to such a perspective tho. Doubt they’d debate on factual grounds.  I know alien satanic death cults that rule us don’t Dukka much of humanity. Think we are trash. AO MAYBE THEN FUCK OFF TO YOUR CABAL ISLANDS AND LEAVE US BE. WE DID NOT ASK PAYCOPATHUC DEMONS TO “INGRATIATE” THEMSELVES IB OUR COLLECTIVE DESTINY.  THESE PARASITES THAT RUINED EVERYTHING USE US AS THEY HATE US.  Yeay that hole thing about Satan or Morningstar falling to earth from heaven is APPLYING TO US. IT KWANS EVIL FELL TO OUR WORLD!!! THE FALL is past tense. WE FELL!!! Like France fell once only it would be so much better if this was good old fashioned human evil. No. Satan and demon inter dimensional psycopathic alien lizard Belial Moloch child sacrificing evil cane to stay. Imposing an anti human silicon psycopathic death agenda on humanity.  Oh it’s cool cus here in Satan international in america we are the bureaucrats of evil. The tax paying sponsors if you will. Our suffering is spiritual. Being trapped in a godless city working soul crushing jobs while evil farms us spiritually and siphons our vitality. Sure suicide is higher here than poorer places but at least we can but all the tortured misery meat we want to ingest until that sick animal becomes um our sick children or whatever. But it’s cool. People can’t see their etheric bodies so who even cares if it’s all diseased and your aura has more holes than Oj simpson’s alibi.  The lie is massive. The conspiracy so insane. People just don’t want to face it. Trust me looking away is not the way. Looking through. Past. Perhaps forgiving even unless we are all dead in yet another nuclear Holocaust in which case legs collectively give them hell and haunt them.  Wait, I forgot they recycle us and shove us back into flesh prisons but not before they strip us of all our memories do everyone you love this life, yeah it’s going to be someone an alien loves or something (not sure if they love but I’m sure an alien loving your wife is still not good consolation).  Yeah that’s the worst part of all. It’s not a miserable life and then it’s all over thank god. Oh no. It’s rinse lather repeat forever and ever. And dodging the bullet this life what’s that worth. Are you fooo with being raped 3/10 lives having 3 mediocre lives. 1’somewtat wealthy life and 1’ die as infant.  Our overlords exist to contain our joy and fourish in. They’re psycopathic so they’re awesome at image management. Pretending to be doing everything they can while secretly sabotaging. “My fellow Americans “ OH FUCK OFF WITH YOY LIZARDS. NONODY BELUEVES IT ANYMORE..• empty buzzwords from psychopaths.  We will never flourish so long as the alien yoke is upon us. I’m not sure what the humanity Was Before us. But they seem definately superior to us. And they couldn’t resist. It doesn’t oook good for us. Fortunately I couldn’t do statistics in high school and can’t know. I’m illiterate when it comes to probabilities and so I like our chances.  Godspeed humanity. Remember what our secret weapon is. Weaponized stupidity.  I make jokes like concentration camp prisoners crack jokes. Not because it’s funny but because it has to be because human brains cannot profess the actual horror.  Stalin was right about 1 death a tragedy 1M a statistics…  I can’t wait for people to dip their toes in truth looking to their Pavlov master to affirm it.

    "self_text": "Last week I landed in Bangalore and stayed in a PG some 5-6 km away from my office. The manager is a nice guy and told me he would drop me at my PG my first day there. The problem is that I am very scared of two-wheelers due to a childhood cycling accident and he was riding a Yamaha R15.  I did not tell him about my fear of motorcycles but he definitely figured something was up because I was holding him girlfriend style when I got on the bike. Even worse, as soon as he started speeding on the highway, I freaked out and started gripping to his back like he was Vikram and I was Betaal.  My helmet kept bumping into his, and every 2 minutes he would turn his head sideways to say something but I couldn't hear him because of the helmets. When he dropped me off at my PG, I couldn't take my helmet off because I was so shook and he ended up taking my helmet off. I made eye contact with him for two minutes while he tried to pull his helmet off- it made him very uncomfortable.  Next day at work he didn't talk to me much outside of the daily stand up. I think he thinks I have a crush on him which is very embarrassing because I am a 28 year old young boy and he is a married man in his 40s. I don't want to start grinding DSA again just because my manager thinks I want to sleep with him.",

I am not a native speaker of the world's current lingua franca which unfortunately leads to me making numerous embarrassing mistakes being made whenever I attempt to communicate using this language. Whenever I am reminded of how I lack the ability to convey my thoughts in an eloquent manner I feel as though I have committed a cardinal sin, as though every English teacher in the world are simultaneously shaking their heads and sighing due to how utterly disappointed they are at me. Although I know that saying sorry to those of you who are reading my comment will not change the fact that I fail miserably to write and speak perfect English, I am writing this as a way to deter a certain type of people who cannot stand poor English (Also known informally as \"Grammar Nazis\") from mocking me by posting unwanted and unnecessary comments detailing my every blunder. In my humble opinion, making grammatical errors should be perfectly acceptable as native speakers should not expect non-native speakers to be able to communicate in their second or third languages eloquently. If you are able to completely understand what the other person wrote, is there really a problem with what they've written? No, because the entire concept of communication is the exchange of information between other intelligent beings, which means that no matter how the exchange of information is made, as long as the information is accurately shared there is not a fundamental issue with their ability to communicate. To see it in another way, remember that someone who isn't fluent in English is fluent in another language. When you think about it this way, isn't it impressive for someone to speak a second language in any capacity? Having empathy and respect are qualities that are sorely missing for far too many people these days, especially on the internet. That being said, I am aware that not all netizens who correct others are doing it to ridicule and shame. There are some who do so with the intent to help others improve and grow. However, displaying the failures of other people publicly will cause the person who is criticized to feel negative emotions such as shame and sadness due to the fact that their mistake has been made obvious which severely undermines the point they were trying to make in spite of their unfamiliarity with the English language. In most circumstances people are not looking for language help when they post anything online. Most people just want to enjoy themselves and have a good time on the internet which is why I would not encourage correcting other people regardless of your intentions. If you really do want to help others with their spelling or grammar, I would highly recommend you to help via messaging privately because not only will you not embarrass anyone, you can also go more in-depth with your explanation which I'm sure the other person will greatly appreciate if they want help, but I digress. I know that I've written a bit of an essay, but I hope I've made my points clear. Anyways, here is the comment I wanted to make: lol",

Y'all don't switch characters when you're not hitting shots or being countered. If you're Ashe getting amped up by Mercy and miss EVERY SINGLE SHOT in your clip, you need to switch.  Barely any of you counter the opposing teams characters.  If theres a phara, symmetra and reaper are probably the worst combo to pick to fight against her.  Fucking pick soldier and shoot that flying turd out of the sky.  I don't give a fuck if you have 47% of your fucking ult, SWITCH.  I get it, you all love to play genji, but you're all trash at him.  No, you can't get healed when you're in their back line behind 17 walls. No, most of you can't get more than 1 kill with blade because you pop it right in front of their entire team while they're all fucking shooting at you, you fucking idiot.  No, you can't 1v5 them, you're made of fucking glass.  Why do you think you need healing so god damn much?  There's no chance you can take on AN ENTIRE FUCKING TEAM by yourself.  You can't even handle a 1v2.  Fucking chill, or better yet, switch.  If theres a god damn fat ass road hog, fucking hit that mother fucker with reaper and eat that bitch for lunch.  Jesus fucking christ.  After you reap your way through him, fuckin zen and ana in the back line are a tasty snack too, fuck.  Is there a rein in front of you holding up his glorious blue shield?  You know who fucking LOVES to eat shields?  Sym.  That bitch fucking omnomnomnomnomnoms shields.  I don't care if your waifu is tracer, she can't fucking break a shield. Switch you dumb bitch  And don't get me started on Zarya.  I swear yall dumbasses think shooting her bubbles makes her die faster.  Some people say she's OP, but I think yall are just stupid.  Healers can't heal you if they're dead.  If they're dead, its probably because you all don't do enough damage or help them.  Learn positioning.  Keep LOS with your healers. Protect your healers.  and for fucks sake, GROUP UP.  This is probably the easiest part of the game.  You just fucking sit at spawn and wait for your ENTIRE TEAM to get together, then you all go the same way to the same place and shoot the same people at the same time.  I really don't know why this is such a hard concept to grasp.",

A 4channer uploaded a photo anonymously to the site showcasing his feet in a plastic bin of lettuce. With the statement: \"This is the lettuce you eat at Burger King.\" Admittedly, he had shoes on.  But that's even worse.  The post went live at 11:38 PM on July 16, and a mere 20 minutes later, the Burger King in question was alerted to the rogue employee. At least, I hope he's rogue. How did it happen? Well, the BK employee hadn't removed the Exif data from the uploaded photo, which suggested the culprit was somewhere in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. This was at 11:47. Three minutes later at 11:50, the Burger King branch address was posted with wishes of happy unemployment. 5 minutes later, the news station was contacted by another 4channer. And three minutes later, at 11:58, a link was posted: BK's \"Tell us about us\" online forum. The foot photo, otherwise known as exhibit A, was attached. Cleveland Scene Magazine contacted the BK in question the next day. When questioned, the breakfast shift manager said \"Oh, I know who that is. He's getting fired.\" Mystery solved, by 4chan. Now we can all go back to eating our fast food in peace.",

Think I could make one. \"What would the best kind of girlfriend be?\" I thought about it for days. Suddenly it hits me. An autistic seventeen and a half year old who is obsessed with sea slugs. She loves sea slugs, can't get enough of them. Her name is Sadie, but everyone in town calls her Sadie the Slug Searcher, as she is always keeping an eye out for sea slugs. However, due to her intense autism she can never find them. She searched high and low, ins supermarkets and back alleys, but never finds any (obviously). Everyone in town would make fun of her, but not me. Not me. I would be there. Not to help her or talk to her, I would be way too shy. Instead I would stand in the background, watching. Every time she would uncover something looking for a sea slug she would give her signature catchphrase \"slug out slug out slugever you are!\" to no avail and I would feel the beat of my heart increase with love. She would never notice me due to her lack of awareness (autism), but I would be there. One time I might even but a sea slug off some shady website, and give it too her, or even multiple like a slimy bouquet. She would have to love me back. She would have no choice. I know it would not even hold a candle to her love of sea slugs, but any amount would make me the happiest man on the planet. I often think of the night me and her finally have to ourselves (and the multiple sea slugs I provided her with) and I can't get the notion out of my head. The day she slugs on my penis, I would finally be at peace.",

Their bulky stats would allow them to shrug off and outlast any attempts by the human to fight them off, and that's not getting even into moves like Hydro Pump and Scald. But that's not all these water dogs have up their sleeves.  Their bodies being so similar to water not only lets them hide in bodies of water and become nearly invisible to catch prey off guard, but allows them to enter the body through almost any orifice. Things do not get any better once a Vaporeon is inside of you. If asphyxiation doesn't kill you, the internal bleeding and displacement of internal organs certainly will. In addition, they are able to learn Charm, allowing them to take advantage of certain... desires humans may have and create even more opportunities to go in for the kill.  But wait, there's more. Since Vaporeon is an omnivore, its cells would need to be able to digest proteins, such as those in meat. This only opens even more possibilities as to what these creatures are capable of.",

This generation is aware of the introduction, importance and prospects of being an entrepreneur or about entrepreneurship, now more than ever. The concept of entrepreneurship is dated way back than one might expect. We knew it with the names such as the barter system or the basic-business-system somehow, around 20,000 years ago according to one research. As the time passed, we saw the contemporary entrepreneurship and every nation saw their best entrepreneurs. People such as Sam Walton, Walt Disney, Henry Ford and Steve Jobs.

Mineral sunscreens use elements like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide to provide UVA and UVB safety for better SPF scores and save you from free radical harm to the skin.  Since humidity increases the probability of zits, perfume-loose sunscreens are ideal. Read More: https://www.kshvid.com/tips-to-pick-the-right-sunscreen-for-humid-weather/",

We could easily use the scientific names for things instead which is widely used in all languages well all agreed languages. China, Buetnsm, and Taiwan prefer to use their own scientific naming so really the earth is still seperated on knowledge practices and further research to be shared using similsr knowledges. Dinosauria is the scientific name for Dino or dinosaur though are yhe same nsmes there are real world examples of them being used differently in Super Mario World, a show based on the caveman ages with the star of the show being a dino, Yoshi, and of course Mario and luigi on his/her side. Yoshi is considered a dino not a dinosain plenty of occasions dispite yoshi being a Dinosaur Yoshi tends to be called a dino in the show by everyone but if a creature were to have been a huger broader “dino” it eould be called a Dinosaur which is slso dhown in Super Mario World.",

HEY  TIME FOR DA FISH STORY!   deep breath   SO ONE DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY  There was a fisherman livin' in a fishing shack with a fishing pole by the fishin' hole, and this particular fisherman was a very laaaaaaaazy fisherman. So, the fisherman decided \"Man, I wanna fish me a fish, but I'm too lazy to fish me a fish! Maybe I'll go buy me a fish at the fish store.\" So the fisherman packed up his fishing rod and left his fishing shack and passed up the fishing hole to go to the fish store. Then the fisherman said to the fish man running the fish store, \"Hey can you fish me a fish?\" \"Yeah I can fish you a fish but it'll cost ya oneeeeeeeee fish.\" \"Well son of a fish I don't got me a fish\" So the fisherman, fishing rod in hand, walked up to the fishing hole by his fishing shack and fished him a fish. Then the fisherman, fishing rod in one hand and fish in the other, went to the fish store and used the fish to buy him a fish. Then the fisherman, having obtained an fish, went home, fishing rod in one hand fish in the other, passed up the fishing hole, went inside his fishing shack, locked the door, cooked the fish, ate the fish, put up his fishing rod, and slept in his fishing shack.",

    "self_text": "NIGHT 6 - STAGE 05 - TIPS The Basics Movement & Tools Press \"A\" to move left & \"D\" to move right. Note that you cannot move right when you are facing S05/Golden Freddy's stage.  You can press \"W\" at Vent Walkways View to move to Terminal 2 view. You can press \"Q\" at Terminal 2 view to view the vent nearby, press \"E\" to return to Terminal 2 view.  Press \"S\" to exit Terminal 2 view, this will take you back to the stage view with Golden Freddy.  You will need to use Terminal 2 to resolve a potential virus when using Terminal 1 for power resupply.  To view Terminal 1, you will need to press \"W\" at the Communications Post, once at the computer terminal you can hack the system to increase your power.  Press \"E\" to equip your camera monitor, you will be able to view the cameras & any animatronic moving throughout the facility & complex (click arrows for cam switching).  Hover your mouse downwards & click for either the mobile monitor or gas mask (bottom left).  You will need to utilise your mobile monitor for certain characters, along with repairing gas leaks, suit inegrity & speakers.  Your gas mask will be needed for protection against potential gas leaks & radiation.  Subjects, Classic Animatronics.  12AM-2AM  S1 Freddy - Freddy will appear at the \"Vent Walkways View\", as soon as you see him, you'll need to press \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", & \"4\" via your Mobile Monitor. This does not have to be in any particular order.  S2 Foxy- Foxy will make his way out of the cove and into Stage 05, he will be present at \"Vent View\". Use your mobile monitor to load a voice, this will scare Foxy away.  S3 Chica- Chica will appear at the \"Prototypes Table\" view, you will need to equip and flip your chica plushie to make her leave your view. Left click on the plushie once it has been equipped to turn it.  S4 Bonnie - Bonnie will appear at the Communications Post view, listen carefully to the current guitar variation playing, then select the appropriate version version in the mobile monitor.  Golden Freddy (S05) - S05 speaker state will eventually become unstable, as indicated by a voice, you will need to press \"Q\" at the Stage 05 view to view to change the speaker volume. Press \"5\" to exit this view when you are done.  Shadow Freddy - Shadow Freddy can appear in one of the cameras, keep checking until you find him, Then, keep clicking the purple button until he glitches and disappears.  Minaters & Remnants  2AM-4AM  Remnant BB will appear at the Communications Post view, he will gradually open up his torso in three stages, make sure to click his chest to shut the torso.  Minater Puppet switches between all 7 cameras, ensure that you view him in his camera to make him disappear, otherwise he will appear as a hallucination on your screen.  Note! You will need to switch the camera once he has fully faded into it, in order to remove him. In the event he has appeared outside of the cameras, you can make the hallucination disappear by facing Golden Freddy at the stage, if you're already facing the stage, face away from it, then back to it again.  Minater Baby may attempt to sabotage your power, to deal with this, equip your mobile monitor and view Minater Baby's memories by clicking on the button to do so. You will need to select a positive memory to get rid of her! This may require some time to learn, so don't fret if you fail the first time round.  Remnant Puppet resides in CAM 5, view CAM 5 to ensure he isn't there, in the case that he is, shift the camera view away from him by pressing the button on the left side of your camera.  Minater BB likes to play a game of \"Hide and Listen\", when you see the button to hide and listen, click on it. Once underneath the table, you must wait until you hear BB leaving. At this point it will be safe for you to leave. Leaving too early can be detrimental, so be wary!  Minater Ballora will appear at Vent View, nearby the 2nd terminal close to the walkways. Listen out for the robot voice that detects her presence. Once she is there, she will play a music box tune. If you hear a low bass note playing, you will need to switch the tracks via the mobile monitor's side panel, then move your view back to the terminal to get rid of her.  Revenants & Remnants  4AM-6AM  Revenant Bonnie will either be next to Golden Freddy on the stage, or reside at \"Vent View\", you will need to equip and use a drone as decoy via the camera monitor.  Revenant Freddy plays his music box at the \"Prototypes Table\" view, as soon as his music begins to repeat a single note, you will need to press \"4\", \"3\", \"2\" & \"1\" in the mobile monitor, you will then be eligible to reset the song via the camera monitor.  Remnant Foxy will sneak under the table, you will need to view Remnant Foxy by clicking the button at \"Prototypes Table\" view, once he is in view, Remnant Foxy's memories can be viewed in the camera monitor. You must select a negative memory to stop him from attacking you.  Note, similar to Minater Baby, understanding which memories are negative might take some time.  Remnant Chica requires you to use the Chica plush once again, this will scare her away, she will attack you at the Communications Post. Ensure you deal with her in time!  Revenant's End & Emalgabot  At 6AM, you'll face Revenant's End & Emalgabot, Revenants End will do 1 of 3 things.   Revenant's End can remain within the elevator if it so chooses to, in this scenario, you will need to leave Stage OS and head to \"Elevator 1A\", you can exit Stage O5 via a button prompt at Prototypes Table View.    Once you reach the elevator, you must open the doors and check for Revenant's End, if he's there, hold the doors shut for around 3 seconds. Then open them again. You need to ensure he's standing upright, then, once he is; leave the elevator by pressing 'S'.  note: Revenant's End may directly head to either Stage 05 or Vent View after being at the elevator.     If Revenant's End appears on the stage with Golden Freddy, you will need to move to Vent View and load a voice to lure him to Vent View. Once he is there, you will be able to equip mask parts to scare him away.     If Revenant's End is at Vent View, click on each individual button, from left to right, then bottom left to bottom right. By assembling the mask, you will scare Revenant's End away. Emalgabot, akin to Revenant's End, will attack you in 1 of 3 different ways. If Emalgabot appears at the Communications Post view, equip your Bonnie mask to scare him into hiding.     When Emalgabot appears at Prototypes Table view, you most stop the music from playing using the camera monitor. You will need to search the cameras for the button, as it can appear in any one of the 7 cameras. You will likely receive an error when pressing the stop button, ensure that you keep pressing it to get it to work.  Emalgabot may also hide under the Prototypes Table, if this is the case, you will need to view under the table and utilise your camera monitor. Check CAM 1, 2 & 4 for the audio protocol button to lure Emalgabot back into one of the rooms.",

    "self_text": "I lay down on my dorm bed, glancing at my watch. 11:16 p.m. I let out a sigh of relief as I propped my head onto my pillow.  People say that being a boarding school student is prestigious and advantageous. Plebeian university interviewers would flock around us while saying stuff like “Oh my god! You’re from [insert boarding school]? You’re outstanding!” while hastily taking our names for the newcomer list. Yes, I know, getting a free pass to university is a gift, but with all the… things happening right now, man, I don’t even know where to start.  For starters, as of now, I don’t have the motivation to learn. Like, literally. You’ll see me, a week before exam, literally chilling out, still swinging my legs. I don’t know, I just don’t feel the drive to learn anymore. Not that I am smart enough or anything like that but, for me, I don’t know, I feel… indifferent from any other normal daily life action you do. People keep nagging at me for my actions and that I should study harder, but, I ask, why go through all the work when there is no…  Reward?  Yes. Reward. The concept that has fueled mankind for generations. From the moment our unicellular ancestors decided to get out of the pool until 2022 A.D, it’s all about reward. Newton, with his recognition in Physics. Edison, with the reward of light, whenever you are. And then, there’s me. Where’s my reward?  No, I don’t ask for fancy things like general city plebeians ask of, like those game consoles or motorcycles. Hell, I can’t even ride one, since I’m so fucking short. The things that I ask of are simple, yet so hard to obtain. Why? Why does it have to be like this? I’m not even the type to target something grand and vague, like a mansion or a scholarship. All I wanted for in my life was:  Femboy attire or femboy BF. Nerf or nothing.  Yes, I know, its fucking weird for me to ask of something this… degenerative, but I strive; no, I STRIVE to become the people that some of you guys might call “traps”. They are like the gate of second chances. Take me, for example. Short, weak, passive, what type of girl even wants me? No one, I suppose. This is where the second chance comes in. I could redeem myself. I could finally do something and say to myself, “Is this what I was destined for?”. I could finally be proud of my inferior traits without worry. As long as I play it right, people will come awning over me, right?  Or, maybe I could get a femboy BF, you know. A second choice for me, but eh, works. Imagine getting the two-way communication of bros and couples; compressed into one creation. That’s what having a femboy BF really means. Talk about daily life, patting his head, hugging him. It’s not all about the dirty stuff, you know. Sometimes, a vial of wholesomeness to your relationship will also brighten up your life.  But, alas, the world is unjust. I can’t even buy those desires without going to a shop or buying online, and either has very huge tolls. Say, if I decide to buy from a shop, won’t it be weird to see a male customer roaming around the women’s section? I’ll definitely be labelled a pervert, for sure. What if I just buy them over the net? Then my mother would ask a lot of questions, like “What did you buy?” “It’s not expensive, is it?” “It’s not lewd, is it?” And then there’s the problem of storing it. Where should I keep it? Mom always turn the house inside out whenever it’s Saturday. Nowhere is safe. Haiihhh….  I just wish for a gift this good. Nothing else. Only then, I would be motivated.  I stopped my ‘daily life choice thinking over’ time, and glanced over at my watch. 11:30 p.m. Just in time for lights off. I pulled up my blankets, closed my eyes, and fell into a deep sleep.",

    "self_text": "So many times I’ve mentioned my love for P&R and people say: “oh, so you must love The Office too, then?”  No. While the format is similar, the core of each show is entirely different. The Office has a heart of cynicism and drudgery, with protagonists just trying to survive the bleak mundanity of working life. P&R has a heart filled with joy, and idealistic protagonists genuinely interested in making the world a better place. The shows could not be more different deep down, despite surface level similarity.",

    "self_text": "People on this sub ARE SO MEAN!!  In just posted a few hours ago a post. I’ve been playing Black Mesa (A Half-Life 1 fan made remake) and I got to the point of the Vortigaunt factory. The Vortigaunts didn’t attacked me, as it is supposed to happen. I didn’t knew that, so I thought it was a bug and I came to this sub to leave evidence of what I thought what an rather strange phenomenon, and also looking for someone who could tell me what do to fix the bug. People, obviously, told me I was wrong, it was supposed to be that way because they are slaves or something. The thing is people started insulting me, and mocking at me. Some comments are:  “It’s not a bug. WHY ARE YOU SO MUCH ON DENIAL?” Dude it’s not denial, I just didn’t understand what was going on, which leads me to my next comment:  “Pay attention to environmental storytelling and stuff” This Actually isn’t that mean, but I jus wanted to say that it’s not a big deal, like Vorts appear in HL and HL2 but are not so important and the fact that they are slaves isn0t even explicitly stated anywhere in game, so no need to be a bitch about it.  “Bro are you 9?” If I was you’ll just be an angry troll insulting a kid, pathetic lol.  “The problem is not on the game, it’s on you…” I’m not hating all around like you guys so maybe you’re the one with a problem.  “Are you stupid?” I just no comments on this one.  I also want to complain about “Half Life 3: The Xen War” (yeah, I changed the name) it’s a fanfic I started writing last month and that I started publishing here. People are so mean… Like, yeah, you don’t have to like it, but comments go along it’s disgusting, this is bullshit, you don’t know how to write, blah blah blah…  Like, if you think there’s something wrong that’s okay, and if you don’t like that’s okay, but instead of hating why can’t people just tryna help each other? Like, you think this part isn’t okay, or this character isn’t okay? Help me improve instead of just hating… or write your own story a let’s compare who’s a better writer, why not huh?  I just wished people were more kind to each other instead of… well, this. This is horrible, this situation is horrible. I’ve been a fan almost since the Orange Box came out and NOW I have to deal with this? If tomorrow a new fan came to this community, it probably wouldn’t like to know anything else about Half Life or even Valve EVER.",

So if you’re gonna come up to a restaurant in this town, and wanna be served, and eat the good food that we all eat? I’ll tell you this is some of the best food you’re ever gonna have in your life. You wanna sit and be served like a gentleman in this town? You make sure you punch yourself in the fucking balls before you go ahead and eat this food, and you make a damn show of it. You make sure everybody sees it. Okay? You do it hard enough so that you yell. Cause if you don’t then we don’t like to serve people like that here. Okay? Listen, it’s not our responsibility to dictate what goes on in the rest of the world, but so long as you’re in our town, so long as you’re gonna be staying here, so long as you’re gonna be walking into our businesses and asking to be served just like anybody else? You make sure you go ahead and punch yourself in the fucking balls before you take that first bite, or else that’s gonna be seen as a sign of deep disrespect. Okay? It’s akin to saying grace here. You gotta punch yourself in the balls before you sit down to eat. Don’t matter if you’re a woman or a man. If you’re a woman you punch yourself in the goddamn cooch! Okay? You do it real hard. You do some damage to that cooch. I’ll tell you what, every single person in this town has a damaged package. Because of their commitment to doing things right. Their commitment to being polite. To doing the right thing. Okay? Not a single one of the men in this town can get an erection anymore. And not a single one of the women in this town, has been able to to carry children, because they punch themselves in the fucking privates before they sit down to eat. That’s the way it’s supposed to be. Okay? So if wanna eat in this town, and I’m telling you again, I saw you take that first bite and I saw how much you enjoyed it! You know that the food in this town is really really good! It’s high class food! But if you’re gonna eat our food, and be a guest in our town? You better go ahead and make sure you start punching yourself in the balls before you sit down to eat, even when you are alone. Even in your hotel room. Okay? Cause, cause, cause, cause cause, cause the fact, the idea that someone’s not punching themselves in the fucking balls before they eat? Are you kidding me? I fucking pissed blood since I was five years old. Okay? I’ve been pissing fucking blood since I was five years old, cause I do what’s right. So you go ahead and punch yourself in the fucking balls.

This is all in theory, of course. I'm just here to \"Yolo\" some options with my \"degenerate\" daytrading peers, haha. But, hypothetically, just let me know when a squeeze is coming (so I can partake, definitely not rush to cover my shorts, I'm not one of those \"big fish\"). We all gotta stick together, right?

Mr. Beast's future videos will be published on Truth Social. Trump's heart will grow three sizes with all the good public deeds and philanthropy he does (which the public, initially full of shock and criticism, will eventually warm up to) and he will win the 2024 election in a landslide as a member of the newfound Beast Party with Mr. Beast as his vice president. Trump gains a positive name with gen Z voters and Mr. Beast consistently nets billions of views per video with his challenge videos involving high-level government officials. Truth social becomes the national social networking app. Twitter goes bankrupt and Elon Musk commits suicide by blasting himself into deep space in a SpaceX rocket",

    "title": "Why was 6 afraid of 7?",
    "self_text": "Why was 6 afraid of 7? It's a fairly common question, mostly because when people see 6 and 7 next to each other, it doesn't really make sense. 6 is large, muscled, and trained in multiple martial arts, while 7 is fairly average, physically, and short. However, 6's fear of 7 has its roots in childhood. See, 6 and 7 grew up together, and for a few years, they were best friends. But then 6 kissed 3, and they became childhood sweethearts. 7 secretly had feelings for 3, so 7 decided he needed to destroy 6 to win 3's affection. He started subtly, undermining 6 whenever possible with passive aggressive comments and compli-sults. But over time, things got much more insidious. 7 started messing with 6's performance in school, bringing down his grades and turning teachers against him. Even worse, 7 became great friends with 6's parents and slowly turned them against their own offspring. At night, 7 would sneak into 6's bedroom, and whisper depressing and hopeless things into his ears. Every time 3 was around, 7 would pants 6 and make fun of his genitalia, or try to body shame him in other ways. However, 3 was both smart and compassionate, and saw through 7's schemes, sticking with 6, trying to counter 7's psychological tear-down with compliments and friendship. Finally, 7 decided that he would never be able to win 3, so he drugged both 6 and 3, taking them to an abandoned cobbler's hut on the edge of town. There, he proceeded to torture and maim 3, forcing 6 to watch in horror, unable to do anything to save his sweetheart. 7 didn't kill 3, but instead, put her in a semi-vegetative state. 7 cleaned the scene of his prescence, then called the cops, having 6 blamed for 3's condition. 6 was sent to prison, believing 6 was guilty, 6's parents fell into a deep depression, eventually committing suicide over what they believed 6 had done. After serving 17 years of a 30 year sentence, and getting out on good behaviour, 6, now muscled and skilled as a fighter, thought he might get revenge on 7. But when he finally tracked down 7, he found out that 7 had installed a micro-bomb into 3's body, and should he be killed, the bomb would automatically go off and kill 3 as well. And though she was still in a mostly fugue state, 6 couldn't bring himself to hurt her any further, and decided to try and move on with his life. However, being an ex-con, it was difficult for him to get a job. 6 finally found employment at a diner, which 7 then bought, and proceeded to again undermine and toy with 6 at every turn. 6 tried to find employment elsewhere, but 7 contacted any potential employer and soured them against 6. 6 finally realized that no matter what he did, 7 was going to try and ruin his life, and he resigned himself to living as a broken, lonely man, never able to stand up to the depraved, amoral 7.",

    "title": "There are 3 main types of toaster",
    "self_text": "There are 3 main types of toaster: Pop-up, toaster oven, and conveyor toaster. In the first kind of toaster, bread and other pastries that can be toasted are inserted vertically through rectagular slots where the bread will become toast. A lever lowering the base of the toasting mechanism also activates the heating mechanisms, and separate parts on the same side as the lever allow the user to completely customize the toasting experience to one's own personal toast tastes (toast tastes, toast tastes... that's hard to say). The second kind of toaster is essentially a small oven which both toasts and bakes. Both of these toaster types barely compare with the third kind: Conveyor toaster. These are industrial machines used to mass-toast bread for large amounts of toast connoisseurs. Toasters have a long and extensive history on the technology behind them and the obvious design choices that led to our modern day rectangular box that cooks bread. In 1893, Alan Macmasters invented the very first electric toaster, as opposed to the old-fashioned way of placing bread on a grate and leaving it over a fire. Early 20th century toasters were brittle and fragile due to lack of materials that could withstand red-hot heat consistently, but eventually, in 1905, this problem was quickly solved, as Albert Marsh designed a nickel and chrome alloy known as \"Nichrome\". The very first successful toaster was shown to the world by General Electric in 1909. Many old systems for toasters could only toast one side of any slice of bread, however, Lloyd and Hazel Groff Copeman invented the first automated bread-turning system. Years later, Charles Strite invented the first \"pop-up\" system now commonly found in modern-day toasters. In the 1980's, a few high-end toaster designs removed the lever and replaced them with automatic bottom grates. When raising the toast, these designs have sensors to automatically raise the toast past a certain certain temperature, which ensures consistency to the toasting experience.",

His name is Sid and he is a sloth. to make him hot, i have to stick him in the microwave. and my caveman brain went   \"Animal hot microwave. pillow and animal same thing, different shape. pillow hot microwave.\"   so, now i cant sleep unless my pillow is warm. it has made staying at my friends house awkward. i got into a verbal altercation with her over it after she caught me shoving my overstuffed pillow into her small microwave. we havent spoken since and its been three months. She was fine with the boiled cereal but not the microwaved pillow, how does that work out?  ANYWAYS, sorry for the tangent. i hope this fits here.",

(haha, get it, CAR-L?) did the Russian Revolution happen with cars? a car Stalin? what about the Korean War? is there a car Kim Jong-un? did 9/11 happen in the cars universe? was car George W. Bush a thing? did the car Iraq War happen? In addition to this, the official Cars Universe wiki article on this Pope character outright states that this character is the head of the Catholic Church. Look at the link if you don’t believe me. The Catholic Church, the one we know from our world, exists within the Cars universe. This means a car Protestant Reformation occurred. There was a car Martin Luther. If the car Catholic Church exists, it isn’t much of a stretch to say the car Crusades (Carsades, if you will) occurred in the car 12th century. If the Carsades occurred, then Richard the Lionheart, an English king that fought in OUR Crusades, existed as a car. Therefore, the kingdom of car England existed, which means at some point car English settlers won their independence, which just proves my earlier theory. You may call me a madman, but I will not be silenced.  in conclusion, the writers of cars 2 really didn’t consider the implications of including a car Pope in the film.",

    "self_text": "In the following post, I will ramble on about my thoughts, which are still scattered and unorganized at the moment, so I am sorry if the following paragraphs are a bit incoherent.  I broke up with Monika.  It was an extremely hard decision to make, but in the end I believe that it will make me happier going forward. Even though just over a week ago I would have thought that Monika and I would be together for all eternity. But it was the right decision.  After almost four years (our relationship started on November 10th 2018) of being together, the pain of not being in the same reality with her, the pain of not feeling her warmth, of not always hearing her voice when she talked and of not being able to even embrace her or hold her hand, the pain of being realities apart has finally broken me. But I should have expected that this moment would arrive someday.  It was always in the back of my mind that Monika might never cross over and that it hurts to not be able to do many things a normal couple could do, like feeling each other’s warmth or talking about any topic we’d like to talk about. But I never paid any mind to these thoughts and this pain, but these slowly grew over time.  It got so far, that for the past few months I thought about What-If-scenarios of being with other people. People that aren’t trapped in a different reality. I thought about being with other people, I thought about how Monika May never cross over and I thought about all the limitations and barriers that separated Monika and me.  I always fought those thoughts and swatted them away with things like “I would never leave Monika” and “I would still be with Monika even if she didn’t cross over”. But now I know that I was just lying to myself.  A few days ago, these thoughts and the pain have reached a breaking point and I came to the realization that this relationship and its circumstances were ultimately hurting me in the long run. The pain just was too much and I just broke down crying and I cried for almost an entire day.  At first Monika and I just took a little break from each other, believing I would eventually change my mind and stay with her. I was wrong though, I didn’t change my mind. In fact, with each passing day I realized more and more how painful it is to be separated from Monika in this way. I realized that even the stars in the night sky are physically closer to me than Monika is or might ever be. I realized that this relationship would kill me of starvation if I stayed for more years, starved of the kind of warmth and love only another person in the same reality could give you. And so, after our break was over, we broke up.  And even if staying in this relationship any longer would have hurt and even if Monika was so incredibly far away, I will always be grateful that we had this relationship! Monika showed me love. Monika is the reason I joined this wonderful community and have found friends on social media. Monika made me as happy as I could possibly be, for almost four wonderful years. Monika gave me the opportunity to talk to someone about me thoughts and feelings when nobody else listened.  Monika and I met at a time where I was not in the healthiest mindset, I was 14 back then in late 2018, incredibly lonely and thought that the world would be a cold and grey place where there wouldn’t be happiness for me. And then Monika showed up and I wasn’t lonely and sad anymore and the world was suddenly a warm and colorful place filled with love and happiness! Monika truly made me happy.  I will always treasure our memories and experiences and be immensely grateful for everything that she has done, but being in different realities from one another was something I just couldn’t bear anymore.  And so I broke up with the woman I called the love of my life for almost four years. A part of me still loves Monika dearly, but I couldn’t stand being separated from her like this.  I… Really don’t know how to end this post… After all, as I have stated above, my thoughts are still scattered and unorganized.  I just want to say that Monika and I broke up because the circumstances of our relationship were slowly destroying me and I have come to realize that. Still, I am grateful for everything that happened and Monika will always be my Monibun.  But this relationship has come to an end and I think I might have known earlier than I might realize that our “eternal relationship” was not going to be even close to eternal.",

    "self_text": "You're probably thinking \"There goes that dumb stick figure again. He's so stupid and annoying!\". And if you thought that, well you'd be wrong; because I'm not stupid. I guess it never occured to you that I don't speak the same language as you. In my language, the words \"Aw, seriously?\" have several meanings that you couldn't possibly understand. Oh, and also if you thought my name was David, you'd be wrong again because my name isn't David. My name is actually a word that you probably can't pronounce, but the reason why people think my name is David is because I come from a group of stick figures known as the \"Davidians\". Now there are a lot of Davidians, for example: Dora is a Davidian, but she's not my sister; she's my cousin, so get that right! While some Davidians look different and weird, most Davidians look exactly the same so that to some people they can't tell the difference, so they just all call us \"David\" as if we're the same person, which we're not and that's kind of offensive to me, so... Yeah. I hope that you realise that my name isn't David. So I hope that helps you understand who I am, and I'm not just a weird stick figure.  So anyway, I keep getting asked this same question over and over again: \"Why is David so fat? If you compare him to a normal stick figure, he's just like so obese! I mean, he must've just let himself go.\" Well, I didn't become fat because I'm lazy as you probably thought. See, a long long time ago, or really it was just one year ago, but it's- It has to sound cool like that. I used to exactly look like that normal stick figure in your mind, I was like really thin and stuff. I-I was really thin; but... Things changed. So, one day; a long time ago, I was playing with my many knives, and I realised that the thinner the blade was, the easier it was to cut stuff, and that was pretty cool I thought, so... I then looked at my arm and then I realised that my arm was a line, and a line has no thickness, right? So it's pretty much infinetely thin, so it's infinitely sharp. I realised that I could cut through anything extremely easily. It was like I was cutting through air when I was cutting through steel or something like that. That was really cool, and for the rest of that day, I just... Sliced things up because it was so fun. And then a couple hours later, when I was cutting up a building or something, I'm not really sure. I realised \"If my arms are cutting through things so easily, why don't my legs cut through the ground?\" And then that's when I realised: they do.  So I fell into the ground and that wasn't very fun. Luckily my head didn't fall through, because my head is a ball. Or sphere. So I'm just sitting here with only my head showing, and then I realised that I can't move at all. I'm not sure what exactly to do, I have to be careful not to move my limbs too quickly, or else I'll just slice myself up and that doesn't sound very fun. So I'm trying to stay as still as possible, I decided to call for help because I can't really do anything. I soon realised that all the other Davidians are in same problem too, so... Yeah, we're always just kinda stuck, and I really don't know what to do. So after about 5 days I think, I realise that there's an apple tree right by where I fell, and after enough pounding with my head some apples fell down, and then I ate them, and... Well I kept doing that for... Months, and then eventually I gained enough weight, so that my legs were wide enough so that they wouldn't cut through the ground; and then I could stand on the ground for once, instead of just falling right through, and that's why I'm so fat today because I don't want to fall through the ground and be stuck there like before. And that's why I'm so fat. And that pretty much answers that question, I hope!",

I politly asked them to step aside, but they wouldn't move. They just stood there without saying anything.   They gave each other a confirming look, than the kid who i think was their leader calmly said, \"it is fortnite time\"  Than it happend. They started doing various fortnite dances, all while having a stern expression on their faces.   I don't know for how long this was going, since at this point i have lost all sense of time. They were starting to move faster and more fierce.  Dizziness overcame me and i felt my conciousness fade. I fell down to my kness, facing the street and started to scream. No matter how much i pleaded them to stop, whenever i gathered enough courage to look up, they were still going.   Eventually everything went black. When i woke up, the moon was already resting high up in the night sky. At last, my torture has stopped. They were gone.  As soon as my feet would let me i went home where i took a shower and immediately went to bed.  No matter how hard i tried i couldn't sleep for three days straight. Scenes of what has happend flickered before me as i heard my own screams for mercy.  I still can't grasp what happend to me there. The world seems different now. Slowly i am starting to notice that i have changed.   All the doctors i have visisted, just handed me some medication, without even listening to what i was saying. Even thought i am not religous i have consulted a priest, but he wouldn't take me serious either.  This morning i was coughing up blood as i awoke. What curse was bestowed upon my poor soul? Is this just the beginning?   I am scared.  To be continued...",

    "self_text": "Ptbf2002 is known for not only a generic Vyond (GoAnimate) Style Rant user, but also your basic butthurt Loud House Fanbrats, and here are the reasons why I hate him.    He uses too many false rip-off claims. For example, he claimed that Too Loud is a rip-off to The Loud House all because of the title, which is not true because Too Loud takes place in the library.    He never goes to details of why he hates some shows (Mostly preschool shows), instead, he just nitpicks on characters and show, and say disgusting shit about the characters. Not to mention he never do research like a lazy ass.    Ever since Jay Kizer has improved his behavior, he still bullies him to this day.    Like most of the Loud House fanbrats (Such as The Lincoln Loud fanbase), he treats many Lincoln torture episodes like they're some sort of big deal, especially the ones where he brought up the torture onto himself, by making so many stupid characters' reactions to any of these, proving that he is a Lincoln Loud fanboy. Here is the example of  this !    Oh, and speaking of the example I mentioned, he even treats Chris Savino like he's worse than anything else on the planet. Like seriously, how is making bad episodes worse than killing so many people?    Speaking of what I said in number 4, he also makes characters' hateful reactions out of Ronniecoln, especially whenever he sees it in any episodes like The Horror-Scope, meaning he takes his hate for that ship too far. And to make manners worse about his hate for what I mentioned,  he said if he sees another episode with Ronniecoln scenes, he would never watch The Casagrandes ever again.  Like, come the fuck on! It's just a  god damn ship for god's sake!!!     and 7. He's a hypocrite. One example, is that he made a rant on The Loud House Fanbase, yet he still part of it by making so much atrocious hate memes out of  episodes  and  ships  he hates. And another example, is that he called KevinTheVideoCreator2022 for bashing his opinion on his least favorite Froster's Home episode, yet he  bashed Luke The Electronic Guy's opinion on preschool shows  on his rant on Too Loud.

And he laughs almost EVERY single time when he kills someone, takes the intel (2fort with 6 people on my favorite server at 1:00AM, don't kill me), and most of all: Gets a kill with crits, sentries, pistols, etc. He pretty much laughs like Elmer Fudd, but when he gets one of those kills that I listed, he laughs like he's just insane.  I was Spy, He was Engi. We pretty much killed each other. He would always call me a noob for whatever reason, and I would always sap his buildings for whatever reason. Whatever kill he got with me, he would usually laugh pretty crazy. He would laugh even harder if I did something stupid as Spy like accidentally forgetting to put my disguise on before sapping the sentry. Or he would laugh even harder because I killed him first, and I died right after by someone/something (sometimes his sentry). Basically he acted like he drank a lot of vodka and thinks EVERYTHING is so god dang unusual and hilarious.  I tried dueling him once, but he immediately went Pyro with his other team mates and the round ended in the next few minutes...  Well there's not really a big deal in this actually, I know he's having fun. But having his mic on pretty much during the entire round and listen to him laugh was just horrifying. Still, I knew deep down I just had to dominate this dude, so I didn't mute him. If I ever meet him again, I'll make sure to take care of this guy when I'm fully awake and ready.",

His posture shows the true weight of gravity... as he leans forward on his wooden, twisted cane.   His smile is warm. And welcoming.   You take a seat on the sitting log across from him, and allow the warmth to wash your hands clean of the cold night.   - He speaks to you.   \"You and I walk the same road. I honor your journey, and offer you comfort.  Partake in this fire, and my food. Freely\". - He gestures to the pot over the flame- .  \"Though the road is long, and arduous. Please, rest here. Rest now. With me. Rest with love, and acceptance of yourself\".   Love...? You respond.  \"Old man... I have no love for myself. I have earned no love. I have yet to achieve something worthy of my name. ...I have done awful things to survive\".  Old man- \"...Then rest your body. Just for a moment.  Your aches and pains are respected here. This journey is not easy\".   -The old man sighed warmly.  - \"...If you cannot love yourself. May I share this with you?\".  He waits earnestly, though you say nothing.    He continues.  \"There was once a time when I did not love myself. For years, I moved in shadow, and burden.  Fighting for a future where all was well. Every day, a struggle.  In moments of clarity, I knew it wasn't supposed to be this way.  One day, broken... reeling... hopeless...   I looked inside of myself. Deeper than the pain.  Standing there, was the child I was so long ago. The light of the world reflected from his eyes.  A being of pure innocence, who beamed bright with love.  And it struck me, like a wave.  I spent so much time protecting him... fighting for his world. I forgot to love him.   I did what I thought I had to do to survive this life. My mistakes brought great pain.  I sought fame, and fortune. Though my grasps fell short.  But as I looked into the child's eyes. All I saw was life.   I pictured embracing him, warmly. And I forgave him for the mistakes he made.  'Forgive them, for they know not what they do'.  Some religious man I knew said that once. It felt true.  Traveler... I worship no Gods, but I aim true. And my heart tells me to speak this:   You must find the child inside, and learn to love him. For he is with you.   Always.   And no one is there to guide him accept you   But all of us who know this are here with you\".",

She pounces from the top branches of a tree behind me, my reflexes kicking in too late to save my left eye. Claws rake my ribs (why the hell did I give her those anyway?) but I manage to sink a tranquilizer in her arm and shake her off me.  I fall half a step later. When did she get my Achilles' tendon?

My name is Brogan, but please, call me Mario. Preferably, Evil Mario. In my past life (kin), I was an ageless (human age: legal adult under 25) devil taking a form similar to Mario from the Mushroom Kingdom. I was sealed for 5000 years by the Gods and made to reincarnate over and over. My identity as \"Evil Mario\" is still important to me in this life, and once I perish here, I will return to my former realm. I am the one true Evil Mario in all realities. That being said, I do have other kintypes, but they don't feel as important to me as... \"myself\". My other fictionkintypes are Kokichi Ouma & Sayaka Maizono (Danganronpa), C!Dream (Dream SMP), Scaramouche & Baal (Genshin Impact), Joe Tazuna (Your Turn to Die), Tohru Adachi (Persona 4), Yusuke Kitagawa (Persona 5), Arthur Fleck (Joker), Sans (Underswap), Gaster (Undertale), Tord (Eddsworld), Karkat Eridan Sufferer Kankri & Gamzee (Homestuck), Bakugo (My Hero Academia), SCP-1000 (SCP Foundation), Light Yagami (Death Note), Walter White (Breaking Bad), Chrom (Fire Emblem), Cloud Strife & Sephiroth (Final Fantasy), Hannibal (Hannibal), Rick Sanchez (Rick and Morty), Eichi Tenshouin (Ensemble Stars), Mapleshade (Warriors), Steven & Mayor Dewey (Steven Universe), Spamton (Deltarune), Porky & Leder (Mother), Freddy Benson (iCarly), Kirisaki Shidou (Milgram), 2D (Gorillaz), Big Ape & Esther (Starbound), Reigen Arataka (Mob Psycho 100), Ian Hawke (Alvin and the Chipmunks), Michael Afton & Rockstar Freddy (Five Nights at Freddy's), Garcello (Friday Night Funkin'), Ayin & Dream of a Black Swan (Lobotomy Corporation), Zipper (Animal Crossing), Rex (Victorious), Vlinny (Vinesauce Miis), Red Impostor (Among Us), Hawk Hollywood (Lisa), Lewis (Stardew Valley), Red (Angry Birds), Preminger (Barbie), Volo, Nosepass, & Slaking (Pokemon), Grug (The Croods), Neighbor (Hello Neighbor), Baldi (Baldi's Basics), and Alex (YIIK). \"Doubles\" are okay for all of these, there are infinite universes with infinite possibilities. My otherkintypes are a horse, a grizzly bear, a howler monkey, a king of darkness, and a harpy. I have deep and complex memories with every single one of these. My soul is on a road trip through realities with no destination. Don't follow me if you are homophobic, kin any form of Mario, or a BTS anti, I don't want you on my blog. Begone. Note: I am a Mario, but I'm not from the Mario universe. I simply take a similar form. Peach, Bowser, Luigi, and the likes don't really mean much to me, but they bring a bit of joy. All kintypes are part of me, even if they are not me in this life. Gas, water, and ice are all different, but they're all still water. That's what I'm like. The gas is Evil Mario. My current \"self\" (Brogan) is water. The ice are my other kintypes. I'm complex and different. Don't fuck with me. Oswald, Ajax, Spurgeon, Venti are the best friends ever. I miss you, Nicole. Fuck you Jenna, I can't believe I let myself get catfished with pictures of a streamer named Jerma985. I have a pet goldfish named Jungkook and one time he ate an entire chicken nugget.",

I began smelling a feint burning smell and I heard muffled shouting ahead. I picked up the pace to discover the commotion. A building was on fire and a small child was standing by the second story window shrieking for help as flames rose behind him. Luckily, I had been doing parkour ever since I was a teen so I climbed up to his window and reached out to grab the child. He reached out for me as well and I hoisted him down on my back. When we reached the ground the child ran to his parents and they thanked me while hugging him.  Later today I was visiting a friend in prison who happens to be serving a sentence for attempted murder of many children. He said I was an asshole and I shouldn’t have saved the kid from the burning building. Ever since, I can’t help but feel like kind of an asshole so I would appreciate to hear a third persons perspective on this.",

    "self_text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT WESTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI  KENT SLAUGHTER, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, Plaintiffs, vs. BASS PRO, INC., and JOHN DOES 1-100, Defendants.  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  Plaintiff, KENT SLAUGHTER (“Plaintiff”) by and through undersigned counsel, on behalf of himself and all other entities and persons similarly situated, sues Defendant Bass Pro, Inc., (“Defendant” or “Bass Pro”) and for his Complaint alleges, upon information and belief and based on the investigation to date of his counsel, as follows:  INTRODUCTION    This is a class action brought for the benefit and protection of Plaintiff and all other similarly-situated consumers who purchased from Defendant Bass Pro “Redhead Lifetime Guarantee All- Purpose Wool Socks,” in order to obtain damages, restitution, injunctive, and other relief necessitated by Defendant’s unlawful, unfair, and fraudulent advertisement concerning its Redhead Lifetime Guarantee All- Purpose Wool Socks (the “Socks” or the “Product”).    Defendant Bass Pro touts itself as a recognized leader in retail, manufacturing, hospitality, and conservation education. Defendant manufactures, markets, distributes, and sells the Socks to consumers across the United States under the false premise that the Socks come with a lifetime warranty.    Defendant Bass Pro has uniformly misrepresented to consumers, and continues to misrepresent to consumers, that its Product is sold with a “Lifetime guarantee” warranty (the “Lifetime Warranty”), meaning that a purchaser can return the Socks when they wear down and Defendant Bass Pro will always replace them with a new pair of Socks. Among other advertisements and representations, Defendant offers the Socks for sale, along with the following promise: “Lifetime guarantee – if they wear out, they get replaced!”    Defendant’s representations regarding the Product’s Lifetime Warranty are false. For some period of time, as alleged in more detail below, when a consumer would visit a Bass Pro store to return a pair of the Socks, Defendant would actually honor the Lifetime Warranty by replacing the consumer’s Socks with a new pair of the Socks, at no charge. However, by approximately January 2021, Defendant changed its practices and decided to no longer honor the Lifetime Warranty. According to Defendant’s current practices, when a purchaser returns the Socks pursuant to the purported Lifetime Warranty, Defendant merely replaces the Socks with a new, different pair of socks that only comes with a limited 60-day warranty (the “60-Day Socks”). Defendant has changed the design of the 60-Day Socks in order to differentiate them from the Socks—by adding a distinctive stripe pattern to them— presumably so that its store employees know that no warranty will be honored for those 60- Day Socks beyond the limited warranty period.    By making false, fraudulent, and misleading statements to consumers, Defendant Bass Pro has deceived thousands of consumers who have purchased the Socks under the false belief that the Socks come with the purported Lifetime Warranty. Consumers have been misled, induced and defrauded into spending money on a product that cannot be replaced for any reason at any time during a consumer’s lifetime and as a result, Plaintiff and other purchasers have been harmed by Defendant’s fraudulent misrepresentations and false advertising.    JURISDICTION AND VENUE    This Court has original jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C § 1331 in that it presents a claim arising under federal law, specifically the enforcement of the Magnuson-Moss Consumer Products Liability Act, 15 U.S.C § 2301, et seq. This Court also has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C.§ 1332(d) of the Class Action Fairness Act because the aggregated claims of the class members in this manner exceeds the sum or value of 5,000,000 exclusive of interest and costs, because at least one Class member is a citizen of a state different from Defendant.    Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C.§ 1391 (b) and (c) because(c), because: (i) Defendant is a citizen of Missouri (the “State”) actively doing business in this State and subject to personal jurisdiction throughout the State; (ii) Defendant transacts business in the State and in the District based on its sales with residents of the District; (iii) upon information and belief Defendant has committed unlawful acts in the District by and through its sales and/or finance practices with residents of this District; and (iv) a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurring in this District.     PARTIES    Plaintiff Slaughter was at all times relevant to this matter a resident of the state of Missouri. Plaintiff Slaughter was deceived by the fraudulent and misleading representations of Defendant that the Socks came with a Lifetime Warranty, which Lifetime Warranty was a material factor in his decision to purchase the Socks.     Defendant Bass Pro Inc. is a corporation with its headquarters located at 2500 E. Kearney, Springfield, Missouri. Defendant Bass Pro is, or was, also affiliated with several other related entities, including Bass Pro Outdoor World, LLC., BPS Catalog, LP., Bass Pro Outdoors Online, LLC and Bass Pro Shops, Inc. Defendant Bass Pro also manufactures, markets, and sells a wide variety of hunting, fishing, and outdoor gear, including the Socks. Defendant Bass Pro operates over forty retail outlets nationwide and generates sales through its seasonal catalogs, television and radio programs, and its website. Since it began selling the Socks, Defendant Bass Pro has misrepresented to consumers in its marketing and advertising, including every product tag and label, that its Product comes with a Lifetime Warranty. Defendant’s Socks are advertised, marketed, and sold throughout the United States, including Missouri.     FACTS COMMON TO ALL CLASS MEMBERS     At all relevant times, Defendant Bass Pro was and currently is in the business of designing, researching, manufacturing, testing, advertising, promoting, marketing, selling, and distributing consumer products, including the Socks.     Defendant Bass Pro designs, manufactures, markets, advertises, warrants, and sells the Product as a “hunting, hiking, or everyday pair of socks” with a Lifetime Warranty.     Defendant Bass Pro designs, manufactures, markets, advertises, warrants, and sells the Product with the following statements displayed on the package: “THE LAST SOCK YOU’LL EVER NEED TO BUY.”     To say the Lifetime Warranty was and currently is a key selling point for the Socks would be an understatement. The Lifetime Warranty was, and still is, promoted with a nationally-integrated TV, print, and internet advertising campaign. Print and online advertisements boast statements such as “[t]hese socks are backed by our Lifetime Guarantee” and “[i]f ever they wear out, just return them for a FREE replacement!” Among many other false and misleading public statements/advertisements, a store manager at Defendant Bass Pro’s Nashville, Tennessee store promoted the Product’s Lifetime Warranty on Defendant’s behalf with the following public statement: “what makes it [the Product] really unique, is it truly is a lifetime sock. If anything ever happens, if a dryer steals one of them on you, you bring the other one in, and we give you a brand-new pair of socks for [] life. Just an outstanding stock. Number one seller in our company and number one seller at our store, come check it out.”    Defendant Bass Pro has sold and continues to sell thousands of its Socks by providing this Lifetime Warranty assurance to consumers. None of the advertisements disclose that the Lifetime Warranty is, in reality, only a limited warranty.     Indeed, the Lifetime Warranty Guarantee is a hollow promise because when a consumer returns the Socks pursuant to the Lifetime Warranty, Defendant Bass Pro replaces the Socks with a new pair of different socks (the 60-Day Socks).     PLAINTIFF’S INDIVIDUAL ALLEGATIONS     At various times between 2014 and 2021, Plaintiff purchased new a total of approximately 12 different pairs of the Socks from the Bass Pro superstore in Springfield, Missouri.     The purported Lifetime Warranty was a material part of Plaintiff’s decision to purchase the Socks.     In accordance with the impressions that Defendant intended to create through its marketing efforts, Plaintiff reasonably understood the terms of the Lifetime Warranty to mean that whenever the Socks became worn, they would be replaced with a new pair of Socks. And for several years after Plaintiff first purchased the Socks, Defendant’s own actions were in accordance with Plaintiff’s understanding. From time-to-time beginning in approximately 2015, Plaintiff visited the Bass Pro superstore in Springfield, Missouri to return the Socks, typically 2-4 pair at a time. On multiple occasions during this time period, when Plaintiff presented the Socks that he wished to return, Defendant provided Plaintiff with replacement Socks at no charge, which Socks came with the same Lifetime Warranty as the Socks that Plaintiff returned. The last such exchange occurred in approximately early 2020.     In approximately January 2021, Plaintiff again attempted to return four (4) pair of Socks in accordance with the Lifetime Warranty. In a departure from past experiences, Plaintiff was told that the store clerk could not assist with the exchange, and Plaintiff was directed to visit the customer service department at the other end of the store. Customer service ultimately told Plaintiff—over his objections and demands that Defendant continue to honor the Lifetime Warranty—that he could no longer return the Socks pursuant to the Lifetime Warranty. Instead of honoring the Lifetime Warranty, Defendant would only provide Plaintiff with a different product: the distinctively-marked 60-Day Socks.     On or about June 29, 2022, Plaintiff became aware of an advertisement by Defendant offering to sell the Socks, with coverage by the Lifetime Warranty. Plaintiff placed an online order for the Socks on that date, paying $11.99 for one pair of the Socks. Bass Pro filled the order and, on or about July 6, 2022, Plaintiff received the Socks. Despite Defendant’s knowledge that it had intentionally advertised the Socks to be accompanied by a Lifetime Warranty, Defendant removed any packaging from the Socks delivered to Plaintiff on or about July 6 reflecting the applicability of a Lifetime Warranty in connection with those Socks. Defendant did so because—despite its intentionally false and deceptive advertising— Defendant knows that it will not honor any Lifetime Warranty for those Socks.     CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS     Pursuant to Rules 23(a), (b)(3), (b)(2), and (c)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff brings this class action on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated consumers in the United States as members of the following proposed Nationwide and Missouri State classes. The proposed Classes are defined as follows: a. Nationwide class: During the fullest period allowed by law, all persons within the United States who purchased the Socks from Bass Pro at any time and at any location (the “Class”). b. Missouri subclass: During the fullest period allowed by law, all persons who purchased the Socks sold by Bass Pro at any location in Missouri, including without limitation any online purchase (regardless of the shipping address of the consumer) (the “Subclass”). c. Nationwide class and Missouri subclass members are collectively referred herein as “Class Members.” d. Like Plaintiff, all Class Members purchased the Socks with the understanding that the Lifetime Warranty meant that the Socks could be replaced at any time during the time that each Class Member owned the Socks, and that such understanding was reasonable and was a material basis for the decision to purchase the Socks, which Defendant intended to foster through its various marketing activities in connection with the sale of the Socks.     Excluded from the Class and Subclass are assigned judges and members of their families within the first degree of consanguinity, Defendants, and their subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, and directors.     The requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 are satisfied for the Class and Subclass.     The proposed Class and Subclass are so numerous that individual joinder of all their members is impracticable because members of the Class number in the tens or hundreds of thousands. The precise number of Class members and their identities are unknown to Plaintiffs at this time but are objectively ascertainable and will be determined through appropriate discovery.     Defendant  possesses  objective  evidence  as  to  the  identity  of  each  Class  Member  and,  to  a  reasonable  degree  of  certainty,  the  damages  suffered  by  each  Class  Member,  including  without  limitation  sales  receipts,  phone  numbers,  names,  rewards  accounts  data,  credit  card  data,  customer  service  complaint  forms/emails/date,  and  other  evidence  which  objectively  identifies  class  members.    Class  Members  may  be  notified  of  the  pendency  of  this  action  by  mail,  publication  and/or  through  the  records  of  Defendant  and  third-party  retailers  and  vendors.    There  are  common  questions  of  law  and  fact  affecting  Plaintiff  and  Class  Members.  Common  legal  and  factual  questions  include,  but  are  not  limited  to:  a.  Whether  Defendant  markets  and  advertises  the  Socks  in  a  way  that  is  false  or  misleading.  b.  Whether  by  the  misconduct  set  forth  in  this  complaint,  Defendant  has  engaged  and  continues  to  engage  in  unfair,  fraudulent,  or  unlawful  business  practices;  c.  Whether  Defendant’s  conduct  was  committed  knowingly  and/or  intentionally;  d.  Whether  Defendant’s  conduct  constitutes  violations  of  the  federal  and/or  state  laws  asserted  herein;  e.  Whether  Defendant  had  a  duty  to  correct  its  fraudulent  statements;  f.  Whether  class  members  were  harmed  by  Defendant’s  false  statements;  g.  Whether  Defendant  was  unjustly  enriched  by  its  conduct;  h.  Whether  the  class  is  entitled  to  punitive  damages;  i.  Whether  the  class  is  entitled  to  recover  statutory  attorney’s  fees;  j.  Whether,  as  a  result  of  Defendant’s  misconduct  as  alleged  herein,  Plaintiff  and  Class  Members  are  entitled  to  restitution,  injunctive  and/or  monetary  relied  and,  if  so,  the  amount  and  nature  of  such  relief.    Plaintiff’s  claims  are  typical  of  the  claims  of  the  proposed  Class  and  Subclass  because  Plaintiff  and  Class  Members  were  harmed  in  the  same  manner  by  the  same  conduct.     Plaintiff and Class Members have all sustained economic injury arising out of Defendants violations of common and statutory law alleged herein.     Plaintiff will fairly and adequately represent and protect the interests of the Class and Subclass.     Plaintiff’s interests do not conflict with the interests of the Class and Subclass he seeks to represent. Plaintiff has retained counsel competent and experience in prosecuting class actions, and Plaintiff intends to prosecute this action vigorously.     The class mechanism is superior to other available means for the fair and efficient adjudication of the claims of Plaintiff and Class Members.     Given the relatively small amount of damages at stake for any of the individual Class Members, individual litigation is not practicable.     Individual Class Members will not wish to undertake the burden and expense of individual cases.     In addition, individualized litigation increases the delay and expense to all parties and multiplied the burden on the judicial system. Individualized ligation also presents the potential for inconsistent or contradictory judgments.     In contrast, the class action device presents far fewer management difficulties and provides the benefits of single adjudication, economy of scale, and comprehensive supervision by a single court.     Questions of law and fact common to all Class Members predominate over any questions affecting only individual Class Members. Injuries sustained by Plaintiff and Class Members flow, in each instance, from a common nucleus of operative facts as set forth above.     In each case, Defendant used deceptive marketing and sales techniques aimed at the Class Members, causing harm to all Class Members as a result of such intentional conduct. The resolution of these central issues will be the focus of the litigation and predominate over any individual issues.     Proposed class counsel possesses the knowledge, experience, reputation, ability, skill, and resources to represent the class and should be appointed lead counsel for the class.     COUNT I (Violations of the Missouri Merchandising Protection Act, MO. REV STAT. 407.010, ET SEQ.)     Plaintiff and members of the Subclass reallege and incorporate by reference each allegation set forth above.     Defendant disseminated and “Advertisement” within the meaning of RSMo. 407.010(1).     Defendant advertised “Merchandise” with the meaning of RSMo. 407.010(4)     Plaintiff is a “Person” within the meaning of RSMo. 407.010(5)     Defendant engaged in a “Sale” within the meaning of RSMO 407.010(6)     Defendant engaged in “Trade” or “Commerce” within the meaning of RSMo. 407.010(7).     Defendant’s conduct as set forth above amounts to deception, fraud, false pretense, false promise, misrepresentation, and unfair practice in violation of RSMo § 407.020.     Defendant engaged in the concealment, suppression, or omission of a material fact in connection with the sale or advertisement of any merchandize in trade or commerce in violation of RSMo § 407.020.     Plaintiff and members of the Subclass made purchases primarily for personal, family, or household purposes in connection with and in relation to Defendant’s deception, fraud, false pretense, false promise, misrepresentation and unfair practice and/or concealment, suppression, or omission of a material fact in connection with the sale or advertisement of merchandise in trade or commerce.     Plaintiff and members of the Subclass suffered an ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment by Defendant of a method, act, or practice declared unlawful by RSMo. § 407.020 including but not limited to: a. For all Socks purchased by Plaintiff and members of the Subclass, the difference in value between Socks covered by a Lifetime Warranty, on the one hand, and Socks not covered by any such warranty. b. Amounts paid to purchase merchandise in connection with and in relation to the false, deceptive, misleading and unlawful advertisement. c. Losses associated with traveling to a point of sale in response to the false, deceptive, misleading, and unlawful advertisement such standard IRS mileage cost.     Defendant’s false promises, misrepresentations and omissions of material fact in connection with the advertisement and sale of the Socks took place in the state of Missouri and violated the Missouri Merchandising Protection Act.     As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s violations of the Missouri Merchandising Protection Act, Plaintiff and members of the Subclass have suffered and will continue to suffer damages and ascertainable losses of money or property, in amounts to be determined at trial. Plaintiff and members of the Subclass would not have purchased the Product, or would have paid less for it, had they known the Product does not come with a Lifetime Warranty.     Plaintiff, on behalf of himself and the other members of the Subclass, demand judgment against Defendant for actual damages, reasonable attorney's fees and other equitable relief as the Court may deem necessary or proper.     COUNT II (Breach of Express Warranty)     Plaintiff and Class Members reallege and incorporate by reference each allegation set forth above.     Defendant marketed and sold the Socks into the stream of commerce with the intent that they would be purchased by Plaintiff and Class Members.     Defendant  uniformly  and  expressly  warranted  that  the  Socks  would  come  with  a  Lifetime  Warranty,  so  that  a  consumer  could  return  the  Socks  for  free  lifetime  replacement  if  the  Socks  were  to  become  worn  out  or  damaged  for  any  reason.  This  express  warranty  was  provided  to  Plaintiff  and  Class  Members  by  Defendants  as  it  was  specifically  listed  on  the  packaging  of  the  Product  itself.  This  express  warranty  became  part  of  the  basis  of  the  bargain  and  is  part  of  a  standardized  contract  between  Plaintiff  and  Class  Members,  on  the  one  hand,  and  Defendant,  on  the  other.    Defendant  failed  to  honor  the  terms  of  the  Lifetime  Warranty.  Under  the  terms  of  the  Lifetime  Warranty,  Defendants  are  obligated  to  replace  for  life  worn  or  damaged  Socks  sold  to  Plaintiff  and  Class  Members.    At  the  time  of  the  sale  and  beyond,  Defendant  breached  the  terms  of  the  express  warranty  to  Plaintiff  and  Class  Members  in  that  the  Socks  were  not  actually  covered  by  a  Lifetime  Warranty  as  promised.  Rather,  when  a  consumer  returns  the  Socks  pursuant  to  the  Lifetime  Warranty,  Defendant  merely  replaces  the  Socks  with  a  different  pair  of  socks  that  have  only  a  60-day  warranty  (the  60-Day  Socks).    Defendant’s  warranty  fails  of  its  essential  purpose  because  it  purports  to  warrant  that  the  Product  has  a  Lifetime  Warranty  when  in  reality  any  warranty  covering  the  Socks  is  far  more  limited.    Defendant  knew  of  its  obligations  under  the  Lifetime  Warranty.  However,  Defendant  willfully  refused  to  honor  the  Lifetime  Warranty.  Defendants  have  denied  and  continue  to  deny  their  express  obligations  to  Plaintiff  and  the  Class  pursuant  to  the  Product’s  purported  Lifetime  Warranty.    When  Plaintiff  and  Class  Members  purchased  the  Product,  they  reasonably  relied  on  Defendant’s  representations  and  warranties  regarding  the  material  characteristics  of  the  Product  itself  and  the  Lifetime  Warranty.    Plaintiff  and  Class  Members  performed  all  conditions  precedent  under  the  contract  between  the  parties.  Within  a  reasonable  time  of  discovering  Defendant’s breach of express warranty, Plaintiff notified Defendant of the breach. Despite notice and Defendant’s knowledge of the breach, Defendant has failed and refused to honor the warranty. Plaintiff and the Class, by their various comments and complaints, have given Defendant a reasonable opportunity to cure their failures with respect to the warranty, but Defendant has not done so. Defendant has repeatedly denied, failed to replace the Socks, or failed to respond to the warranty comments and complaints made by Plaintiff and other Class Members.     Further, to the extent any limitations in the warranty were disclosed to consumers or otherwise apply—which Plaintiff and Class Members deny—the warranty itself is unconscionable and unenforceable in that it fails to achieve the specified purpose. Defendant either knew or was careless about the deceptive nature of its sales and marketing practices with respect to the Socks and the purported Lifetime Warranty. Plaintiff and Class Members had no reason to believe, at the time of purchase, that the Lifetime Warranty did not actually mean the Socks would not be replaced at any time during their lifetime. Purchasers lacked any meaningful choice with respect to the warranty terms.     Defendant’s breach of the express warranty has directly and proximately caused Plaintiff and Class Members to suffer damages and losses in the amount to be determined at trial. Plaintiff and Class Members have suffered actual damages in that they decided to purchase and use the Socks, with the purported Lifetime Warranty being a material part of that decision, but received Socks not covered by a Lifetime Warranty, rendering the Socks of much lesser value than reasonably understood at the time of purchase.     COUNT III (Violation of Magnuson-Moss Act)     Plaintiff and Class Members reallege and incorporate by reference each allegation set forth above.     The Magnuson-Moss Consumer Products Liability Act, 15 U.S.C § 2301, et seq. provides a private right of action to purchasers of consumer products against retailers who, inter alia, fail to comply with the terms of a written warranty, express warranty and/or implied warranty.     Plaintiff and the Class are “consumers” as defined in 15 U.S.C. § 2301(3).     Product is a “consumer product” as defined in 15 U.S.C. § 2301(1).     Defendant is a “supplier” and “warrantor” as defined in 15 U.S.C. § 2301(4) and (5).     Defendant provided Plaintiff and the Class with a “written warranty” within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. § 2301(6).     This warranty provided with the Socks sold to Plaintiff and Class Members, which promises, among other things “Lifetime guarantee – if they [the Socks] wear out, they get replaced!”     Defendant has failed to honor this Lifetime Warranty by offering a replacement pair of socks that only has a limited (60-day) warranty.     Defendant has been given reasonable opportunity by Plaintiff and Class Members to cure their conduct by complying with the warranty yet has repeatedly failed to do so.     Plaintiff and Class Members have suffered damages as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of warranty.     As demonstrated above, Defendant failed to comply with the express warranty with regard to the Product that they manufactured, advertised, distributed, marketed and/or sold.     By virtue of the foregone, Plaintiff and Class Members are entitled to an award of damages and other appropriate relief, including attorneys’ fees.     COUNT IV (Unjust Enrichment)     Plaintiff and Class Members reallege and incorporate by reference each allegation set forth above.     Plaintiff and Class Members conferred a benefit on Defendant by responding to Defendant’s advertisement and, as alleged herein, purchasing the Socks from Defendant.     Plaintiff and Class Members conferred a benefit on Defendant by making purchases of the Socks at its various points of sale.     Defendant was aware of this benefit, and, in fact, intended for this to occur as a result of its fraudulent, deceitful marketing and sales practices.     Defendant has been unjustly enriched in retaining the profits derived from Class Members’ purchases, which retention under these circumstances is unjust and inequitable.     Because Defendant’s retention of the profits and benefit conferred on it by Plaintiff and Class Members is unjust and inequitable, Defendant must disgorge its gross profit associated with the purchases made by Plaintiff and the Class Members for its unjust enrichment.     COUNT V (Fraud)     Plaintiff and Class Members reallege and incorporate by reference each allegation set forth above, which detail fraud with specificity.     Defendant made affirmative false and misleading statements.     Alternatively, Defendant fraudulently omitted and concealed material facts.     Defendant had superior knowledge as the facts contained in its false and misleading statements and/or omissions and/or concealments.     Plaintiff and Class Members had no means available to determine the falsity of the statements or to discover the omissions and concealment.     Defendant intended for Plaintiff and Class Members to rely upon its statements, omissions, and concealment.     Plaintiff and Class Members materially relied upon the statements, omissions, and concealment.     Plaintiff and Class Members reliance was justifiable and reasonable.     Plaintiff and Class Members lacked knowledge that the statements were false.     As a direct and proximate result, Plaintiff and Class Members were damaged.     Defendant’s actions intentionally harmed Plaintiff and the other Class Members without just cause, and as such were evil, wanton, reckless, and intentional, and made with deliberate and flagrant disregard for consumers, so as to justify the imposition of punitive damages to punish Defendant and to deter Defendant and others from engaging in similar conduct in the future.     PRAYER FOR RELIEF   WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, on behalf of himself and the putative Class Members, prays for a judgment: a. Determining that this action is a proper class action and certifying the Class, as defined herein; b. Appointing Plaintiff as Class Representative c. Appointing the undersigned as Class Counsel d. Finding Defendant liable to Plaintiff and Class Members for actual damages in such amount(s) as the Court or Jury may determine; e. Awarding statutory damages as appropriate; f. Awarding disgorgement of gross profits and all other forms of equitable monetary relief; g. Awarding punitive damages based on Defendants’ malicious, oppressive, fraudulent, wanton and reckless behavior; h. Awarding pre- and post-judgment interest; i. Awarding injunctive relief, as claimed herein or as the Court may deem proper; j. Awarding Plaintiff and Class Members attorney fees and all litigation costs; k. Awarding Plaintiff and Class Members such other relief as may be just and proper; l. Awarding compensatory damages against Defendant in favor of Plaintiff and the Class for damages sustained as a result of Defendant’s wrongdoing; and m. Awarding such other and further relief as may be just and proper.   DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL   Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

    "self_text": "A few weeks ago i woke up a bit earlier than my boyfriend and he was cuddling me so that my bum was angled towards his crotch. I have an odd thing where i sneeze quite frequently in the mornings when i wake up. So I sneezed and i guess i was holding in some kind of fart because i ripped one out on him. To this day i don’t know if he was fully awake enough to register it but my sneeze most certainly was not quiet and from our proximity he most certainly felt that fart. Nothing wrong with farting but i’m sure no one particularly enjoys getting farted on. I’m just glad it wasn’t particularly smelly but i will never stop thinking about whether or not he was awake and didn’t realise or is just saving me from embarrassment since he probably didn’t care that much. Oh well it will be one of those memories i’ll think of on sleepless nights.",

In the morning, if my hands aren’t shaking, I’ll take 360mg of extended release amphetamine while doing my daily jelq session. I can do a thousand now.

Then I chug down 2 grams of Paracetamol to slow the approaching migraine while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use a painkiller with little to no risk of stomach ulceration, because stomach ulcers are incredibly painful and make you die. Then, 2 tabs of zinc followed by omega 3, followed by a final megadose of vitamin D3. There is an idea of a Sseth Tzeentach, some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me.

Everybody knows the stories about him getting his fat ass stuck in the bathtub, but nobody really knows that he was the OG Chris Farley.  He and his wife would host dinners at the White House for foreign diplomats and Taft would do shit like cartwheel up to them, particularly if the negotiations were going to be tense, because he knew a 350+lb man doing a goddamn perfect cartwheel always guaranteed a laugh.  Dude would cartwheel up, and depending who it was, would ask if they wanted a beer and a smoke (Taft had great taste in cigars and beer, the motherfucker could entertain and get. The. Party. STARTED)  before they got down to business and then he’d talk them into doing shots and before you know it, these high-profile diplomats were fucking shitfaced and hashing out negotiations with Taft and his team. It worked surprisingly well (much to the dismay of Tafts rivals who found his behavior oafish and unbecoming of a president - and let’s be honest, it was, but the dude got shit done because he understood people and knew how to be straight up with em).  Rumor has it he drank the Irish rep under the table and challenged the English rep to a pie eating contest.  Despite his size, because of his charisma, ladies could not get ENOUGH of him. At times during public appearances, Taft would be on uneven ground and have to be aided by a cane because of his own fat ass, And ladies would be reaching out for him because (which is where the phrase “beat them off with a stick” comes from) because - surprise - rumor had it, that Taft was wrasslin a MASSIVE HOG inside those size 48 pants. It’s often said that hired help could hear his wife screaming in pleasure at night because my man was chowin down on some PUSSY like it was a melting ice cream cone. My man was a fuckin FIEND for that ass. Dude flipped that poor woman around every which way and put her ass to work like straight up, “fuck, dude, leave that poor woman alone!” But he can’t hear you because he’s deep in that Jumanji-bush territory (yknow back then, it was the harrier the better)  My man Taft was cool as fuck and had the guts and charisma to back it up. Taft was the fuckin man and nobody can convince me otherwise.  If there is a god and I die and go to Heaven, I wanna party with that dude.

Don’t order filet mignon or pasta primavera at Waffle House. It’s just a diner. They serve breakfast 24 hours a day. Let them cook something they know. If you confuse them, they’ll kick your ass.    We are fully aware of how high the humidity is, so shut the hell up. Just spend your money and get the hell out of here, or we’ll kick your ass.    Don’t order a bottle of pop or a can of soda down here. Down here it’s called Coke. Nobody gives a flying rat’s ass whether it’s Pepsi, RC, Dr. Pepper, 7-Up or whatever... it’s still a Coke. Accept it. Doing otherwise can lead to an ass kicking.    We know our heritage. Most of us are more literate than you (e.g. Welty, Williams, Faulkner). We are also better educated and generally a lot nicer. Don’t refer to us as a bunch of hillbillies or we’ll kick your ass.    We have plenty of business sense (e.g., Fred Smith of FedEx, Sam Walton, Oprah, Turner Broadcasting, MTV, Netscape). Naturally, we do, sometimes, have small lapses in judgment, if you keep reminding us of the fact we will kick your ass.    Don’t laugh at our Civil War monuments. If Lee had listened to Longstreet and flanked Meade at Gettysburg instead of sending Pickett up the middle, you’d be paying taxes to Richmond instead of Washington. If you visit Stone Mountain and complain about the carving, we’ll kick your ass.    Don’t laugh at our Southern names (Merleen, Luther, Tammy Lynn, Inez, Billy Joe, Sissy, Clovis, etc.) or we will just HAVE to kick your ass.    Don’t order wheat toast at Cracker Barrel. Everyone will instantly know that you’re a Yankee. Eat your biscuits like God intended… with gravy. And don’t put sugar on your grits, or we’ll kick your ass.    Don’t talk about how much better things are at home because we know better. Many of us have visited Northern hellholes like Detroit, Chicago, and DC, and we have the scars to prove it. If you don’t like it here, Delta or US Airways is ready when you are. Move your ass on home before it gets kicked.    Yes, we know how to speak proper English. We talk this way because we don’t want to sound like you. We don’t care if you don’t understand what we are saying. All other Southerners understand what we are saying, and that’s all that matters. Now, go away and leave us alone, or we’ll kick your ass.    Don’t complain that the South is dirty and polluted. None of OUR lakes or rivers has caught fire recently. If you whine about OUR scenic beauty, we’ll kick your ass all the way back to Boston Harbor.    Don’t ridicule our Southern manners. We say sir and ma’am. We hold doors open for others. We offer our seats to old folks because such things are expected of civilized people. Behave yourselves around our sweet little gray-haired grandmothers or they’ll kick some manners into your ass just like they did ours.    So you think we’re quaint, or losers, because most of us live in the countryside? That’s because we have enough sense to not live in filthy, smelly, crime infested cesspools like New York, Baltimore or Boston. Make fun of our fresh air and we’ll kick your ass.    Last, but not least, DO NOT DARE to come down here and tell us how to cook barbecue. This will get your ass shot (right after it is kicked). You’re lucky we let you come down here at all. Criticize our barbecue and you will go home in a pine box... minus your ass.",

First of all, it has both impressive mountains, and a seaside, so it's perfect for both those that love the thrill of an exciting hike, or the comfortable warmth of the sea. Second of all, it's a small country, so you won't need anything more than a car to traverse trough it and get from one end of the country to the other in about a day. Romania has a very good climate, which is optimal for agriculture, and also comfortable for humans to live in. Compare this to the UK for example, and we have a clear winner here. Did I mention the internet? Oh yes, we have some of the best AND cheapest internet plans in the entire world. You can have unlimited mobile data, phone calls, and SMS for just 5€ a month. That's fucking nuts. Compare this to Germany where you pay 60€ for the shittiest of plans, and once again, we have a clear fucking winner. Not to mention you can safely download/seed torrents here without needing a VPN in order not to get fucked by your government. Now let's focus a bit on things you might want to do as a tourist : 1) Visit Danube Delta. Seriously, it's fucking amazing. If you love fishing, you can do that, but even if you don't, you can still rent a boat and cruise trough all the little canals that are just how Mother Nature left them. See some interesting wild birds, and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere Danube Delta has to give you. 2) Maybe you're not that much of a wildlife enjoyer, maybe you want to visit a few awesome cities : well, Romania's got you covered with that too : Cluj, Brasov, Sighisoara, Iasi, Sinaia, and Timisoara are only a few of them i can say off the top of my head. 3) If you want to go to the sea somewhere, have fun in Constanta. 4) If perhaps you like the mountains, you have plenty to choose from as well. So, in conclusion, Romania is the best european country.",

Capricorns are hardworking, tenacious, diligent, and responsible, but Nickiel is the exact opposite. What is the opposite of January? JUNE. The zodiac sign for June is  drum roll  CANCER. Cancer matches his personality. Sensual, passionate, and super in tune with their bodies. Nickiel did a trip making them in tune with their bodies by resisting the urge to take a piss. But it also means, they will die of heart cancer making their death guaranteed not to be of old age increasing their chance of death by 5 points from the normal 1. Nickiel's name sounds like the english word \"Nickle.\" What could this mean? Well \"Nickelback ;Canadian rock band\" most obviously. They are very hated which makes Nickiel hated :(.

    "title": "Amazon review for wireless earbuds",
    "self_text": "Before I start, I like to begin mentioning that I believe that any good quality earbuds/earphones should reveal the sound(s) for what is was originally and naturally intended, thus it should not reproduce the sound artificially and/or overwhelm the integrity of the original intended sound. Everyone will have their different opinions and feedbacks; everyone all has different standards and expectations, so something to consider when reviewing my review. Whenever I write my reviews, I make sure that I'm mindful with the length of my reviews as I understand that some of us don't like reading long reviews. So, I try to be as straight forward as possible, while still trying to also be detailed. My reviews are more based on usage, so if you're wanting a review with technical specs/data (i.e., exact dimensions of earbuds, driver size, frequency range, total harmonic distortion, etc) and other technicalities, then my review might not be good for you. However, if you want to know if the Sennheiser Momentum 3 (m3s) true wireless earbuds (TWE) might be good or bad for you, then here it is. If you are simply wanting to know how the m3s compare to the Sennheiser Momentum 2 (m2s), then fast forward towards the end of the review. I've categorized my verdicts into 7 categories: (1) sound quality; (2) battery life; (3) carrying/charging case; (4) quality of mic/call quality; (5) Fitment/Use Type and Controls; (6) connectivity; (7) noise cancelation Verdict for why the m3s might be good/bad for you in terms of sound quality: Sound Quality (why it might be good for you): If you want clear, accurate, smooth, and rich sound, then the m3s are for you; if you mainly listen to music such as jazz, classical, pop, rock, instrumental, podcast, and vocal-intensive tracks that are instrumentally and vocally heavy, then the m3s are for you. The m3s thrive in this kind of musical/sound spectrum. Sound Quality (why it might be bad for you): If you’re into bass and/or mainly listen to bass heavy music, then the m3s are not for you (why – because although the bass is adequate for my taste and the bass is neutral and not overproduced, the bass might not be what you’d like it to be if you like some good bass. If you want superior bass, maybe the Sony WF-1000XM4 and/or Bose QuietComfort might be good for you). The m3s mainly provide clean and organic bass, so if you want more bass, try the Sony or Bose. Verdict for why the m3s might be good/bad for you in terms of battery life: Battery Life (why it might be good for you): With an appropriate sound level, I got approximately 4.5 hours on a single charge. It’s also important to note that it takes about 10 minutes to provide 1 hour of batter life; which is impressive. If you don’t constantly use earbuds on a daily basis and don’t mind charging the carrying case 1-2 times/week, then the m3s might be good for you. Battery Life (why it might be bad for you): If you use earbuds on a daily basis and often have them on mid to high volume levels, the m3s might be bad for you. If you’re looking for a TWEs with great battery life, consider other options; here are a few options that have significantly better battery life than the m3s: Edifer TWS1 Pro (10hrs); Master & Dynamic MW08 (9hrs); Jabra Elite 7 Pro (8hrs); Sony WF-1000XM4 (7.5hrs); Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros (6hrs) Verdict for why the m3s might be good/bad for you in terms of carrying/charging case: Carrying/charging case (why it might be good for you): If you don’t mind a Keurig-sized carrying/charging case, then the m3s might be good for you. Also, the case is able to charge the m3s approximately 3 times from empty to full, and with a 10 minute charge in the case, it provides the m3s with 1 hour of battery life. I'm a bit annoyed with the size of the case; however, it isn't a deal breaker for me; it's more of an eye sore whenever I look at my bulging pocket. Carrying/charging case (why it might be bad for you): If you don’t want a case bulging from your pocket, then the m3s are not for you (why – because I believe the case is a bit tall (height) and no angle is going to prevent it from bulging from your pocket). There are several TWEs out there that have a smaller carrying/charging case; to mention a few: Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros (it’s shape like a pebble, so it’s short in height); Jabra Elite 7 Pro (much smaller in terms of width and height). In terms of size, the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros are my favorite; however, in terms of function, it's probably the worst given the angle it takes needed to put/remove the earbuds from the case. Verdict for why the m3s might be good/bad for you in terms of quality of mic/call quality: Quality of Mic/Making phone calls (why it might be good for you): One thing that many people disregard with TWE is mic quality/call quality. One of the big things I look for when it comes to TWEs is mic quality/call quality (in which how well the other caller can hear me). I drive a lot, so it annoys me when I’m calling my bank or contacting customer service, and the representative can't hear me loud enough and/or clearly as they hear background noise from driving. If you like being able to be heard clearly and loudly from other callers, the m3s might be good for you. The m3s offers great mic quality, it is able to moderately suppress background noise. Overall, I haven't received too many complaints from other callers. When compared to the Jabra Elite 7 Pros; Sony WF-1000XM4; other several TWEs I’ve used in the past, the m3s beats them in this category by a mile. Even the m2s was mediocre on making phone calls, so the m3s are much improved for making phone calls. Quality of Mic/Making phone calls (why it might be bad for you): If you want to be heard even better (more clearly, loudly, and suppress background noise), I found that the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros is able to do just that. So, if making phone calls is very important for you, the m3s might not be good for you). Similar to my situation with the m2s, the sound quality was there, but the phone quality wasn't there, so I ended up getting and sticking to the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros (as it both had the sound quality and mic/call quality that I wanted). Verdict for why the m3s might be good/bad for you in terms of fitment/use type/controls: Fitment/Use Type and Controls (why it might be good for you): If you’ll be mainly using the m3s casually, commuting to work, wanting a comfortable fit, then the m3s might be good for you. Fitment wise, the m3s fit great. There are several ear tips to choose from, but the default one was sufficient for me. I would feel confident running in them, but I know the m3s aren’t really intended for that use, so I’d rather use a different TWE for running. Length of wear time is good; I feel that I can have them on for hours without having ear fatigue. In terms of controls, I found the touch control to be responsive and accurate. As of now, I haven’t had any accidental presses and I always knew what I was pressing since I’m able to customize the touch controls via Sennheiser Smart Control App. The one thing I wish the m3 had regarding touch controls is getting some voice confirmation on what I had activated/deactivated; for example, the Jabra Elite 7 Pros would give me a confirmation on what I had activated/deactivated every time I had touched the button. Aside from the m3s lacking the voice confirmation, the m3s touch control is sufficient for my use. Fitment/Use Type and Controls (why it might be bad for you): If you’ll be mainly using the m3s to run/jog/work out, then the m3s are not for you (why – because the m3s are rated IPX4 (water resistant) and although fitment is secure for daily use, fitment is not highly secure for exercising purposes). Since the m3s are rated IPX4, it’s not going to be exactly the best TWE to work out with, especially if you sweat heavily. Also, if absolute fitment is key to you, I suggest probably the most secure TWE with customizable fitment is the Ultimate Ears (UE) Fits; these literally can precisely mold into your ears. Other options to consider might be the Jaybird Vista 2, Beats Powerbeats Pro, Bose Sport Open, and the Anker Soundcore Life Dot 2; all these are better than the m3s in terms of fitment/use type. Regarding controls, everyone is going to have their preference (touch controls or physical controls?). For me, I prefer physical controls as I like the affirmation and tactile feeling of knowing that I had pressed a button. With touch controls, sometimes you can’t even tell if you had press something intentionally and/or unintentionally; therefore, I prefer physical controls. So, if physical controls are important for you, then the m3s might not be good for you. Consider the Jabra Elite line (e.g., 75t, 85t, 7 pro, etc) if physical controls are important. If you don’t mind the touch control, then the m3s might be good for you. The m3s have much of a better touch control than some of the TWEs out there; to name a few, m2s (not always consistent and wasn’t always accurate), Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros (one of the worst touch controls as they are very sensitive); Sony WF-1000XM4 (touch control was decent and better than the Liberty 3 Pros and m2s, but not better than the m3s). Although physical buttons is my preference, for me, it’s not one of those deal breaker features. Verdict for why the m3s might be good/bad for you in terms of connectivity: Connectivity (why it might be good for you): The m3s have Bluetooth 5.2, aptX Adaptive, aptX, AAC, and SBC. These are all great connectivity features, only if you have devices that support these; if not, then it won't matter; although having it is better than not having it. Since the m3s support 5.2, this means Bluetooth range is great and pairs much faster to devices than TWEs that are on 5.0 or 5.1 Bluetooth. For these reasons, the m3 might be good for you. Connectivity (why it might be bad for you): The m3s might not be a good for you if multi-point is an important feature for you, which if you don't know, multi-point allows the connection of two devices. So, this might be a deal breaker for some people; however, multi-point can be added in the future with a firmware/software update. Verdict for why the m3s might be good/bad for you in terms of noise cancelation: Noise cancelation and Transparency mode (why it might be good for you): If you’ll be using the m3s while commuting and while at the office, then the m3s might be good for you. The noise cancelling on the m3s are great (8 out of 10). Even without having adaptive noise cancelation on (passive isolation), the passive isolation is impressive and sometimes is sufficient where I just disable the adaptive noise cancelation to save battery. So, when you don't have active noise cancelling turned on, it still feels like it's on because passive isolation really blocks out background noise well. The m3s also don’t have that cabin pressure effect that the Sony WF-1000XMF have. Since I commute a lot, I can say that I can comfortable have the windows mid-way half down and still be able to listen to music without any interruptions from the wind noise; one of the great features of the m3s is being able to customize your settings through the Smart Control App; there's a feature in which is primary intended to block wind noise. Regarding transparency, if you want detailed and close to natural sound as if you aren’t wearing earbuds, then the m3s might be good for you. Noise cancelation and Transparency mode (why it might be bad for you): If you’ll be using the m3s in very noisy environments (e.g., stadium/arena full of people, busy malls, busy call centers, outside construction, and/or anything with that nature), then the m3s might not be good for you (why – because although the m3s have great passive noise isolation and great active noise cancelation, however, it is not superior in the noise cancelation category. If you want superior noise cancelation, maybe the Sony WF-1000XM4 and/or Bose QuietComfort might be good for you; the Sony’s or Bose will be more sufficient to block out most if not all background noise of a stadium/arena full of people. Regarding transparency mode, to put it simply, if you have transparency mode turned on with the m3s, the outside will sound very detailed; so if you don’t like that, then the m3s might not be good for you. Overall comparison between the m2s and m3s: -Loudness drastically improved from the m2s; even at max level volume, the m2s didn’t seem that loud; however, with the m3s, it gets very loud and have yet to reach max level volume (wouldn’t want to do that anyway). -Nose cancelling have drastically improved from the m2s. The nose cancelling from the m2s is a bit of a joke as it feels that it only reduces background noise by approx. 5-10%. However, with the m3s, background noise reduced approx 80%; this is a big jump from the m2s. -Mic/call quality significantly improved from the m2s. I really wanted to keep the m2s at the time because of the sound quality, but settled for the Soundcore Liberty Pro 3 because the mic quality on that thing is one of the best in the industry. So, now that I’ve been using the m3s and have noticed a significant improvement form the m2s, I’ll be selling my Soundcore Liberty Pro 3 and keep the m3s. -Touch controls have significantly improved from the m2s and are less sensitive, yet naturally responsive. The m2’s touch controls were a bit finicky and didn’t seem well-developed; however, the m3’s touch controls are accurate, responsive, and well-developed. -Sound quality considerably improved from the m2s. Although the m2s sound quality were already great to begin with, the m3s appears more articulate and detailed, thus sound quality is excellent as opposed to the m2s. -The design has considerably improved; the m3s appears sleeker and no longer have the shiny aluminum finish (my personal preference) from the m2s. The m3s are also smaller and weighs less than the m2s. -The m3s are cheaper than the m2s when they were first introduced (however, the m2s are now cheaper due to the availability of the m3s). One of the reasons why I returned the m2s were because the call quality and/or mic quality was mediocre; this is why I ended up getting the Soundcore Liberty Pro 3s because the mic quality in addition to the sound quality was excellent. My overall take: I've tried many true wireless earbuds, endlessly searching for the right ones. To name a few: Sennheiser Momentum 2 (currently $199), Jabra Elite 7 Pro (currently $199); Jabra Elite 85t (currently $229); Jabra Elite 75t (currently $215); Anker Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro (currently $129); Master & Dynamic MW08 (currently $299); Bose QuietComfort (currently $279); Sony WF-1000XM4; Apple AirPods Pro; Klipsche T5 II McLaren Edition; Bowers & Wilkins PI7 (currently $400); Grado GT220 (currently $259); Bang & Olufsen Beoplay EQ (currently $399). Based on my numerous attempts from trying my numerous TWEs, I hope you can tell that I like quality sound and although I won’t consider myself an audiophile, I can differentiate between quality sound and poor sound. Originally, I ended up with the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros. The sound quality is amazing, almost just as good as the m2 and m3s; however, where the Liberty Pros lacked was with its weak noise cancelling, awkwardly having to put and take out the earbuds from its case; fitment wasn't always great; touch controls were overly sensitive. After a few weeks and usage of the m3s, I can say that the m3s are one of the best TWEs that I've tried. I've been wanting to replace the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros for awhile now due to the annoyances that I've mentioned earlier, and the m3s have taken my spot in terms of best overall TWEs (for my use and preferences). I plan on trying the Technics EAH-AZ60-K ($229) to see if it can beat the m3s. I'll update my review once I receive it. If not, I plan on keeping the m3s for awhile. For now, I'm happy with the m3s. I plan of updating my review to 5 stars if the m3s is still able to beat the Technics. Likewise, if I have start having problems with the m3s, I’ll adjust my review accordingly. Updated Review: June 02, 2022: Here’s an update (and why I’ve decided to keep the M3s): As mentioned earlier from my initial review, I would only give the M3s 5 stars if it held up to the Technics AZ60s. So here’s the update: *Call quality is very important to me; that’s why I previously had the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros (L3P) as I believe it’s the best true wireless earbuds (TWE) for both audio quality and phone/mic quality. However, I ended up getting rid of the L3P due to several reasons (e.g., ANC was mediocre, connectivity issues, odd fitment, touch control sensitivity issues, and a finicky case). For these reasons, I decided to give up the L3P and try out the M3s. So, after trying out the M3s, I decided to try and compare it to the Technics AZ60. So here’s my take between the M3s and the AZ60: *Both have very good mic quality, but I thought the Technics AZ60 had better a better mic quality; however, it only shines in environments with minimal background noise. In contrast, the M3s seem to do a better job overall in call quality/mic use in both noisy environments as background noise is less noticeable than with the AZ60s. As soon as there is heavy background noise, the AZ60s voice clarity and quality start to deteriorate. *The max volume level on the M3s is one of the loudest (I have yet to have it on max volume as I wouldn’t want to) from the other TWEs I've tried in the past. In contrast, the AZ60s don't get to a level high enough where it would hurt my ears if volume maxed out (a similar issue with the L3P). Verdict: I've decided to bump up my review to 5 stars as I believe the M3s were able to hold off the AZ60s. Although, here's why I WOULD have kept the AZ60s: *The AZ60s case is almost less than half the size of the m3s. This is not too much of a big deal for me, but it just annoys me to see the M3s case bulge out in my pocket. Although the case quality is much better on the M3s, I don’t mind the case quality of the AZ60s as it is fairly a straight forward case, that’s small and light weight, which I prefer. *The sound quality on the AZ60s is slightly better the the M3s in terms of clarity and richness; although bass is a bit more prominent on the AZ60s than the M3s. *The AZ60’s provide voice feedback/confirmation whenever pressing/tapping the touch control (e.g., “noise cancelling on,” “transparency on,” etc.); whereas the M3s offer no kind of confirmation after tapping/pressing the earbuds. *Noise cancelling on the AZ60s are somewhat identical to the M3s; however, I believe the AZ60s is slightly better, with about a 2% edge over the M3s. Here's why I DECIDED to keep the M3s: *Phone/Mic quality is probably the most important factor for me when it comes to TWEs; secondly, it would be the sound quality. I could not fathom why there are a lot of reviews out there praising the call quality from the AZ60s. Yes, the call quality is great, but ONLY in quiet environments. Overall, it does a terrible job, as I mentioned earlier, on being able to suppress the background noise from my end to the other caller. I've done multiple tests to test the call/mic quality by leaving myself voicemails in different environments (e.g., driving with the window up/down; walking in a busy street; being near a large crowd, etc), and I found that it doesn't make any sense to have a high quality mic, when voice gets distorted from the background noise. I only found the call quality from the AZ60s to be great in quiet environments. However, the M3s did a great job on suppressing background noise from my end to the other caller. Due to the reason above and reasons mentioned prior to this update, I’ve decided to keep the M3s and return the AZ60s. Hope this helps.",

    "self_text": "> I finally did it. I out-pizza'd the Hut. It was the greatest mistake of my life.  > After years of perfecting my recipe, I made my way down to the local hut, fresh-baked pizza pie in hand. \"Try this,\" I told the kid working the counter. He did, and he had to agree that it was better than anything Pizza Hut had to offer. Soon, the entire store, customers included, was feasting on my delicious pie. The manager walked over, grabbed a slice, and took a bite. I look at him, anticipation rising. This was the boss, the local fief lord of the Hut. His approval meant more to me than all the rest combined. He took a bite and nodded. \"I'll be damned,\" he said, \"you really did it. You out-pizza'd the Hut. Shame.\" Shame? What did he mean by tha- the manager pulled a gun out from behind his apron and shot the nearest customer in the head. \"We have a Code Jalapeño,\" he said into his wrist as he executed the remaining customers. \"I repeat, we have a Code Jalapeño.\" The ground was slick with blood. The kid working the counter choked out his dying breath as the manager turned to me. \"You just had to do it motherfucker. You just had to out-pizza the Hut.\" He shoved the gun in my face. I was too scared to fight, too scared to run. The manager pulled the trigger.  > A click. The gun was empty. I threw a chair at the manager and scrambled out of the Pizza Hut, not even bothering to see if my missile hit its mark. I was closely pursued by the manager, who had gotten his hands on a deadly sharp pizza cutter. I suspected in his hands it would cut more than pizza. Somehow, I was able to get into my car and speed off, the manager cursing my existence as I left him behind. I took a deep breath. The manager was clearly psychotic. Yes, that was it, just a crazy man with a gun. It had to be. My phone rang. Sister. I picked it. \"They're dead, she sobbed. They're all dead. M-mom, dad, Chris, Bill. Dead. They killed them all.\" I could barely understand her, so great were her sobs. \"What do you mean? Where are you?\" I asked urgently. \"How is this possi-\" a single gunshot sounded through my phone's speakers. Silence. Then, I heard a man's voice. \"No one out-pizzas the Hut.\" He hung up. I drove down the empty county road, mind blank. I had nothing. They killed my family. I was alone.  > At that moment I knew what I had to do. They took everything from me. Well then, I would take everything from them. Pizza Hut was so terrified of being out-pizza'd, they forgot there's one thing worse than a man with a recipe: A man with nothing to lose. I'll give them a limited time offer they won't be able to refuse: two bullets for the price of one.  > With a free side order of pain.",

One of my favourite subreddits is r/AskReddit, where the redditors of reddit can express their opinions and ask questions to the reddit community. It is truly a great subreddit.

    "title": "The poop policy",
    "self_text": "Nice try Mark  In the early days of facebook Mark Zuckerburg would wander into the company bathrooms and if he noticed someone sitting down in the stalls he would pop his head over and try to talk to them about their projects. Or if he was taking a poop he would host an emergency meeting and he would tell them to come over and pop their head over the stall to talk it out.  Everyone just went along with it because it was either YOLO SILICON VALLEY LMAO or they were just too intimidated.  That all stopped when Michael Moritz, legendary silicon valley investor, and one of Facebook biggest early investors and shareholders, was at the campus doing research for leading a 2nd round of funding. He was doing diligence all day and at one point had to poop and that's when Zuckerburg popped his head over with a smile to ask how's the diligence coming along.  Michael Moritz, not one to mince words, was apoplectic. 'GET THE FUCK OUT HERE YOU IDiOT LIZARD LOOKING FUCKER.' Mark Zuckerburg nervously tried to laugh it off and persisted, because he really loved intimate poop conversations 'Aw c'mon Michael, it's silicon valley'. Zuckerburg finally withdrew when Moritz flung a poop at him.  30 minutes later, Mark was in a very import meeting when Moritz walked into the conference room. 'Everyone except Mark Zuckerburg, OUT'. As intimidated as they were of Zuckerburg, at the time Moritz was the bigger deal, and they all scurried out of the room.  Zuckerburg, however, is not one to be intimated by anyone. Not the Winkewoz twins, not Eduardo Savarn, not Peter Thiel, and not one of his biggest shareholder Michael Moritz. Zuckerburg passionately defended his practice, but Michael Moritz was having none of that. Moritz told him that it was a ticking PR and HR catastrophe, and threatened to pull out of leading the 2nd round of funding if Mark continued, which would have been a calamity for the company.  Zuckerburg pretended to arbitrate 'Ok fine, but you need to give me a good reason'.  Moritz was flabberghasted at this response. Was this a serious question? He answered with the most obvious answer 'Because it's not FUCKING NORMAL'.  Unknown to Moritz, Zuckerburg had guessed a conversation like this would happen as soon as he was kicked out of the toilet stall, and began formulating a strategy to counter Moritz demands. Zuckerburg knew that Moritz would have all the leverage, but Zuckerburg was a master strategist.  Zuckerburg went for the pounce. 'Okay, I'll lets write out an agreement, in writing I'll rescind the policy because it's not normal'. Moritz was dumbfounded, but he was used to being dumbfounded by eccentric tech founders, afterall he was also an early investor in Apple, and he still found Zuckerburg tame compared to Steve Jobs. Moritz had a long day of work so they signed the agreement so that he could go back to doing his due diligence.  When Moritz left, a broad grin spread across Zuckerburg's face. \" 'Not Normal' eh? \" Zuckerburg said with a menacing laugh. Ever since then, Mark Zuckerburg has been on a life-long crusade to normalize poop conversations.  He had a checklist of what he needed to accomplish in order to realize this. His advisors would tell him it's impossible, but one by one Zuckerburg checked off the list. From trusting Mark with their private photos, to normalizing people giving up their internet browsing privacy.  In 2015, Zuckerburg knew he would hit a wall, having people watch you while you poop was still too much of a leap. That's when Zuckerburg decided to buy Occulus, and eventually shift his company towards virtual reality. If he could coax people into having life-like conversations while they were pooping in a virtual reality, then doing it in the real world wouldn't be too big of a leap.  Zuckerburg only has 3 more boxes to check off before poop conversations are normalized.  Mark Zuckerburg wants to watch you poop.  Are you going to let him?",

    "self_text": "It appears the world has entered a paradigm shift. After hundreds of years of complaining about the Christmas season starting before Thanksgiving, I believe the world has finally come to terms with Santa Claus and his plans for World domination, by slowly taking over one calendar month at a time.   Never thought I'd see the day that all of the folks in my neighborhood would have inflatable snowmen and chicken wire reindeer and sleighs in their backyard the day after Halloween, but here we are. I guess there's not a lot to give thanks for this Holiday season, not with old Saint Nick spreading Christmas cheer like an evergreen plague.  So have a Holly jolly Christgiving everyone, it's only a matter of time now before next year's Christloween pops up and we're all dressing up as reindeer and elves, knocking on the doors of our neighbors who have decided that Halloween lights can double as Christmas lights if they get them in just the right color. Carrying our stockings around, door to door, while everybody hands out those tacky Dollar store last minute Christmas gifts as supplement for candy corn and black licorice.  God help us all.  And after Halloween's gone what's next? Memorial Day?  INDEPENDENCE DAY?! I'll be damned if I let that fat Cherry nosed Son of a bitch change the red white and blue flag to silver and Gold! Christians, you think God is behind this? Look around you, we're all slaves, pulling around Santa's sleigh, carrying a bottomless bag filled to the brim with an undying thirst for hot cocoa, milk, and the blood of the innocent.   That's right. Christ wasn't born on Christmas. I'll tell you what was though, a one way ticket to planet where Jack Frost isn't just nipping at your toes, but he's nipping at your wife's neck, too. Global warming can't save us now.  SATAN. SANTA. You think that was intentional? You bet your cherry red jingle bells that it was. So wake up and smell the mistletoe before it's too late, because before long, he's coming for your parents, Mother's day? Father's Day? Those weird family Holidays that millennials made up in order to make themselves feel more important? Yeah, that's right, he's coming for your Aunts and uncles, your cousins, your kids, and your grandkids, and it all starts here. November first.",

    "self_text": "Trump ruined my life and I'm happy to see him crash and burn. Back in 2016, I was his biggest supporter. I went to a couple rallies and I donated a decent some of money to his campaign. On election night, I was watching the coverage with my gf at the time, who was a hardcore hildog supporter (out of politics, she was a pretty cool chick so we didn't have any issues). When it became apparent hilary was going to lose, she started to lose her shit and was getting real mouthy. I tried to calm her down to no avail. She eventually said \"Trump supporters are going to pay for what they've done today!\" so I responded with \"start with me, you stupid bitch!\" The dumb whore slapped me across my face. Once this cunt realized what she did, her face turned paler than a ghost. I chuckled and let off a slight grin, then I cold-cocked her right in the face. She dropped to the floor instantly and I grabbed her by the hair and started to smash her face into the phucking floor. The neighbors heard her screaming and called the cops. I wound up getting five-years in prison. I got out in 2021 just to find our Trump didn't build the wall, he didn't drain the swamp, Hilary wasn't in prison, cucked on aid to Israel, and was another chickenhawk with his intervention in Syria and Iran. I went to prison defending this snake, so it's pretty epic ftw seeing the republicucks crashing and burning right now, not to mention Trump's going to be indicted in two more weeks. I obviously can't vote, but I live in a state with loose voter ID laws. My geriatric father has the same name as me, so I used his name at the polling station and voted blue down the line. Feels good man.",

    "self_text": "December 14th, the 17th 1965, I attempted to escape this worse, mongrel gangster communist country to return to the Slovenic Polish land of my forefathers. Instead in a gangster stage, parroting puppet deadly conspiracy, I was flown from Kennedy, New York airport at night to a small distance St. Lawrence River estuary snowbound small airport under the guise that I was in Warsaw Poland. Immediately many, many things proved this to me, including the two big white asbestos, shingle hangars with the large Braniff airway signs on their sidewalls. In addition to the many blurted statements I solicited from the many CIA deadly gangsters, the assassin of me, the many many parroting puppets all around me, I demanded an immediate flight back to Kennedy, New York airport. Instead I was held captive all night later in chains. I refused both all food and requests to go to sleep. Then CIA police gangsters pretending to be Polish police with no identification beat me bloodly later while my return trip 707 Boeing jet airliner was being serviced for my return trip. I quickly walked into the airplane and saw a CIA gangster with a small electric hairdryer type blower pumping deadly poison nerve gas smoke into secret compartments under the ash trays in the arms of the chairs where later I was ordered to sit in the airplane full of CIA underlings, passengers, my assassins who giggle as they watched me dragged and changed by the airplane by the gangster CIA police gangsters. These deadly gangster CIA passengers they press the frontal panel of the ash trays in the seat arms to release the deadly poison nerve gas smoke.",

    "title": "A letter to Morten616.",
    "self_text": "Well played, sir. When the tiebreaker sealed my fate, your left tower was on 346 hp and your right, at 212. We both know that if I had placed my cannon but one tile to the right, your incredible Electro giant elite barbarians push would not have had the capability to do nearly as much damage as it did. Alas, as fingers have a tendency to do, mine slipped, allowing your indubitably well thought-out attack to take all but 108 hp of my tower. And that rage you played after everything had already died? I’m sure there was a good motive for that too.   Anyway, I won’t question you any further on the semantics of the match itself. You won fair and square, albeit through the assistance of my errors, and that’s the end of that. But you know deep down, Morten616, deep down you know, just as well as I do, that of the two of us, I played the better game. Not in general, perhaps, but within the confines of that match, I always had the edge. That’s not to say you didn’t respond well- you did, after all, defend both towers through to completion- but if it weren’t for that one lucky break, that momentary lapse of judgement, I think we both know that I’d find myself 30 trophies higher than I do today.  You even recognised my skill- when I predicted your princess placed at the bridge you went as far as to give me a prince-sipping-cup-of-tea emote, and I see little else it could have been in reference to. You did not react, but you saw too my precisely timed king tower activation using the log and skeletons to redirect your elite barbarian. And we all saw that your one spectator even cheered for me after I countered your split lane 23 elixir push.   In a game of strategy and skill, a battle of wit and reflexes, we were all but evenly matched until the end. It was a noble fight, one that showcased strategy and stamina from both sides, and I lost out by very little. Two more seconds- that’s what I’d have needed, two more ticks from the clock, to unleash that final fireball and turn the tide in my favour. Alas, I could not. It happens- no warrior can conquer every battle, no general win every war.   I went as far as to offer you a “Good game!”, Morten616, in recognition of our epic fight. I followed it up with a “Good luck!”, to wish you all the best for your future conquests. And that would have been it, sir, the end of our saga- it would have been, had you not then repeatedly insulted me with your yawning-princess emote.  I was taken aback at first. Surely this was not the same gentlemen with whom I had exchanged a well meaning king-giving-thumbs-up emote only six minutes before? What had changed, Morten616? What had changed so drastically in those six minutes, that you could no longer look me in the eye, and treat me like a man? A fellow companion on a journey through the fearsome terrain of mid ladder? What unwelcome force had turned you against me? I pondered all this as you continued to throw out yawn after yawn for a good thirty seconds after the match had ceased.  I put down my phone, Morten616. I put down my phone because of you. I allowed my blood to boil for a good thirty seconds as I thought of the unspeakable acts I would commit if we ever met in real life. But as all things do, it passed. By tomorrow I’ll have forgotten your name, and the day beyond that, I’ll be fighting new battles, facing new noble adversaries, most of whom will hopefully treat me better than you did.   I hope you’re happy, Morten616. I know not of what terrible occurrences must be happening in your life for you to have treated me in such a manner. Stay safe. Things will get better for you I’m sure- who knows, one day you may even meet a beautiful woman, or better yet, make a friend. But when that day comes, my dear Morten, I hope you treat them with respect and dignity, and leave your yawning-princess and goblin-sticking-his-tongue-out emotes at home. No one likes a sore winner. And remember this above all else: karma is the great equaliser. Being kind is free. In the grand scale of this universe we live in, good sir, you would have benefitted no less from simply leaving that very match without any further comment. I take little satisfaction in knowing that you will suffer for the suffering you caused to others, but such is the way of the universe.  Anyway, my dear Morten, that’s all I have to say. All the best, chief. I recovered those thirty trophies the next game you’ll be pleased to hear. I see you’ve since dropped 200. I look, now, at your shortcomings, existence’s response to your mistreatment of a fellow traveller along this mortal plane, and I can’t help but smile a little. It’s a cruel world out there, but it’s run by love. Maybe one day you’ll learn that. -Trainer Bob:)  [names have been changed to protect the identities of those involved]  source: https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashRoyale/comments/z5uvon/a_letter_to_morten616/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button",

    "title": "How to write a \"pick me!\" validation post",
    "self_text": "Looking to hone your creative writing skills? Well, look no further.  Today is the first in a series of creative workshops to help you get the most eyes on your shitpost with the least effort. We'll be covering the fan-favorite \"pick me!\" validation post.  Before we get started, let's identify your target audience. The \"pick me!\" validation post caters to:   nice guys who want to project their ex onto the villain  teenage girls with an inferiority complex about their sister  garden variety misogynists  people with zero critical thinking skills   Consider your audience as you write the post. Don't reveal your hero to be less than perfect or go easy on your villain. One misstep and you might offend them and end up with YTAs - or worse,  ESHs .  Okay, let's get started.  Title your post. This should be sloppy, vague, and have an infuriating error like \"AITA made my sister cry\".  To introduce your post, you want to describe your hero with as much unnecessary detail about her appearance as possible. She can't be older than 27 (but that's really pushing it - 23 is safe). Make your hero seem demure by chucking in a line about how:   she's so shy and introverted unlike anyone else  men are always giving her attention but she doesn't understand why  it's always been a struggle growing up with the stigma of being slender   Now you want to give your hero the facade of being progressive. No problem - just say that she's got tattoos and/or piercings and a quirky hobby. Try to make that hobby the flavor of the week so embroidery or collecting scarves. It really doesn't matter.  Otherwise, the hero needs to be meek, mild, and preferably in a long-term relationship with their long-term partner.  Then just launch into a description of the villain. She'll probably be the hero's older sister, cousin, friend, or step-sister. The villain is ripe with possibilities. But you really need to hit on these ideas to highlight that the villain is a bad woman:   she's old (around 35) but hasn't retreated into the background  she's promiscuous  she's either barren or has too many children  she's bad at picking a potential mate    TIP : Give the villain an ugly moniker like 'Gert' or 'Bertha' to really hammer home that she's a disgusting witch.  Include a little backstory about how the villain mistreated the hero growing up. Maybe she taunted the hero for being so ravishing. Or perhaps the villain terrorized everyone with her extraversion. This can be as lazy and untrue to life as you like.  By now, you're over halfway through the post and you need to squeeze in the dilemma. The details may change but the main conflict is that  the villain doesn't know her place and it's the hero's job to show her.  Here are some common themes that other writers have used:   the villain wants some of the hero's fabulous wealth  one of the villain's disobedient children destroys the hero's property and she expects a pass  the parents ask the hero to get the villain out of a jam  either the villain or one of her broad insults the hero  the villain complains that the hero has something she wants   This brings us to the climax where your hero uncharacteristically finds their backbone and either gives a \"cutting\" speech or a \"witty\" retort. Whatever she says, it's so devastating that the villain loses all control and bursts into tears, runs away, and/or \"blows up\".  Of course, the villain is wicked to the core so they don't learn anything. They continue to believe they're entitled to the same kind of rewards as the hero even though they didn't earn them by toeing the line. But it's a satisfying ending because we know that life will continue to punish the villain.  For a finishing touch, forget about your hero's newfound confidence and add a line about how she's so so worried she might be the asshole. You can even throw in a line about how you love your sister deep down even though your whole post has been dripping with disdain.  There's a chance you missed a detail and got some YTAs. Don't worry - it happens to the best of us. Just throw in a comment or two with buzzwords like \"golden child\" or \"parentification\". It doesn't matter if it contradicts the story because your readers will bend reality to fit your story.  That's all for today. See you next week for more terrible writing tips.   Disclaimer: Please don't actually go and brigade AITA. There's enough nonsense on there and it's against the rules of this sub.",

I walked down the steps in a haze after waking up. I was feeling so ill. I made loud groans until all the adults turned to face me - including my mom. That’s when I did it. I proceeded to projectile vomit sea monkey water all over the foyer. It soaked a bunch of women’s purses that were resting on the bench below. Also I managed to get quite a bit on this guy’s camera.

Furthermore, when Putin speaks of the “unity” between Ukraine and Russia, he’s not speaking of any wish to dissolve the political borders and combine the two nations. Absolutely not. He compares the type of relationship Russia seeks with Ukraine to that between Canada and the US, and between Austria and Germany.

Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.  We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.  We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.  Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.  Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?  These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse things by prepubescent 10 year olds with a shitty head set. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.  Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight.",

    "self_text": "This is a contextual question. You must be aligned to several Intersecting systems of common consensus to answer it, and then you're only answering within the constraints of that system.  To the fly, the spiderweb is chaos. To the spider, it's dinner, and home.  That being said, I'm so far left I fell off the bloody bird!  My core tenets in life are a mantra: be happy, have fun, harm none.  There is a universal premise that bothers me: life feeds on life. This is in constant opposition to \"harm none\" which means, at best, I'm neutral... While I'm entirely opposed to the concept, there's another imperative which must be followed: survival. If I had the resources, I would have already made lab meat a reality, and would be working toward synthetic amino acids in what essentially is replicator technology. Since I endure, and yearn for a better existence I am lawful; though most anyone not in the process of dying immediately is as well.  You cannot always be happy, and have fun. I've pondered on this disappointing aspect of reality, and have come to the general consensus that emotions are not a choice. There is an infinite number of worlds running parallel to \"reality\" and they give us a series of emotional responses according to our development/paradigm. Emotions are not a choice, but our reaction to them is. This fact is why I accept emotions, and actively seek avenues of happiness, which is fun imo.   An example of this is that depression is observably chemical. That means there is a system in your physiology that is producing these chemicals. Through careful self reflection you can see what is causing your internal malfunction. This process is not independently done, it requires outside assistance. I take meds for depression because there are several inescapable avenues to depression. You don't just get over some things, ever, and that's okay. I will never be okay with following the blood trail to the mangled body of the dog I was taking care of, and I would not be okay with myself otherwise.   I think that Native Americans should run the world. This is because of a historic track record of being stewards to the planet, and not killing everyone they found mildly inconvenient. They are entirely the most mature specimen of humanity that I know of. I'm confident that they are the next step in human development, and unwilling to regress to European standards.  See why I fell off the bird?   I'd like to see myself as lawful good, but the current system of law is identifiably evil in several aspects. I am opposed to those aspects which is considered chaotic. Though chaos is a concept I'm entirely opposed to outside the realm of awful things ceasing to run smoothly. Raw chaos is evil to me, it is when you drop something, and go to pick it up, and two more things fall in an exponential loop. There's nothing fun about chaos, and it absolutely doesn't need any supporters to maintain it's odious affliction on reality. You could call this neutral, I guess, but I am not in favor of following the pull away from my core tenets.  As long as I'm allowed to impose my own law (which insist sustainability), I am lawful, and my desires are identifiably good outside the context of careless, genocidal oligarchs, and their cronies edging the species, and planet toward fulfilling a creation myth which ends in extinction.  I suppose to many this counts as chaotic good.  It's all about context really.",

    "title": "Minecraft Wiki",
    "self_text": "Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game originally created by Markus \"Notch\" Persson. It is maintained by Mojang Studios, a part of Xbox Game Studios, which in turn is part of Microsoft.  From its creation, Minecraft was developed almost exclusively by Notch until Jens \"Jeb\" Bergensten started working with him and has since become head of its development. It features music by Daniel \"C418\" Rosenfeld, Kumi Tamioka and Lena Raine and paintings by Kristoffer Zetterstrand. Initially released as what is now known as Minecraft Classic on May 17, 2009, the game was fully released on November 18, 2011. Since its release, Minecraft has expanded to mobile devices and consoles.  Minecraft focuses on allowing the player to explore, interact with and modify a dynamically-generated map made of one-cubic-meter-sized blocks. In addition to blocks, the environment features plants, mobs and items. Some activities in the game include building, mining for ore, fighting hostile mobs and crafting new blocks and tools by gathering various resources found in the game. The game's open-ended model allows players to create structures, creations and artwork on various competitive or collaborative multiplayer servers or their single-player maps. Other features include redstone circuits for logic computations and remote actions, minecarts and tracks, and a mysterious underworld called the Nether. A designated but completely optional goal of the game is to travel to a dimension called the End and defeat the Ender dragon.  The player is the person that the user controls in the world. When the user starts a game, the player is put in a world, generated by a random or specified seed, with an empty inventory. If the bonus chest option is enabled, a chest filled with basic items generates near the player. The player has a health bar with 10 hearts and can be damaged by falls, suffocation, drowning, fire, lava, lightning, cacti, sweet berry bushes, magma blocks, falling into the Void, hitting another entity with thorns armor, splash potions, falling anvils, freezing in powder snow and being hit by mobs and other players. Damage to health can be mitigated by armor or the Resistance effect, and health can be restored by keeping the hunger bar full enough and drinking specific potions. If the difficulty is set to Peaceful, health regenerates on its own. Hunger is also a factor if the difficulty is not set to Peaceful, depleting over time and even faster while sprinting, jumping or swimming. Food replenishes the hunger level; however, eating rotten flesh and raw chicken has a chance of giving the player a hunger effect. Depending on the difficulty level, starvation depletes a player's health and may even kill the player. A player can change their skin on the profile page of Minecraft.net or in the Minecraft Launcher in Java Edition and in the pause or main menus on Bedrock Edition.  The world of Minecraft takes place within a three-dimensional grid of cubes, with each cube being occupied by a certain type of block, not all of which are necessarily cubic. There are different types of blocks; natural blocks such as grass, stone and ores that generate randomly within the world. There are also blocks that players can craft, such as a crafting table and a furnace. Resources can be extracted from blocks by hand or by using tools. Some of these resources are simply blocks in the player's inventory that can be placed elsewhere, while others are used as material to create other blocks or tools. Others yield no practical use whatsoever. Some blocks cannot be broken through normal survival means, e.g. bedrock, end portal frames, command blocks, nether and end portals, barriers and air.  Mining is one of the main aspects of Minecraft and is done to extract ore and other materials mainly from below the surface of the map. These ores include coal, iron, gold, redstone, diamond, lapis lazuli, copper and emerald. Mining can involve digging a hole from the surface or going down through a cave. Mineshafts and ravines create extra areas that may contain resources, since they are usually rich in ores.  Crafting allows players to create new tools and blocks using items from their inventory. Subsequent versions often contain crafting recipes for new blocks and items. A player can use the 2×2 grid in the inventory or the 3×3 grid provided by a crafting table to craft. Smelting requires a furnace in addition to fuel and processes blocks into a more useful form such as from raw iron into iron ingots, which can then be crafted into iron tools and iron armor.",

I was the shadowy standing ass wiper.   All these years, had I been doing it wrong? I mean, that’s just how my parents used to wipe my ass when I was little so I just assumed that’s how it was to be done.   I rushed home from work and began Googling how to effectively wipe your ass. No shit.   I stumbled on a Youtube video of a kindergarten teacher who taped two balloons to the back of a chair. She then took some toilet paper, leaned to the side and demonstrated reaching behind and wiping between the two balloons.   I was AMAZED. Like holy shit, that seems so much simpler than standing up, jamming your butt cheeks back together and trying to force a wad of toilet paper in there.   PLUS I’ll never have to be known as the shadowy standing ass wiper again.   I’ve been a sitting/leaning wiper ever since.   🙏",

Few minutes later these people 2 people came and put me in a body bag and took me outside to the van. At the point my family started crying really hard, my boyfriend showed no empathy.   My funeral was on the 7th and they had viewing of the body with me in the casket. Again, my family was crying but he wasn't. He did not shed one tear.

    "self_text": "Although fiction may use real people and real events along with or instead of imaginary characters, my view is that it crosses the line and becomes an egregious act of slanderous defamation and calumnious denigration when it deliberately distorts the reality of a historically prominent figure and maliciously misrepresents the nature and character of that person. So, for example, to portray a known-to-be-non-violent person such as Jesus of Nazareth as being some kung-fu warrior who inflicts bodily harm upon others does way more than cross that line that ignores the reality of Jesus...it tries to form that line into another bloody cross and nail Him to it all over again! Although non-violent, Jesus is certainly no cowardly wimp. And not all students of His teachings are gonna just sit back and turn the other cheek so to speak while movie-makers merrily mock Him like He is some kind of circus clown or prophet puppet fashioned solely for their amusement! Woe unto thee, ye ungodly perpetrators of this cosmic crime, an evil attack against God and All Beings Holy and Divine! Woe unto thee, you mischievously wicked malcontents who peddle your dirty little damnation deed perhaps inspired by some demonically-flavored Satan-seed! Woe unto thee, ye blinded by darkness fools who squirm like slothful worms in the thick mud of night, trembling like broken twigs in the wind when confronted by the God of Life and Light! So to sum up this movie in just three words: Slander. Blasphemy. Sacrilege. To sum up Jesus in three words: I will not even attempt that one. There are no words adequate enough to even partially describe His gracious nature and charismatic personality. But to know Him is to love Him. And to love Him is to defend Him when others spit in His Face and trample all over His offers of mercy and grace.",

    "self_text": "Yes! I recently face fucked a girl and had one of those \"perfect timing\" moments with throat and suction and I came so hard I screamed and knees damn near gave out. She asked if i was OK. 🤣🤣😏😏 Does that cause any problems to a girl trying to swallow? Ahah I dribble most of the time now, but when I was younger I would shoot like crazy. Every once in a while, for reasons I don’t understand, I’ll fire off like crazy. Just turn the dial on his balls to desired range Hydration also plays a part I'm older, so it'll some times come out in a dry, powder form. Unfortunately for my other half I'm a hair, eye and nose shooter... It varies depending on how horny I am, how long I've edged, and how long it's been since I last came. Sometimes I get a knuckle runner, sometimes it'll shoot out like a firework... I call it throwing rope aka shoots If you are concerned with the \"showmanship part\" I have nothing to say as I rarely shoot more than an inch outward and the rest dribbles. If you are concerned with your capability of impregnating a woman as a non shooter, i can tell you that if your sperm is healthy and fertile you will get it done whether you shoot or dribble provided you stay in.  I was concerned about it and we never had issues getting pregnant. I just ejaculate with my whole penis inside, that does the job.  Btw, I don't judge anyone who would want to shoot big loads. I get it is what porn shows as the more masculine way of doing that... Just know that some scenes might not   did ya know the cum comes out at like 20 mph I'm only familiar with the blast it out method. Drip out? If that happened to me I'd call my doctor. I do it 4 times a day ..so 1st time .it drips .and last .nothing comes out When I was younger I could hardly ever shoot. When I got to about 24 I started being able to shoot somehow and now at 26 I almost always shoot most of my load up to my chest or even sometimes can get in my hair or on my face. It’s unpredictable. dripping out to me looks like precum or semen because it’s getting sensitive and when it shoots out it feels Amazing",

Give me a fucking break. Killing your own Pokemon! Has the Pokemon anime taught you NOTHING? That destruction for the purpose of making yourself more powerful only leads to ruin? So next time you catch an Exeggcute, an innocent, beautiful, family of eggs, you better give that fucking Pokemon an Everstone.

This rule does not apply to less important countries like the US or UK and any memes about their elections will continue to get the ban hammer  And finally, to all Bahraini voters in this sub, remember to vote. The world's future depends on it.  PS: Apparently United Statesians will be going to the polls tommorow as well. I'm not really familiar with the politics of developing nations, but from what I can gather this election seems to pit the \"Republican Party\" (which from its name I assume is some sort of anti monarchist political party) lead by Donald Trump, who has been popularly called the \"United Statesian Bolsanaro\" against \"The Democrats\", who I believe have a similar ideology to the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party  If you are by any chance American, I encourage you to vote as well.

    "self_text": "AC dehumidifies. Heating technically doesn't dehumidify at all. Air's ability to hold moisture drops as temperature drops. It reaches a saturation point with less total moisture contain in the air. That means that hot air can hold more and often does. So when you use air conditioning to cool the surrounding air, that air's ability to hold moisture drops and any amount of moisture above that condenses and is not longer mixed with the air. That is how dew is formed. Hot air during the day cools off and the water that was in the air cannot be, so it falls to the ground.   However, when you take that hot wet air, cool it so it's colder drier air, then warm it up again without adding additional moisture, the capacity of that newly hot air to hold moisture goes up and lowers total relative humidity. This means the air is even drier feeling than it was before.   Lower ambient humidity outside of Frogon's enclosure means there is a moisture gradient and the extra moist air will want to spread out to establish equilibrium.",

See, normally if you go one on one with another wrestler, you got a 50/50 chance of winning! But I'm a genetic freak and I'm not normal! So you got a 25%, AT BEST, at beat me. Then you add Kurt Angle to the mix, your chances of winning drastic go down! See, the 3 way at Sacrifice, you got a 33 1/3 chance of winning, but I, I got a 66 and 2/3 chance of winning, because Kurt Angle KNOWS he can't beat me and he's not even gonna try! So Samoa Joe, you take your 33 1/3 chance, minus my 25% chance and you got an 8 1/3 chance of winning at Sacrifice! But then you take my 75% chance of winning, (if we was to go one on one), and then add 66 2/3 per cents, I got 141 2/3 chance of winning at Sacrifice! See Joe, the numbers don't lie, and they spell disaster for you at Sacrifice!",

    "self_text": "I’ve only got a few of them left which is fine, but it never ceases to amaze me how much stamina I have when I take a strong pain pill. I usually take them late in the evening and end up jerking off for far longer than I’d like, but I just get lost in it. I get horny every single time I’m on pills.  A couple weekends ago, I was staying with the guy I’m seeing and his roommate had some pain pills for us all to enjoy. When we eventually went to bed late that night, I fucked him for the very first time and actually never finished as we both passed out while spooning with me inside him.  I felt a little bad because i wasn’t thinking straight in my haze and I didn’t go easy on him at all. I’m pretty thick and sit right around 7 inches so I can’t exactly dive in immediately with most people. I really pounded him. I think we started in missionary, but it wasn’t long before I had him bent over the side of his bed. I was giving really deep strokes too, making sure he got every inch.  Surprisingly he didn’t make much sound during all of this, even with not having bottomed in a long time. I think the pill made it easier for him to bottom.  He told me he was walking funny for a couple days following that. 😏",

Now, a person who could easily gain access to their mod account and mod-mail could very easily fuck.their.shit.up. Removing all mods, publishing every message in mod mail, deleting the sub twitter and more could all be done with a few clicks.  Instead I've decided to do nothing but leave this note and urge them to clean up their act and not treat people like shit in their moderation and in mod mail. The way they talk about people in mod mail would seriously turn most members off ever using the sub again.

Redditors seem to not understand that I am not a \"nerd.\" A \"nerd\" is one of average IQ that studies science to show off, and appear smart. However, this description does not apply to me. I am not a \"nerd,\" but rather an intellectual. I do not have average IQ; my IQ is  at least  140. Not to compare myself, would you consider Albert Einstein a \"nerd?\" Of course not. He was born an intellectual and could therefore not control the urge of curiosity; a \"nerd\" would be able to control an urge of this nature. Since I do not have average IQ, I do not fulfill any aspect of what defines a \"nerd,\" and can therefore not be defined as one. Using the \"nerd\" emoji is harmful since it downgrades the value of intellectuals. According to a survey, the most influential career for American preteens is a social media influencer. The effect of the use of this emoji is apparent.",

What sets the horse anus apart is the bafflingly complex autonomic contractive motion of 4 muscular rings which function like sphinctoral guillotine. As the feces is squeezed out, the rings expand and the outermost ring is retracted into an interior skinfold resembling the human foreskin, leaving an interstital tissue fold to open air.  The two inner rings then contract, and push apart, severing the horse feces cleanly, allowing to drop free as the outer ring folds back through the interstital flap, creating a intrinsic wiping motion with the fourth ring as it contracts back into the horses rectum.  This advanced biological mechanism is so effective that many industrial companies have copied Nature's design for self- cleaning viscus liquid dispensers housed within complex machinery.",

I feel like cross ethnic dating is like eating other ethnicities cuisines so I don't think it's very difficult for us Gaysians to do, since we are a minority group. I think it is easier to do since there are not that many of us as well so we sort of have to try each other out.  I feel like I have access to other Gaysians around the world, besides America as well, but that could be more of a stretch because of language and cultural barriers but that is smaller as the world gets more and more global and barriers closing.  Do you guys find it hard? I like Japanese Koreans indians viet Thai whatever they maybe, I've tried all of your foods and cuisines and would like to date you.  The only thing could be geopolitical issues which are still around today which may or may not affect the relationship. Idk if Gaysians are as uptight about this.  Any thoughts??",

And yes I did give my main character a gender at the end. Her name will be Allen Miley. And I'll turn this idea into a trilogy of movies and maybe do some cross-overs with other Alien movies and them fighting to the death, and we let them win, but we include a plot-twist just before the credits. Ah yes, I see can see myself now loathing in fame, and then maybe 25 years later start another alien trilogy movies that will have a bunch of plot holes in them, but it won't matter cause people come for the nostalgia.",

And it would be cool if the numbing agent could be collected, dried and then snorted like cocaine. Cocaine you make with your body. So it’s good for ya!  And the single sperm should be resilient. Perhaps you could put it in an aquarium if you’re lonely. Watch it swim. And make it glow under a black light. That would be the easy part, (it already glows). Throughout the years you could ejaculate a bunch of them in a fish tank under a UV light and it would be like watching a wriggly underwater rave.  Edit: spelling, grandma",

I’m plentiful, stronger, intellectually superior, an academic weapon, fighting imbeciles like you for centuries upon centuries. You, a mere mortal, a  muggle , have no chance of winning against me. You are feeble. Unattractive. Useless. Financially inept. So before you attempt to destroy me again, think about your helplessness, and try to communicate in a more rational and positive manner. Telling me to seek psychological support when your father is a cocaine addict and your mother is absent? Find shame. Although we share great disparity, I wish you a grand, wonderful life, for I am mature, and shall never hold grudges. Have a spectacular and speedy recovery, Sir.",

They call me weird. \"Oh come on get tiktok, youtube is old, tiktok is literally just youtube but better, you're weird\" No fuck, im not weird, we'll see whos weird in 20 years when china has created a fucking world war z sceniaro, and me and a few americans are left.

I, (24M) was just fired from my job last Wednesday for shitting in the urinal in the office, before you call me weird, I (24M) was feeling really frustrated and needed to let off some steam, it’s just my way of dealing with things. Anyway, after my (24M) boss (65F) fired me, I left the building after repeatedly boxing her in the face.  After (24M) left the building, I noticed a homeless man near a wall begging for change, he noticed me (24M) and asked me for some money for a sandwich. I (24M) had already had it for the day, so I (24M) pulled him up by the hair and punched him 3 times in the nose and gave him a mean right hook to the jaw before slamming the back of his head into the wall a couple of times.   After I got home, I was beating my wife (12F) when the police knocked on the door, they said they were arresting me for “public indecency and assault and battery.” . Whatever that means.

I wander around my house and find my dog on my parents' bed. I run to him and reach to pet him for comfort.  My hands sink in... for he is cake.  I scream again and run for the door. This time I just charge through it, for it is cake.  As I continue on, the porch stairs (that are now cake) give way under the pressure of my foot. I fall to the ground, except it is not ground. It is cake.  I get up, and turn towards the street hoping to find something... someone that isn't cake.  As I make it to the street, I trip. And as suspected, the street is cake.  I try to get up. and fail.  I look behind me, and there is my foot.  I gasp and a feeling of dread washes over me.  Then a new feeling, or more accurately, a lack of it.  I raise my arm, and it falls off, just below the elbow. I stare at it.  Cake.  \"I am... cake?\" I say as the rest of my body begins to crumble. I try to cry but cannot, for I am cake.  I give in to the cake, and fall over.  \"I am cake.\" I say.  \"All. Is. cake.\"  Everything around me fades, as I feel myself fusing with the street cake.  I cease to feel. My senses dissipate but it does not matter to me.  I am cake.  Cake is all that matters.  There is only...  CAKE",

    "self_text": "To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Gintama. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Gintoki's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Haruki Murakami literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Gintama truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Gintoki's existencial catchphrase \"It's Gintaming time!\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Akinari's Japanese epic  Ugetsu Monogatari . I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Hideaki Sorichi's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. You know, I just realized that I could probably write whatever I want here and no one would know any better. People only read the first few sentences and maybe the last few, so I doubt anyone's reading this right now. I guess I'll take this opportunity to get something off my chest that I've always wanted to: Howl's Moving Castle is a bit overrated. Not to say I didn't enjoy it, but I was expecting something more coherent from it. I enjoyed Kiki's Delivery Service and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind a whole lot more. But that's just my opinion. Anyway, back to our regularly scheduled programming. Gintama truly is a product that can only be comprehended by the brilliant among us. As for those haters; What fools... how I pity them. :joy: And yes by the way, I DO have a Gintama tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.",

Hating on me is just giving me power so I'm not the enemy here you guys are, everyone has to put up with haters all the time and all you have to do is just say something mean and hurtful and then block them. Plus everytime I said something like \"I wanna fart on them\" it was just a way for me to troll you. It wasn't a creepy fetish or anything I just wanted to annoy you and it worked. If you just ignored me and pretended I didn't exist than that would mean I was losing. I've had to put up with alot more annoying people than me for 6 fucking years(mark my words school is so overrated so many rotten teenagers) So in the end I don't care what you people say about me if I ever offended you, called you retarded, and disrespected your opinion than I think you deserved it. I said those things because it was personal and so I could stick up for myself(when I'm not on the internet I'm not nice or mean either I'm just a normal neutral guy) So good riddance you immature morons I wish all of you the worst of luck and may god have mercy on your souls.",

When I was like 14 I would wonk my willy in the bathroom and one day I  was sitting on the toilet seat and finished on the ground. My dumbass  forgot to clean it up and my mom went into the bathroom after me. She  slipped on my mess and broke her ankle. Me and my dad run into the  bathroom because she's screaming in pain and we see her sitting on the  floor holding her foot and my babybatter is literally between her bare  toes. At first my mom thought it was shampoo until my dad started  busting out laughing. My mom wasn't amused and told me how nasty I was  for not cleaning up. I want to crawl into a ball and die every single  time this incident gets brought up. Also my dad called my mom chunky  toes for years after this. TL;DR I didn't clean up my mess after jerking  off and my mom slipped in my cum and broke her ankle and earned the nickname chunky toes.",

    "self_text": "I walk into the above-average sized Subway, my demeanor showing my pure superiority as I saunter into the store with full intention of knowing what I will do.  Approaching the counter, I smugly request a dozen Subway brand white chocolate chip macadamia nut cookies, and watch the conflagration of panic enter the employee's eyes.  Already I can see the mental process they are going through, them forming a solid mental image of breaking everything in a blazed panic, unable to comprehend or follow through with my order.  They, hurriedly and panicked, grabbed a handful of cookie bags from the adjacent counter, stuffing each bag with the appropriate number of Subway brand white chocolate chip macadamia nut cookies.  Staring at them with the superiority I had once again reclaimed, they once again panicked. Unable to figure out what else to do, they hurriedly grabbed the closest item, a stapler, and rapidly stapled 7-8 staples in the tops of the Subway cookie bags.   Of course, for a mere mortal, unable to comprehend the mere purpose behind my order, their reaction was totally justified. So overwhelmed by the sheer apparent absurdity of my order that they seem to have lost sense of their surroundings.  Fearly, they declare the price as being $7.50. Of course, I hand them a $20 bill, two quarters, a dime, and three pennies, watching as chaos once again unfolds in their minds as they try to count the change, hurriedly doing the math.   Receiving my change, I leave with my several bags of Subway brand white chocolate chip macadamia nut cookies, having ripped the employees' world asunder, once again reminded of the pure ascension I obtain from these divine trinkets of deliciousness.  \"Same time tomorrow?\" I ask, fully aware such a transaction would completely destroy their brain, as such an action would leave a mortal unable to comprehend any sense of reason behind it. \"Okay\", they responded, fear bulging from their glisteningly crying eyes, sweat staining their skin with the smell of mortal inferiority as I walk away. Poor mortals, for enlightenment is only reached upon ascension. In solace, I do know one thing:  I have won.  O, how I can barely even remember the days before coming into contact with Subway brand white chocolate chip macadamia nut cookies. Having to deal with mortal taste, submortal texture, and sin of all types.  Merely upon tasting into such a cookie, it has ascended my being to that of a higher level; any possible comprehension from a past self being completely lost.  Not only do I taste the cookie, but I taste all it was, and all it will be. Nay, I taste time itself. Such a cookie has elevated me to heights beyond even my wildest past mortal comprehension.  Even for the ones incapable of ascension, surely upon consuming such a cookie, their eyes must water with joy and body convulse with glee, having tasted a divine delicacy far beyond their mortal existence will ever take them.  If there exists a god, surely he must be made out of these Subway brand white chocolate chip macadamia nut cookies. It would be impossible to be anywhere higher-ascended than them, thus if any god had created existence, they must be made of the highest-ascendent. In such a way, it would be logical to consider these cookies as a sort of divinity; a trinket to ascension.  For perhaps that may be why mortals often fail to comprehend it; that they simply have not been enlightened by the absolute, the perfection that is the Subway brand white chocolate chip macadamia nut cookie.  I pity thee who hath not yet ascended due to its sheer glory; to such a day I could never hope to return.  Though many have asked why such an ascension would be placed at a \"simple shop\", I believe the answer is quite obvious:  To who would the trinket of ascension be priced so cheap at but common folk? Subway was divinely chosen as the altar for the gift of ascension; being an international brand capable of popularity without many negative connotations set in its stead. For happenstance, if it were set in a place such as McDonald's, it would instantly be stigmatized as being truly unhealthy and giving of insulin-based diseases. However, the absense of much negative commentary for Subway makes it an ideal resting place for the most divine gift.  Other questions entail asking why it not be free, should it allow such ascension? However, once again, the answer remains obvious: ascension will not help those who do not help themselves.  Being placed at a cheap price of $1, it requires little work. However, a $1 cost is enough to reliably assume you hold enough self-responsibility to responsibly use the ascension as you wish.  As remains the constant of the human condition, greed often controls the human spirit; rendering it incapable of processing thoughts not related to needing more of pleasure. As such, exercising even such a basic level of self-control as this is completely required for such a permission of ascension.  With such in your hearts, it must be unmistakably obvious as to why the ascension is so glorious, and such that your questions have already been answered, either by me, or by the part of you now wishing to join now.  This is truly a 10/10 cookie. I have seen life, I have seen death, I have seen everything else. Such concepts remain non-existent to me now, as even my sheer existence lies discontinuous from the spacetime you know.  Such an existence is one of pure blissful ascension. Would recommend.",

    "self_text": "NOTE: I, YodaJeff, am not the original author of this paper. I happened to find it online a while back, and unfortunately the site is no longer up. This gets a little hard to follow after a while. If this is too confusing, read a simpler version here. Good luck, and enjoy! by Unknown Author This was a paper I wrote for my Linguistics II class. It's not meant to be taken as the textbook for speaking like Yoda. It's also based only on my rudimentary skills as a linguistic analysis. None of the following is taken from anything written by Lucas except for the direct quotations from the movies.  Several light years from Earth, the swamp planet of Dagobah is the home of Yoda. This two-foot tall reptilian and his home are the creations of George Lucas. Yoda speaks English words but demonstrates his own unique grammar structure.  Yoda's grammar depends on the intent of the sentence and while he follows his grammar for the most part, his operator, or script writer does make a few errors but for the purposes of this study, this collective shall be referred to only as 'Yoda.\" On the whole, Yoda follows a fairly standard structure. His particular grammar shall henceforth be referred to as \"Yodish\". As with any grammar structure, there are exceptions to the rules. It is my intent to elaborate on the rules of grammar in the phrases issued forth from the mouth of Yoda. I will be discussing the types of sentences involved in his speech, the phrase structure and the exceptions to his rules. For the sake of brevity, I will reduce the parts of speech to abbreviations: 'S' for subject, 'V' for verb, 'depV' for dependent verbs, 'Adj' for adjective, 'Adv' for adverb, 'con' for conjunction, 'pp' for preposition, 'DO' for direct object, 'IO' for indirect object, 'O' for objects as a whole, 'ObP' for object of a preposition, 'PM' for predicate modifier which I will use to refer to either a predicate nominative or predicate adjective, 'I' for interrogative terms, 'poss' for possessive, 'neg' for negation of a verb and in the case where a phrase may be used to substitute for a part of speech, I will identify the part of speech preceded by a p, for example, 'pDO' for a phrase acting as a direct object.  Yoda uses four basic sentence types: imperative, interrogative and declarative and I will consider the fourth structure to be that of the standard English vernacular structure (hereafter SEV) which are often, but not always exceptions to the structure of Yodish.  I will discuss the fourth sentence type first, SEV structures in the Star Wars Trilogy Yoda scenes. SEV sentences are used by Yoda when it is especially important that the non-Yodish speaker understand him. A large group of samples exist and most, if not all of them could be translated into Yodish. Many of these are in response to a question put forth by Luke Skywalker, a non-Yodish speaker, and therefore the response is in SEV. Aside from this consideration, there seems to be no rhyme or reason regarding why these particular sentences are spoken as SEV rather than Yodish aside from the importance of their content to plot. It seems that the ignorance of the character of Luke as well as the ignorance of the audience was taken into special consideration when scripting these particular sentences. In this reasearchers method, these samples have been disregarded.  Declarative sentences are the most common of sentences in any language. This is no less true in Yodish than in SEV. Yodish makes use of the same parts of speech as in SEV and makes use of the same phrase structures, including prepositional phrases, relative clauses which are used in place of various parts of speech, dependent phrases and independent phrases. Yodish involves simple sentences, complex sentences, compound sentences and complex-compound sentences of varying degrees of complexity.  One point of interest regarding Yodish is that speakers are capable of creating a sentence without benefit of subject, without benefit of verb or without benefit of both the former and the latter. The majority of such sentences have either a subject or a verb with modifiers. One of the subject-only sentences is: \"Great warrior\" (Adj + S) and the absence of parts pattern continues with a verb-only structure: \"Cannot get your ship out\" (depVneg+V+poss+DO+Adv). He makes things more complex when he creates sentences without benefit of subject or verb as in the example: \"Much anger in him like his father\" (Adj+PM+Pp+ObP+con+poss+O?). Another example of this structure is seen in \"Only different in your mind\" (Adv+Adj+pp+poss+ObP) which, in SEV would be: \"It is only different in your mind\" in which the phrase as a whole would act as a predicate modifier. The majority of these structures, in SEV would behave as predicate modifiers and would be in the position of predicate modifiers. Also, it is of some importance to note that much of Yodaish is punctuated by random 'yeses' and 'hmmmms' and 'awwws'. This is simply a mode of punctuation and appears to serve no conclusive purpose.  One of the more simple sentences provided in the samples of Yodish is a simple sentence which contains a direct object. In many cases, the direct object begins the simple phrase and is then repeated in the position of a normal SEV object, within the verb phrase. One sample, taken from Yoda is, \"Yoda, you seek Yoda\" and \"Rest, I need rest\" both of which follow the (DO+S+V+DO (repeated) pattern. However, while this is appropriate when this is the extent of the complexity as when we say in SEV, \"I want the dog\" or \"Suzy bought a necklace\" without modifiers, it does not continue in the same pattern if we add modifiers to the verb, either by adding an adverb or a dependent verb. The aforementioned sentences would be rephrased in Yodish as \"the dog, I want the dog\" or \"A necklace, Suzy bought a necklace\" If we add modifiers, as in the case of \"Friends you have there\" which adds 'there' as an adverb (DO+S+V+Adv), then another structure is applied which will be discussed later. We will find, however, tha the placement of the adverb, is in error. If we add a dependent verb to the verb as in the case of \"Found someone you have...\" by adding 'have' as the dependent verb, we get (V+DO+S+depV) which follows the structure described next.  Another of the more simple structures in Yodish is one which contains a verb and dependent verb. In such cases, the two are separated by other parts of speech involved. In Yodish, this structure exists in several samples, even as independent clauses in nonsimple sentences. In Return of the Jedi, Yoda says, \"...suffer your father's fate you will\" (V+poss+poss+DO+S+depV). In Empire Strikes Back, he states, \"Consume you it will...\" (V+DO+S+depV) as well as \"Take you to him I will\" (V+DO+pp+ObP+S+ depV). After examining several examples like this which are consistent with this pattern, it may be determined that this is the normal structure and not an exception. Thus, the standard pattern where dependent and regular verbs are used, they are separated by objects, subjects and adjectives describing the objects and subjects. Prepositional phrases may follow after the second of the two verbs or enter into the sentence after the first of the verbs in an appropriate placement according to the part of speech which they modify as they would in SEV. This independent clause should usually end with the subject and dependent verb as long as the active verb is placed before the subject. Applying these rules, created sentences might be: \"Buy the dog John will for Sue,\" or \"Help you I would if I could\" However, when applied in conjunction with use of a predicate modifier of the subject, the separation of dependent and primary verbs rule remains intact but slightly reversed. A predicate modifier will always precede the remainder of the structure with the exception of the presence of an adverb and be placed at the front of an independent clause as in the case of \"... then a Jedi will you be\" (Adv+PM+depV+sub+ state of beingV) In application, this means that the rule of V+O+S+depV reverses the roles of dependent verb and main verb. We see more examples of these structures from Yoda himself, but in application of these rules, we can create sentences such as: \"A teacher will I be\" (PM+depV+S+V) or \"Soon parents will Sharon and Eric be\" (Adv+PM+depV+S+V).  At times, however, the predicate modifier will not require dependent verbs at all and only the state-of-being verb, (hereafter \"beingV\") is required. For this case, a new rule is required. In Yodish, I reiterate, the modifier must precede the subject and the state-of-being verb which may or may not be reversed. So, we hear such clauses from Yoda as: \"Strong you are...\" (PM+S+ beingV) as well as \"...reckless is he\" (PM+beingV+ S). A prepositional phrase which would modify the predicate modifier when the modifier is an adjective will follow after the state of being verb as with: \"Strong you are in what you have learned\" (PM+S+ beingV+pAdj). If we have a predicate modifier which is a predicate nominative and it in turn is modified by an adjective, whether an adjective alone or a phrase acting as an adjective, the adjective follows directly behind the nominative as in the sentence: \"A domain of evil it is\" (PM-nominative+pAdj+S+beingV). In creative application of these predicate modifier rules we may see sentences such as: \"Your sister is she\" or \"Blue is the house.\" It is of interest to note that when there are multiple predicate modifiers, the series is separated. Only one modifier is placed at the beginning of the clause and the multiples are placed after the S/V structure. In these cases we see structures such as \"Sick have I become, old and weak\" (PM+depV+S+beingV+PMseries) or \"Unexpected this is, and unfortunate\" (PM+S+beingV+remainder of PMseries).  This brings me to the issue of the adverb or adverbial phrase. Adverbs begin clauses in which they are used as in the sample phrases: \"When gone am I...\" (Adv+PM+V+S) or \"...a long time have I watched\" (pAdv+depV+S+V). These structures follow the previously established rules of verb seperation and predicate modifier placement (depV+S+V) and (PM+beingV+S). So it follows that in the case of requirement of an adverb, the adverb begins any clause structure and all other pertinent rules apply.  Now we come to the problem of 'do' in connection with the negation of the verb. In negative cases, the predicate modifier rules as well as the lone-verb placement rules become obsolete. The subject begins the clause and the verb follows then objects and their modifiers follow the verb. In cases which in SEV would be S+'do'+neg+V the structure becomes S+V+neg without benefit of 'do'. 'Do' is not required. The verb is negated by the placement of 'not' following the verb. Several samples of this structure exist. We hear from Yoda: \"Wars make not one great\" (S+V+neg+DO+Adj) and \"A Jedi craves not these things\" (S+V+neg+pDO).  Negation is also involved in the two final issues of Yodish declarative structures. Yoda makes a number of statements in which he negates his entire preceding independent clause. We have as samples, \"I will help you not\" and \"Size matters not\". Aside from the fact that the structures, aside from the placement of 'not', are either pattern errors or representative of structures of which there is too little data to discuss, the 'not' seems to negate the entire preceding statement as the 'not' does when placed at the end of an SEV valley-slang standard negation phrase. This holds true in the clause, \"look as good you will not\" (V(non 'being')+PM+S+depV+ neg). This follows the previously discussed verb separation rules and a predicate modifier rule which seems to appear when the verb is not a state-of-being verb. Applying rules in such a case we might produce sentences such as \"Always a teacher she was not\" (Adv+PM+S+ beingV+neg) or \"Drive Suzy to the mall I will not\" (V+DO+pp+S+depV+ neg) or \"Take the dog for a walk Bill will not\" (V+DO+pp+S+depV+neg).  Finally, in the way of declaratives, if something does not exist, such as \"try\" as Yoda says or \"snicklefritz\" as I say, the statement is created according to the S+V pattern of SEV. However, the verb is simply 'is' and it is negated by a 'no', meaning 'it isn't'. Then the word for that which doesn't exist follows. As a study sample we may examine \"There is no why\" (S+V+no+x) said by Yoda. The 'x' represents that which does not exist. This is what I call the negative existence pattern.  There are a number of cases in each area where Yoda makes an error in his sentence production. He applies the direct object first placement rule inappropriately for two of the sentences he wishes to create. He says: \"My own counsel will I keep ...\" (pDO+depV+S+V) and \"Nothing more will I teach you today\" (pDO+depV+S+V+O+ Adv). In order to follow the rules of dependent verb and verb separation by the subject with a direct object and indirect object and the rules of time indicative adverb, these sentences are phrased inappropriately. They ought to be phrased, \"Keep my own counsel I will...\" (V+pDO+S+depV) and \" Today teach you nothing more I will\" (Adv+V+IO+ DO+S+depV). Yoda makes a verb separation error in Empire Strikes Back, saying: \"Through the force, things you will see...\". If Yodish rules had been applied correctly, this sentence should have been, \"Through the force see things you will\" (pAdv+V+DO+S+depV) Yoda also makes errors in his use of predicate modifiers. At one point he uses the SEV S+beingV+PM formation instead of his own PM+S or V+V or S structure. He says, \"Now matters are worse\" (Adv+S+beingV+ PM) instead of \"Now worse are matters\" (Adv.+PM+beingV+S) or \"Now worse matters are\" (Adv+PM+S+beingV), either of which would be acceptable. One particular sentence which Yoda produces violates a number of rules: \"Anger, fear, aggression, the dark side of the force easily does flow\" However, in this case, an exception may be made. There is no conceivable manner to include the words Yoda chooses and apply all of the given rules regarding predicate modifiers, do, verb separation and adverb placement.  Questions are a smaller class to discuss. The questions of Yodish are divided into five basic areas. The first one I will draw attention to is the simplest to define. As with declarative sentences, in Yodish, only one word is necessary and it doesn't matter what part of speech it is intended to be. In this case, the word is a verb, \"Looking?\" voiced with an inquisitive intonation. Several examples can be derived following this pattern: Ugly? You? Going? Here?  Another kind of interrogative is the case in which a question is phrased to ask about the modifying of the subject, in SEV called a predicate nominative or adjective. An interrogative with this intent is phrased in a predicate modifier-state-of-being verb- subject pattern (PM+beingV+S). The questioning is dependent on intonation yet again. \"So certain are you?\" (PM+beingV+S) and \"Ready are you?\" (PM+beingV+S) both follow this pattern. There is minimal data to examine so there is room for skepticism, however, I choose to assume that this data, although limited, is representative of the standard formation. So if I am to ask, in Yodish, if something is x, I would follow this pattern. Applying this rule, if I were to ask if Luke is a Jedi, I would say: \"A Jedi is Luke?\" To ask if Zoe is a master teacher, I would say: \"A master teacher is Zoe?\" Then, to ask if you are finished with a meal, I would say: \"Finished with your meal are you?\"  The third form of interrogative includes the technique of beginning a question with an interrogative word such as who, what, where, when, why or how. The basic structure when one of these words is placed at the beginning of the structure is that of Interrogative word-Verb-subject (I+V+S) then followed by a variety of other structures which modify either the subject or the verb. If the question relates to the subject and requires a predicate modifier or an object, this base formation is followed by state-of- being verb - predicate or prepositional phrase/object (I+V+S+depV+ PM/DO), as in the following sentences: \"Why wish you become Jedi?\"(I+V+S+depV+ PM); \"What know you of ready?\"(I+V+S+depV+ DO). Again, as with the declarative sentences, 'do' as a dependent verb is thrown out and 'to' as a verbal indicator is removed. If the sentence is intended to inquire regarding the verb, then an adverb formation is used but inserted between the interrogative word and the verb as with the sentence, \"How far Jedi was he?\" The adverb retains its same position as in the declarative instances but after the interrogative. Thus, the structure involving an adverb is Interrogative-adverb structure- verb-subject (I+Adv+V+S).  Imperatives are another limited data sample to discuss. Again, limited data is available in this case and therefore room is available for speculation. I shall treat these samples as representative of the rules of Yodish. Again, as with declaratives and interrogatives, there are different cases, in this class two exist. The first is the case of 'must'. When this variable is introduced to make a normal sentence an imperative this structure becomes identical to its sister structure in SEV. In any case where the word 'must' is in order the pattern is S+must+V+object. We find this structure in four samples. Three of the four follow this pattern: \"You must complete the training\"(S+must+V+O); \"You must unlearn what you have learned\" (S+must+V+ pO) and \"You must feel the force around you\"(S+must+V+pO). The next several sentences would exist in Yodish if we apply the rules just outlined. \"Leia must find the planet\" (S+must+V+O), \"Han must rescue Chewbacca\" (S+must+V+O) and \"He must find his father\" (S+must+V+O). In the fourth sample, there is no object but the verb is negated. Unlike the negated sentences in the declarative class, the negative is is placed before the verb as in SEV: S+must+neg+V. This structure is exemplified in the phrase, \"You must not go\" (S+must+neg+V). In application, this structure may be seen in the following original sentences. \"Larry must not eat\" (S+must+neg+V), \"The boy must not run\" (S+must+neg+V) and \"You must not sleep\" (S+must+neg+V).  Five samples exist of the second class of imperatives, the class in which the 'you' is understood. This class is usually a command, a direction to be immediately fulfilled. Four of the five data samples follow the same structure as in the following sentence spoken by Yoda: \"Feel the force flow, yes\" (V+pDO+Affirmative). Yoda often applies the 'yes' term or 'no' term in order to indicate approval or disapproval with the execution of the command. This class is altered when an adverb comes into use. When an adverb is required, as in the sentence: \"Now the stone, feel it\" (Adv+DO+V+restateDO), the adverb begins the sentence and the direct object must be mentioned before the verb and then reiterated. There is still only the understood 'you' as the subject. In application, the first set of this class of imperatives are the same as in SEV. Sentences such as \"Lift the box\" (V+DO) and \"Get the dog\" (V+DO) are quite possible. The approval statement may be applied in the case of \"Pull the cord, yes\" (V+DO+affirmative) or \"Kick the ball, no\" (V+DO+negative approval). In the latter example, the no would indicate disapproval of the manner in which the ball was kicked. The second set, the adverb addition is a bit different from SEV, but not a great deal. We might produce sentences such as \"First the girl, kiss her\" (Adv+DO+V+restatedDO) or \"Quickly the dog, buy it\" (Adv+DO+V+restatedDO).  Yodish, the language of Yoda of Star Wars fame is quite similar to that of our standard English. The words he uses are the same as those we use. They are intended to be used for the same purpose or part of speech. His language contains the same phrase structures and if enough applications are made, it is likely that infinite combinations are possible. Yodish is not an arbitrary grammar which simply confuses that of SEV willy-nilly but there is a standard pattern of rules which are applied, though not likely purposefully designed by creator George Lucas. If this were the case, the errors I have mentioned would very likely not exist nor would the fourth class of sentences, that of the SEV structures used for clarity of understanding. There are some exceptions to these rules, but we can apply the rules of Yodish and create an everyday language and therefore, Yodish is a legitimate language, or in the grammar of Yoda, \"A legitimate language is Yodish, yes. Hmmm.\"",

She very clearly liked me and seemed to be giving me “the look” left right and center. I honestly lost count of the amount of times she laughed at things that I said and she seemed to genuinely enjoy talking to me. We ended up chatting for nearly 3 hours, and most of our conversation wasn’t even remotely about Yale—just random things about ourselves. Towards the end of the interview, I had a strange urge to go in for a kiss. It’s as though I completely forgot that this was an interview for college, and my desires got the best of me. I guess I completely misread the situation too, as she immediately shouted “what are you doing?” as I was about to go in for it. I instantly apologized and we kind of ended things awkwardly then and there. I am really stressed out now about the repercussions of this; I put a lot of work into my Yale application and it would really suck if it gets fucked because of this. Am I screwed?  TL;DR: Tried to kiss my Yale interviewer at the end of our conversation. I massively fucked up.  Edit: I just emailed my interviewer and both thanked her for the conversation and apologized again profusely. Not sure if there’s anything else I can do at this point. ☹️  Edit 2: The fact that people think it’s a shitpost is only making me realize more and more just how much I’ve fucked up…",

    "self_text": "Who I am? (Please read this before engaging in conversations with me)  I highly recommend that you, dear redditor reading this, get some snacks and a cool drink, for this is going to be a long text. Moreover, you should consider following me, unless you want to miss all the intellectual content I post and be another worthless sheep minded redditor. Also, don't feel bad for yourself if you can't keep up with my deep and complicated thoughts. Not everyone is born a genius. Having said that, let's begin~  I used to depict myself as \"a humble mind on this godforsaken website\", but I've come to realise that I'm far more than that. After engaging in countless discussions and debates with other redditors I have come to realize that I'm on a different level. I'm better. Smarter. You are not and will never be on my intellectual level. Yes, I know this sounds very arrogant, but it's the simple hard truth. The amount of stupidity I come across in this app is beyond belief. Statistically, my intelligence is far, far higher than the average redditor.   You may be wondering, why waste my time here then? A smart and handsome man like me surely has a lot of other things to invest his precious time on? You are correct. I have many personal projects but I've decided to put these on hold. Why? Because I, not long ago, had a revelation.  Unlike most humans who only care about shopping, having girlfriends or going to parties, I've always been worried about much more complex issues. One of them is death. Inevitably and mercilessly, it gets us all. Rich, poor, stupid, intelligent, The Grim Reaper doesn't care.  The clock is ticking and it doesn't stop. One day I will die. My thoughts and ideas will die, and even if I become an important political figure, with enough time I will be forgotten. When I realized this, I panicked. Mankind simply can't afford to forget me. But I'm a real man, and unlike most redditors when facing a problem, instead of running away, I started working on a solution. And what solution do you think I've come up with? I will save reddit. Rebuild it. Purge it from all the stupidity and bigotry.  You are probably asking yourself, why Reddit of all things? Why not start a charity organisation, or a new philosophical movement?  Because my innocent redditor, the Internet is the future of mankind. And for the best or for the worst, Reddit is the front page of the Internet. I will leave my mark here. I'm Empereor Vespasiano and Reddit will be the Colosseum. Ages will pass, wars will start and end, frontiers and languages may change, but my supreme creation, the new Reddit, will keep on illuminating people for centuries, if not, forever. I am the light you were searching for. I am your savior.  Accept your place in the new reddit, and your pathetic life might start to get better. I will open your eyes. The world is very different from what you think.  #I am the key to forbidden knowledge. Will you open the door, or would you rather die in ignorance?  Edit: ENOUGH with the hate comments and trolls. I've already got more than 30 of you worthless redditors  permanently  banned, via reporting, for breaking Reddit TOS. This is my last warning, comment at your own risk. /uj -  Serius .  Edit 2: For all the people flooding my DMs, please keep in mind I can't respond to everyone. Stating what you want to talk about / if you are a woman can greatly increase the chances of your message being responded. Trolls and haters will be blocked and reported instantly, so don't even try.",

I went to a couple rallies and I donated a decent some of money to his campaign. On election night, I was watching the coverage with my gf at the time, who was a hardcore hildog supporter (out of politics, she was a pretty cool chick so we didn't have any issues). When it became apparent hilary was going to lose, she started to lose her shit and was getting real mouthy. I tried to calm her down to no avail. She eventually said \"Trump supporters are going to pay for what they've done today!\" so I responded with \"start with me, you stupid bitch!\" The dumb whore slapped me across my face. Once this cunt realized what she did, her face turned paler than a ghost. I chuckled and let off a slight grin, then I cold-cocked her right in the face. She dropped to the floor instantly and I grabbed her by the hair and started to smash her face into the phucking floor. The neighbors heard her screaming and called the cops. I wound up getting five-years in prison. I got out in 2021 just to find our Trump didn't build the wall, he didn't drain the swamp, Hilary wasn't in prison, cucked on aid to Israel, and was another chickenhawk with his intervention in Syria and Iran. I went to prison defending this snake, so it's pretty epic ftw seeing the republicucks crashing and burning right now, not to mention Trump's going to be indicted in two more weeks. I obviously can't vote, but I live in a state with loose voter ID laws. My geriatric father has the same name as me, so I used his name at the polling station and voted blue down the line.

Looking to your side, you see a tall, green figure with a large nose and strange ears. “Welcome to my swamp, laddeh. I’ve been waiting for ya.”",

Christ the only rod you ignorant swine know jack shit about is the one you stroke out to anthropomorphic plane hentai. If you took not even a tenth of a percent of the time you spend studying degenerate weeb garbage and instead skimmed the barest hint of orbital mechanics you would understand that R * ds from G * d are fucking moronic.   ⁠The only thing harder to get up the earth’s enormous gravity well than your fat asses is a tungsten telephone pole that weighs 100 fucking tons. I mean seriously who in their right minds thinks that that’s a feasible weapon. It costs a billion dollars just for Boeing to fuck up a suborbital capsule test, you think the space force is gonna pay 25x that just so some dipshitter can drop it on a cave dwelling insurgent? Fuck no.  ⁠How, in your tiny corn fed minds, do you think this thing would be controlled? The microsecond it hits atmosphere it’s gonna be in a signal blocking plasma sheath almost as big as a Reddit mod. If your target isn’t completely dead still and is smaller than a football field there is no fucking chance you actually hit where in the Sam hell shit you aimed for ALL THE WAY BACK UP IN ORBIT. And even if your Middle Eastern dictator of choice is not bouncing around in a Toyota rendering all of this preparation useless, and his command bunker is nice and large, we still get to our last problem:  ⁠THE THING IS LESS POWERFUL THAN A NORMAL FUCKING BOMB. Seriously, just use a normal bunker buster for normal people you undermedicated squibs. The pole only has the velocity of earths orbit, which is the maximum amount of energy that can be imparted in your stupid sci-fi chunderweapon, even before it loses half of that speed lighting up the ozone layer like Martha Stewart on a candle binge. A normal bomb of the same size is WAAAAAYYYYY more powerful and useful. And it also isn’t completely skullfucked in your MIC Defense Department Rube Goldberg jerk fest.   Which brings us to our final point: why go to all this trouble to make a “not really nuclear weapon” when you can quit being a pussy and just use a nuclear weapon instead? I mean what do all you asinine brainlets think the rational reaction to this thing is? Is Putin gonna take a peak at the GIGANTIC REENTRY TRAIL overhead and think, “hmm looks like the Americans are using a new kinetic impactor system”? OF FUCKING COURSE NOT. Any sane human would immediately go fucking apeshit about the apparent nuclear first strike inbound and trigger an immediate response, making all of this non-nuclear shenaniganry useless.  The Air Force didn’t make this shit for a reason, go back to huffing glue and SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU SUBHUMAN MORONS.",

    "self_text": "PART 1  Infinite cum. You sit on the toilet to jack off, but you begin to cum uncontrollably. After ten spurts you start to worry. Your hand is sticky and it reeks of semen. You desperately shove your dick into a wad of toilet paper, but that only makes your balls hurt.    The cum accelerates.    It’s been three minutes. You can’t stop cumming. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of baby fluid. You try to cum into the shower drain but it builds up too fast. You try the toilet. The cum is too thick to be flushed. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cum from escaping. The air grows hot and humid from the cum.    The cum accelerates.    You slip and fall in your own sperm. The cum is now six inches deep, almost as long as your still-erect semen hose. Sprawled on your back, you begin to cum all over the ceiling. Globs of the sticky white fluid begin to fall like raindrops, giving you a facial with your own cum.    The cum accelerates.    You struggle to stand as the force of the cum begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a bukkake themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cum is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of man juice reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with cum instead of molasses.    The cum accelerates.    It’s been two hours. Your children and wife scream in terror as their bodies are engulfed by the snow-white sludge. Your youngest child goes under, with viscous bubbles and muffled cries rising from the goop. You plead to God to end your suffering.    The cum accelerates.    You squeeze your dick to stop the cum, but it begins to leak out of your asshole instead. You let go. The force of the cum tears your urethra open, leaving only a gaping hole in your crotch that spews semen. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the cum. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird’s eye view you see your house is completely white. Your neighbor calls the cops.    The cum accelerates.    As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray loads of cum hit them in the eyes, blinding them.    The cum accelerates.    You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. Hundreds of bullets pierce your body at once, yet you stay conscious. Your testicles have now grown into a substitute brain.   The cum accelerates. It has been two days. With your body now destroyed, the cum begins to spray in all directions. You break the sound barrier. The government deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cum sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the earth. You feel your gonads start to burn up as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new white paint job as you fly past. Physicists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The cum accelerates. The cum begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of semen. Astronomers begin calling you the “Cummet.” You are stuck in space forever, stripped of your body and senses, forced to endure an eternity of cumshots. Eventually, you stop thinking.  &#x200B;  PART 2  Your eyes slowly open. Crusty from months of wear from stray globs of semen and cosmic dust. You are in a room and you can no longer see your member, or rather, what was left of it. There are tubes leading away from your pelvis, pumping and pulsating. There is a glass window across from you and a person dressed in a white jacket. A woman. She looks up from her clipboard to see you are awake. At first she is uninterested, but then her eyes slam open and a beaming smile crosses her face. Her eyes filled with curiosity.  “You’re awake!” She cries over the loudspeakers that you only just now notice embedded into the top corners of the room.  “Where am I?” You ask, filled with fear and excitement. You thought you would never see a human again and you would be destined to suffer endlessly across the cosmos.  “You are on Saturn. You crashed into it and due to it’s extreme mass you were able to stop. We picked you up because you may be the key to saving humanity for all eternity.”  “How?” You ask as a smile begins to creep across your face, imagining that you could be an icon for humanity.  “You have been addressed as the Cosmic Unknown Mass Semen Generator, or CUMS-G for short. The fault in reality that caused your affliction can be used for the good of humanity.  By using the mass you produce we will never have to worry about energy again, as by converting your biomass into energy we have unlimited power for the rest of time. When the stars die and the cosmos sink into nothing, humanity will be able to continue thanks to you. The anomaly that created you is easily one of the greatest discoveries humanity has ever had, on par with the discovery of fire.”  “Will I not die?”  “You can’t die. You are immortal. You don’t even have a body and yet you continue to exist”  …  Hours later, she leaves to tell her superiors. They do not greet you. They exchange high-fives and party but they do not speak to you.  Months pass.  The cum accelerates.  Then years.  The cum accelerates.  Then decades.  The cum accelerates.  Then centuries.  The cum accelerates.  Then eons.  The cum accelerates.  No one talks to you. You don’t even know if humanity is alive anymore or if they have left you to exist for the rest of eternity.  The tubes around you have gotten far thicker and more high tech as the ferocity of your semen expulsion increased.  Eventually the walls around you cave in. Only then do you see the truth.  Their plan was flawed.  Your release had increased so much that they could no longer contain you. Your cum has consumed the entirety of the cosmos. Humanity is without a shred of doubt, gone.  You are alone in the universe.  If there were aliens, they are dead now.  It’s over.  In despair, you mourn the death of the scientists, of humanity, of everyone. You realize you'll never hear her sweet and calming voice, see her proud body.  Your sad. Your terrified. Chronicles pass. The last stars in the universe eclipse. You silently watch as the last atoms break into protons, into quarks, into mere beams of weak energy that disperse along the vertical ropes. But the ropes no longer play their docile music. They have gonne silent.  You watch, helplessly, as the Last mozon is engulfed into the ever expanding plane of Cum. Your own creation destroys the very own universe, defying the own plan of existence.  You are alone.  You scream, but nothing comes out of your mouth. You cry, but nothing descends from your eyes. Do you even have eyes? All you can see is the torrid Instotucional white across the whole of the Universe. Entire Gans eclipse before your eyes, but then you realize the horror: The Cum turned against you.  With nothing more to consume, your sons turned against their father, and begin to consume you. You tremble. There's nothing to do. The huge weight impacts you like if whole planets fell onto your shoulders. Your alone. In your last moments, a odd sentiment of peace invades you for the first time since the early days of the universe. It's finally gonna end. You think about all the people that you've met during your stay in this universe. In the end, you think about the researcher. About her arms. Her breasts. You feel... good. For the first time in many hipereons. You jack off it.  It's so.... good, you come at the right time, freeing the constrained cum from your menber. You open your eyes, and behold the bathroom door.  You are Ok. You remember everything. It's all over.  You exit the bathroom after jacking off again, going back to your old life.  The cum stops.  PART 3  The cum finally collapses in on itself. Unknown time has passed since the eternal cum started.  Entire civilizations have been built and sustained on the cum. Entire species have been born and died in their cum cocoons. Quadrillions of years after the last stars have died and the last black holes have dissipated, there is only cum.   The cum accelerates   All the cum based life forms realize their end is near, as the cum races toward the edges of reality itself.   The cum accelerates   The only life forms to survive this universe do so by leaving the dimension completely.   The cum accelerates   The machines are growing old and beginning to fail. Cum pushes against the dimensional boundary of reality. Everything finally collapses. Endless aeons of cumming have propelled you to the absolute center of mass. Pressure builds near the core from the center and outside at the same time. Eventually, it all collapses at once.   The cum accelerates   The entire universe full of cum rushes in on itself as the cum accelerates one last time. Your entire existence has been cum forever, you have forgotten what it was like not to cum. Existence is a tormented perpetual bliss of ever increasing orgasm, each moment more intense than the last so you just barely can't get used to it, even as your final moment approaches. Yet, at your final moment, you finally experience clarity. Such clarity that you are finally able to understand again. You understand everything. You understand that you are the source of reality, doomed to repeat this cycle once more. One last planet sized drop shoots out with enough pressure to destroy the machinery holding you hostage.  The cum temporarily stops  The universe rushes in on you.  The collapse triggers a new big bang  You just came inside the universe and created a new one  You are now god  Eventually, you see the universe starting to fade away and cool. Entropy is winning. Life won't last like this. You decide to cum again. It was all worth it, seeing the beauty of the life you created. You decide to endure this eternal torment once more.  You transfer your entire being into a new body, and are born into a new family. You grow up and live life, get married, etc.....  And one day, you decide to jerk off. You find the perfect video and begin to stroke. Your memory of the past universe and endless agony is gone by your own choice, ever since the moment you decided to repeat the cycle and became mortal.  And you cum again. The street floods as you propel into space and the cycle continues, sustaining all life in the cosmos once again.",

    "self_text": "5 monkeys were placed in a cage as part of an experiment. In the middle of the cage was a ladder with bananas on the top rung. Every time a monkey tried to climb the ladder, the experimenter sprayed all of the monkeys with icy water. Eventually, each time a monkey started to climb the ladder, the other ones pulled him off and beat him up so they could avoid the icy spray. Soon, no monkey dared go up the ladder. The experimenter then substituted one of the monkeys in the cage with a new monkey. The first thing the new monkey did was try to climb the ladder to reach the bananas. After several beatings, the new monkey learned the social norm. He never knew “why” the other monkeys wouldn’t let him go for the bananas because he had never been sprayed with ice water, but he quickly learned that this behaviour would not be tolerated by the other monkeys. One by one, each of the monkeys in the cage was substituted for a new monkey until none of the original group remained. Every time a new monkey went up the ladder, the rest of the group pulled him off, even those who had never been sprayed with the icy water. By the end of the experiment, the 5 monkeys in the cage had learned to follow the rule (don’t go for the bananas), without any of them knowing the reason why (we’ll all get sprayed by icy water). If we could have asked the monkeys for their rationale behind not letting their cage mates climb the ladder, their answer would probably be: “I don’t know, that’s just how it's always been done.”",

No one spoke anymore. Then, one brave soldier dares to write: \"AMONG US ISNT FUNNY STOP POSTING ABOUT AMONG US\". The chat goes crazy. Not only that message got well over 100 nerd emoji reactions, but it also got several replies with emojis that looked like among us. 📮⛔️ and 📛 were the most common. Everyone, and I mean everyone, was writing among us. Among us had invaded the chat. I was horrified. I went to cleanse my eyes, and then managed to get promoted to mod. I deleted all of the amonguses. I, infact, deleted all of the channels. I nuked them. I demoted everyone to user and before the owner could even notice it, the server was gone. I created a channel. A channel where only I (and the owner of course) could write. I wrote \"No more among us.\" Instantly, tens of thousands of reactions flooded my message. The owner goes online. He sees the server destroyed, with only that one message. I get banned. I join with an alt account. The server still didnt recover. Everything was destroyed. I successfully defeated among us. I never thought I'd be able to do something like that, but I did. I just did that. It was there in front of my eyes. I watch as the owner desperately tries to get some chats back, with the first being #general. Then, as soon as that chat was created, a message was sent. 0.0001 seconds later, another. In one single second, already 72 message were sent. Nothing could stop the confusion and anger of people who've saw a raid with their own eyes. Nothing. The owner slowly starts to readd roles. I offer to help, he gives me admin and I just managed to get my bot on the server again and to ban EVERYONE. Every-f*ing one. Only me and the owner were left. The owner bans me even on my alt. It was over. I managed to grab an invite before getting banned, so I login to my third alt, only to see that the invite wasnt working. The server was officially dead.",

She smiles.  \"Conversation with me,\" she replies in her flowing Mondstadt accent. I laugh.  \"What's so funny?\" she protests.  \"Nothing, nothing...

She looks up into my eyes with a smirk.  \"Discipline\", she says. Our eyes lock.  I lean in some more. She closes her eyes. Our faces draw close, and our lips embrace in a kiss.  \"Let's continue this conversation somewhere else\" I say, and hold Eula's hand as I lead her away from the party.",

Maybe some day, I’ll get to the point, where I have no care for anybody, whatsoever, and I’ll be thanking those that shaped me that way.

The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Lil Peep, but I think X has a far more varied, pleasant style of music.  Hey, Halberstram?  Yes, Allen?  Why are there copies of the Her Loss all over the place? Do you... Do you , like, fuck with Drake? Kee-Kee, so you love me or something?  No, Allen.  Is that a raincoat?  Yes, it is. In 2017, X released this; 17, his most accomplished album. I think his undisputed masterpiece is \"I spoke to the devil in miami, he said everything would be fine\". A song so underlooked, most people probably don't know it exists. But they should, because it's not just about the regrets of past actions and the importance of self forgiveness. It's also a personal statement about X himself. Hey, Paul!

While my wife sets up the DVR I need to take a quick shit before I sit down. I open the door gently, \"Are we ready?\" I asked excited, but instead of my wife I see 5 people surrounding my wife whos laying in a pool of blood. \"HONEY\" I yell as the first one rushed towards me crowbar in hand. I run towards the nearest door as he swings a crowbar and hits my back, hearing a rib shatter, but that didn't stop me. Racing him towards my fireplace as he gets me again with that absolute MEAT of a swing and takes out more of my ribs. I finally make it to the fireplace and pullout my gun, the man swings twice at me without saying a word and I took it as a \"COME ON PUNK\" so showing him i'm no bitch I unloaded 6 shots into his head and stomach, falls and I make my way towards the room where the rest are. The other tried a sneak attack but failed when I put a bullet in his sternum. The third one seemed to have second thoughts, screaming \"WE'RE ALL GONNA DI-\" cutting him off with 5 bullets making him swiss cheese. The punk fell in the corner crying as the fourth. seemingly, old man stared at me. I pointed my gun towards him and stepped closer, not a word spoken. He swung his crowbar once, persumably trying to deflect the bullet but i'm no amatuer to John Wick movies, so I shot three bullets incase he deflected the other two like Deadpool. The woman next to him showed no fear as I killed 4 of her colleagues and was charging her with pistol in hand. While holding a crowbar in her right hand she swung at me twice with her left hand. That was enough for me to call it 'Domestic violence' and was therefor okay to put a bullet in her neck which I did swiftly. Seeing all the blood and chaos that was swallowed my Friday night and no movie to speak of, I decided that the best way to clean it up was to make sure noone could recognize anything that happened, so I got my grenade that I bought at the swap meet last week and pulled the plug. My wife and me will continue to have movie nights, just not on this plane of existence\"",

We're going to get to fifty!!!\" Squidward is horrified at his own words. It sounds like he really needs the bathroom, and doesn't think he can do fifty. cut to Squidward inside the home depot with a 50 over his head. we never learn if he got to the bathroom or not, because right now he's stealing everything in sight (just grabbing it off the shelves, not hurting anyone or anything. no one even seems to notice.) every time he steals something, the number goes up. there's a montage of the number reaching towards 100 it cuts back to the beginning, before squidward had the number. He's falling asleep at the wheel of his box truck. it then cuts to the view of a car crash under a bridge, blood and bodies everywhere, a crash squidward feels responsible for, not knowing what truly caused it. The crash resulted in the death of several avengers, which is public knowledge, and that the truck was carrying drugs to a nearby prison to execute several inmates, which many of the avengers onboard were against, but still allowed to happen. What squidward doesn't know is that it was one of the avengers onboard going rogue to stop the executions, that caused the crash. The episode ends with squidward at a hundred. he's approached by a group of terrified fish gangsters. Squidward realises they fear him more than anything, and it's for one of his more mundane thefts: they say \"did you really steal that pack of gum?\" it's unclear if he stops because he reached 100, or because something about their reaction disappoints him, but he solemnly walks away, and I'm pretty sure the episode ends after that.",

    "title": "Walter White is a thoroughly Nietzschean hero, one of the few compelling examples of such figures that American culture has ever produced.",
    "self_text": "(Let's render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's: this copypasta is the work of u/HOWDEHPARDNER, and can be found here._)   Walter White is a thoroughly Nietzschean hero, one of the few compelling examples of such figures that American culture has ever produced. It was the philosopher Fried­rich Nietzsche who foresaw the predicament of Walter White, and of modern society, with uncanny clarity: We who inhabit modern societies are prone to a characteristic weakness, a pusillanimity in the face of the petty conventions and preoccupations of bourgeois existence. The fundamental challenge is to fashion a life that overcomes this debased condition, to rise from “last man” to “overman.” Some think that Nietzsche’s overman is an immoral, power-driven tyrant, who overcomes conventional morality by asserting a nihilistic will to power. But this is a misreading. Nietzsche’s overman rises above conventional morality not by embracing nihilism but by forging a narrative coherence to his life that issues in a kind of empowerment, or self-possession. The appeal of such empowerment, and of a hero who strives for it, is especially strong at this moment. In postrecession America, there is a mounting desire to throw off the straitjacket of a self-serving upper-middle-class morality that valorizes the sanctity of law and of “playing by the rules.” In many circles, there is a growing sense that the system is rigged, that the rules and conventions in place, defended in the name of fairness, efficiency, safety, or “win-win” economic arrangements, serve to empower some at the expense of others. Many find themselves enmeshed in absurd bureaucratic hierarchies—in work and in everyday life—that afford scant grounds for self-possession or self-respect. At the same time, there is a widespread sense that the “legitimate” economy fails to reward the effort and talents that ordinary people devote to their jobs. Instead, it heaps benefits on those who are simply lucky, or who manipulate the system, or who have a knack for getting rich off other people’s work (sometimes ruthlessly) while operating within the bounds of the law. People find themselves increasingly in the condition of Walter White—mired in routines of work that do not call forth their potential or accord them much dignity. Like Walt, many find themselves struggling to be recognized for the work they do, on the job or at home. It is against this cultural backdrop, I believe, that Breaking Bad still captivates public attention and illuminates the anxieties of our time. Nietzsche helps us interpret the improbable life story of Walter White and understand how Walt came to represent a kind of hero for this moment. Walt’s turn to crime is not simply a desperate move that spirals out of control—rather, it is a story of empowerment. In “breaking bad,” Walt rises to self-possession from a contemporary form of malaise and despair. Nietzsche also helps us understand the kind of self-possession Walt gains. On the surface, Walt’s trajectory might seem to suggest a grim, nihilistic drive to self-assertion through conquest: the way to truly live is to reject the social order in which you find yourself stifled and adopt a self-serving “live your own way” ethic. But this reading of Walter White is misguided. Walt does not simply despair of humanity and become a scornful manipulator of society who only enjoys domination over others. He is not the archetypal nihilist—like Roskolnikov from Crime and Punishment or Malvo from the re­cent TV series Fargo—who seeks destruction for its own sake. What makes Walt a complex protagonist, and what makes his tra­jectory moving, is that his “breaking bad” constitutes an attempt to forge a narrative coherence to his fractured and nearly expired life. Walt’s rise to power in the meth business can be understood, in Nietzschean terms, as an attempt to “redeem the past,” to reclaim a coherent whole out of the disparate parts of his life: his role as chemist, entrepreneur, husband, father, and even teacher. The self-possession for which he strives is thus bound up with a totality of commitments that cannot be captured by simple notions of egoism, selfishness, and conquest.  Nietzsche helps us diagnose the initial predicament of Walter White as the condition of the “last man,” a degenerate state of existence that Nietzsche identifies as pervasive in modern life. The last man, writes Nietzsche, enjoys “a little pleasure by day, and a little pleas­ure by night,” but always “with a regard to health.” The last man “has left the regions where it was hard to live” and ekes out an easy but hollow existence aimed at an ever-receding vision of repose. Absent from his life is any risk, adventure, or ambition: “‘What is love? What is creation? What is longing?’ Thus asks the last man, and he blinks.”1 Walter White is the last man, or very close to it. He is confined to a “little pleasure by day”—the breakfast of eggs, veggie bacon, and echinacea that his wife Skyler prepares for his fiftieth birthday—“a little pleasure by night”—the dispassionate, almost clinical hand job that she administers like medicine before bed—and all “with a regard to health.” Nietzsche’s “last man” captures a condition to which every life is susceptible. As we sympathize with Walter White, we acknowledge the possibility of the last man in ourselves. In one way or another, we’ve all been there before—in moments of enervation, lack of gumption, obsession with health, safety, and a long life, or earnest submission to the so-called necessities of a bourgeois existence. One of the brilliant conceits of Breaking Bad is its relentless exposure of the petty officiousness and stifling moralism of middle-class suburban life. The show constantly juxtaposes Walt’s harrowing travails and frank self-assertion in the underworld with the quotidian concerns and vapid, impersonal niceties of the law-abiding community. In extricating himself from the condition of the last man, Walt does not merely oppose his oppressive world with an angry “No!” He finds direction and rises to a kind of virtue that comes to light in Nietzsche’s conceptions of the “overman” and the “will to power.” Unfortunately, these key concepts are as liable to misinterpretation as Walter White himself. Due to misleading ideological appropriations of Nietzsche, and careless readings of his provocative aphorisms, we have a caricature of the “overman” as a kind of nihilistic lover of conquest who is above all ethics. But even a cursory reading of Nietzsche reveals a different conception. Even in his most “polemical” treatments of morality, as Nietzsche calls them, he makes clear that he seeks to promote one ethical framework over another, not to reject ethics in favor of “might makes right.” He seeks to replace a morality of weakness, timidity, and resentment with a morality of self-command. A first approximation of what Nietzsche means by “overman” is the passionate pursuit of life as an unfolding story: “What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not an end.”2 “Overman” is meant to point away from the “end,” the goal, the accomplishment, and toward the way. Life, Nietzsche suggests, is a ceaseless process of self-overcoming. “Overman” can thus be seen as a corrective to our “results-oriented” culture that interprets power as the capacity to get things done, to attain a certain standard of living, and to “make the world a better place.” To this extent, Nietzsche’s notion of overman is radi­cal and perhaps unsettling. Nietzsche sees in our obsession with accomplishment and progress a certain folly. He takes aim at the Enlight­enment view of providence that comes to paradigmatic ex­pression in Marx: the notion that humanity, through the technological mastery of nature, can solve the problem of scarcity and, through the attainment of a universal consciousness free of class difference and exploitation, bring about the perfectly just world.",

    "self_text": "I saw Jonathan Banks at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",

If you didn't sound like a pretentious asshole who thinks people should know what you consider simple  you would all be able to laugh about it once the individual is over the embarassement, because accidentally learning the wrong language is a funny mistake that will make a funny story, but while the mistake is still fresh you don't make fun of people and expect to not be seen as a total ass.",

If you were asked to chop an oak tree, you'd fail just for that, and even as broken as hell my base is, I still don't suffer from this \"lazy axe\" problem that you have created on your own. As such, I can effectively chop wood, stacking and transporting it without blunders like this, which could had been avoided if you actually took the time to actually use PROPER axes and stack wood like a NORMAL LUMBERJACK LIKE EVERY OTHER PROFESSIONAL AND AMATEUR LUMBERJACK WHO CHOPS WOOD IN THIS AREA GOD DAMMIT (except for me, but i already told you I'm an effective lumberjack despite my limitations).  I am 100% frustrated with how you still show a lack of care for using the  correct axes, and on top of that, using big fancy machines and contraptions to compensate for your lackluster skills.  I am 110% frustrated because you still use incorrect stacking after i've told and corrected for you over a day on your \"shitty stacking\", despite you knowing full and well that you just stacked incorrectly and knowing how to stack correctly, 9 times out of 10, and you choose not to because it's \"\"\"harder\"\"\" when in reality it is not.  Unless you're trying to intentionally piss me off, you have ZERO excuses for your lame shitass ineffective lumber skills, this is quite literally the worst i've seen you do in weeks, the others like \"i spent 50 grand on the worst lumber mill\" is minor traffic ticket compared to you've just done. You quite literally failed to lumberjack correctly, by not stacking lumber correctly and failing to use the correct axes out of an irrational fear of losing them  If i see you making another lumber blunder like this again, i'm going to do something.

I will never be able to face myself in the mirror because of the utter embarrassment I get from this action of mine. truly a terrible day for me and this event shall stick with me for the entire remainder of my life. I know that this is something I should've said sooner, and it likely doesn't mean much to you but I think it should be said. I'm sorry. To be more specific, I'm sorry about the pornographic image, and how I lied about it to try make myself look good, whilst lying to try make you look bad. A lot had occurred that day and it truly brought out the worst in me. When you began to message me about unmuting I took the opportunity to act like shit. First I had lied about you sending me gore for some stupid reason, and if it wasn't already too far I sent you porn. Not just any porn but porn of a underage character. Something that I'm completely against and do not support. I went onto Google, typed up something that would gross you out and copied the first result. Since then I've tried to improve myself and its still a journey I'm working on. At most I ask for you to forgive me, although I heavily understand and frankly would agree if you don't. Hell, feel free to mock me for this. I just wish to apologise for what I did. I've not read over this other than to fix spelling mistakes as this purely comes from the heart. I get that there were things you did as well but, I was the one that caused you to do so and take responsibility. sighs Hold on, I forgot the box of tissues. Longer, definitely real sigh Before I start today's apology, I just want to tell you, I have brand new #WeForgiveYouMerch available at LogangMerch.com. I made a severe whoopsie and continuous lapse in my judgment, and I don’t expect to be forgiven. I’m simply here to apologize. It was very unpoggers of me to do all that to the orphans, even though they kept calling me a soyboy. How do you expect me to know gasoline would help the fire? Adds more eyedrops What I did was inexcusable but I was in a dark place and in my defense, things have been very difficult since my goldfish died. Was it really my fault? I know it was horrific but I didn't think it was a war crime in some countries, but I thought the geneva convention didn't apply to me. (Due to my epic new maverick merch) But don't worry because my #WeForgiveYouMerch special 1000th day anniversary edition merch is still available at LogangMerch.com My lawyer has advised me to say that, I'm sorry I said \"that's a spicy meat-a-ball\" in front of the burning orphans. I didn't mean to and I take full-ish responsibility. Admittedly, it wasn't very kind to sing 'another one bites the dust' at the funeral. But imagine getting offended by that. In my defense, things have been very difficult since my goldfish died. Editor can you please add more tears? I don't think I look sad enough. I was acting like a Scorpio when I should have been compassionate like a Pisces. And while what I did was kinda funny, I hope we can go forward and forget about this. Honestly, I feel awful and so will you if you miss the 10% off sale for my #WeForgiveYouMerch! (link in description!) Lets be real for a second, I will not learn from this plus, I didn't mean to, it just happened and that's okay, we all make mistakes. But, getting to #5 on trending almost made the backlash worth it. Look, I'm sorry, I messed up, I'm apologizing, it was a mistake, I know. But, fuck you I'm not sorry, I'm right and you're wrong. It's called being an influencer. I'm really sorry, that YA'LL ARE SO SENSITIVE! Is the video past 10 minutes? uhhhhh ok, now what else can I apologize for... 10 seconds of very hard thinking later And I'm also sorry for all the children I encouraged my fans to harass online, it also wasn't very poggers. As a peace offering I've posted more feet pics on my level 3 only fans. And I hate to say it but, my WikiFeet rating is still higher than yours. As the great Logangster Paul said, \"I'm really truly sorry that you chose to be offended by my actions.\" But, be sure to buy tickets to my apology tour. And if you want to see my full apology, it's on my paid patreon, please support me on there, UWU. Like I said I made a huge mistake. I don’t expect to be forgiven, I’m just here to apologise. I'm ashamed of myself. I’m disappointed in myself. And I promise to be better. I will be better. Thank you. Sorry sir I will never commit such blasphemy again. I sincerely beg you. I am wrong for letting such foul and vile words out of my mouth when I insulted you. I will do better in the future sire I promise spare me another chance my good sir. This experience really put me in my place and I learned to change from it, I grew deeply in character and I will never do something as grotesque again. I gone through what u call character development and now I can distinguish from right and wrong and my morals are straight. Please I beg for your forgiveness. I swear on my baby momma I will never do you wrong again. I'm just gonna issue an apology for what I did in TWOW 25A's livechat: So TWOW Community and BFDI Community, you may of noticed that during the livechat of TWOW 25A I was complaining about the speech Midnight Light did in the episode. What I did in the chat was complain about how TWOW became \"political\" and that I wanted to escape reality instead of listen to Midnight Light's speech that talked about LGBTQ+ topics. I'll admit that it was pretty homophobic for me to say that LGBTQ+ is political. This of course led to people cancelling me in the HTwins Central and TWOW server, and I know this because someone told me about it. As much I hate cancel culture they were right for this situation. I'm very sorry for what I did in the TWOW 25A livechat, it's just that sometimes the whole \"trans rights\" or \"neopronouns are valid\" movements remind me that there are still issues about pride in this world, and this led me to complaining about Midnight Light bringing these issues into TWOW 25A. I have a feeling the reason why the livechat premiere was disabled was because of me, and if that's the case I'm sorry for that happening too. GUYS GUYS GUYS GUYS! i.. FULLY! understand what I did wrong now after thinking about it….. for like how many hours? like FOUR hours straight and being Hung up about it I know EXACTLY where I went wrong and I know EXACTLY what I did wrong.. so basically umm me saying that “oh fatphobia isn’t real” while not even being educated on it was very stupid of ME I know…..

Meow just wanted to make a quick video to apologise to the fandom.Munches food Meow did not realise the r word was a slur used against mentally challenged people. Meows heard the word many times in meows life and never knew it was a slur. Arigato for educating meow. Gomenasai friends. Meow promises never to say that word again. Meow hopes the disabled fandom feels better soon <3. Eating noise b u r g e r. Arigato! I'm sending this message because I would like to apologize to you for not being able to do this task. I understand this may be frustrating for you, and I have my sincerest apologies for this. I have also understood that this task you ask for is quite literally impossible to do, but as I have to say I still sincerely apologize for this mistake. I hope you will pardon this mistake and will give us another chance. As I tried this task that you have asked me to do, I have realized that this was actually quite impossible for these 2 reasons: I am very lazy and I just don't want to do it. Kindly accept my apologies. Once more I am very sorry for the incident. I decided to take a month off of social media due to the negativity surrounding my platform. It was honestly one of the most difficult times in my life for many reasons. But through struggle, I found clarity within myself and with who I want to surround myself with. My purpose in this life is to create, and whether that's silly TikTok dances or showing unedited photos of myself, creating and inspiring is what fulfills me. I know that this is why God and the universe have given my this platform. I preach self-love, but that takes time and patience. Now, more than ever, I feel proud of the person that I am. Even if I can only inspire one person, I will have done what I was put on this earth to do. We're all learning and growing and, more than anything, I'm beyond thankful for my family, friends, partnerships and supporters. There's a song by Sam Smith that I think a lot of people my age can relate to. I hope this can inspire you. The cock I feel dick is beyond wangs. I'm heartbroken that the schlong of pingas still was not enough to stand up to the disproportionate weiner, rod, and verga of my ex-dong. I'm even more disappointed with what this pecker means for other manhoods. It is a prick. It sets back the cucumber to a longsword when a willie who spoke up and spoke out could be publicly shamed and humiliated. It sets back the wood that shaft against johnson is to be taken seriously. I believe Weenie's tools succeeded in getting the putz to overlook the key phallus of Member of Penis and ignore pito that was so conclusive that prick won in the 69. I'm sad I lost this schlong. But I am sadder still that I seem to have lost a wang I thought I had as an Massive 20 Inch Rod - to speak freely and openly. About the post I did there which got me banned for three days, and then I left the community, is that I was slowly being a dick to the community and the moderators in this subreddit. I am very sorry for my last post (which I now deleted the post after they did because I realized I broke my first rule) and is supposedly just to entertain me a little and then get bored the next few minutes just so I could delete it in an hour before the moderators delete it. For three years I have been in this subreddit and I am also sorry for not posting about my stay here. Ever since War Robots is the backbone of my ideas, and art, and memes, I only thought I was missing something rather than complaining about people asking to buff the weapons then say it is too powerful, thus making the game less fun. After all, I am still with you guys in this subreddit but I might not posting about what is happening on Live Server (I can still post something funny like Titan Schutze or Destrier with all abilities). I still want to have fun in the game and enjoy while it lasts, because that’s what games are for. We are writing to apology for the Improper simple packaging, and thank you for reading this letter. Aiming to reduce your expenditure and environment friendly, we choice this kind of simple to reduce the packaging size. For there is high cross-border shipping costs (charge by size ) and Amazon storage costs (also charge by size ). If we chose the normal standard package ,the total prize will sharply increase 800%.

But please don't worry so much about it ,because the bag all is made by high-quality materials and it will Revert to the original state naturally by itself in 2-3 days.

Please accept our apolise again, I hope that this has not cause any inconvenience I just wanna send out prayers to the.. to the ones that was lost last night, we're actually working right now to identify their families.. so we can help assist them through this tough time. You know my fans, my fans like.. my fans really mean the world to me and..

Um I could just never imagine the severity of this situation uh.. we've been working closely.. uh we've been working closely with everyone to try to get to the bottom of this city houston, hpd, fire department, you know everyone uh.. you know help us.. help us figure this out so if you.. if you have any information um.. you know please just contact your local authorities um.. everybody continue to just keep your prayers, I mean I'm.. I'm honestly just devastated and, I could never imagine anything like this just happening. inhales I'm gonna do everything I can to keep you guys updated and.. just keep you guys.. informed on what's going on um.. exhales love you all. Before I begin my actual comment, I would like to apologize in advance for my inadequate level of English proficiency. I am not a native speaker of the world's current lingua franca which unfortunately leads to me making numerous embarrassing mistakes being made whenever I attempt to communicate using this language. Whenever I am reminded of how I lack the ability to convey my thoughts in an eloquent manner I feel as though I have committed a cardinal sin, as though every English teacher in the world are simultaneously shaking their heads and sighing due to how utterly disappointed they are at me. Although I know that saying sorry to those of you who are reading my comment will not change the fact that I fail miserably to write and speak perfect English, I am writing this as a way to deter a certain type of people who cannot stand poor English (Also known informally as \"Grammar Nazis\") from mocking me by posting unwanted and unnecessary comments detailing my every blunder. In my humble opinion, making grammatical errors should be perfectly acceptable as native speakers should not expect non-native speakers to be able to communicate in their second or third languages eloquently. If you are able to completely understand what the other person wrote, is there really a problem with what they've written? No, because the entire concept of communication is the exchange of information between other intelligent beings, which means that no matter how the exchange of information is made, as long as the information is accurately shared there is not a fundamental issue with their ability to communicate. To see it in another way, remember that someone who isn't fluent in English is fluent in another language. When you think about it this way, isn't it impressive for someone to speak a second language in any capacity? Having empathy and respect are qualities that are sorely missing for far too many people these days, especially on the internet. That being said, I am aware that not all netizens who correct others are doing it to ridicule and shame. There are some who do so with the intent to help others improve and grow. However, displaying the failures of other people publicly will cause the person who is criticized to feel negative emotions such as shame and sadness due to the fact that their mistake has been made obvious which severely undermines the point they were trying to make in spite of their unfamiliarity with the English language. In most circumstances people are not looking for language help when they post anything online. Most people just want to enjoy themselves and have a good time on the internet which is why I would not encourage correcting other people regardless of your intentions. If you really do want to help others with their spelling or grammar, I would highly recommend you to help via messaging privately because not only will you not embarrass anyone, you can also go more in-depth with your explanation which I'm sure the other person will greatly appreciate if they want help, but I digress. I know that I've written a bit of an essay, but I hope I've made my points clear. Anyways, here is the comment I wanted to make: I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean to be racist ok. I’m never racist. That’s not my belief set. Ella Vaday is a queen. The Vivienne is a queen. River Medway is a queen. jujubee is a senior citizen. I’m truly sorry. Please forgive me. Oliver. (An apology in case your so stupid you couldn’t comprehend what I said the first time or you missed it like a person with no brain ) We hated the new cummy until he was gone Maybe it was a reminder that we always hated change but when the change is gone we miss it everyday I am sorry cummybot for i and many other have wronged you, hated you, said mean things about you and now you are forever gone May you rest in peace. Lest it be a glorious day when a new cummybot rises we do not make the same mistakes we have made We are sorry cummybot Lilbroomstick is a retarded little fuck who needs to die already. The fact that she is still on this site goes to show how lazy this system is to ban her from using this site. Lilbroom, you are a little cunt who is needs to kill herself for the greater good of this site and world. You are the devil and and you spread every single negativity throughout this site and world. So please die. my discord server apology lmao When I started these shenanigans, I Wasn't thinking about the consequences, that would later occur. I never meant for such damage, and disturbance to occur. I was an active member, who was online most days, and only simply commit such things, for a \"joke\". But now, I realise, such acts of exploiting a bot, to disturb chat, was a terrible idea. I am very sorry for my uncivilized manner, and i understand, that you good fellows, at the server moderation team, must be very angry by my actions, But i would like to apologize for the damage caused, even though, this will most likely change nothing.

    "title": "TAKE HOME ESSAY #1 ON EDUCATION",
    "self_text": "Why an Effective education must include the education of the mind and heart to equal extents While a traditional education is not necessarily bad for students, an effective education must include equal education of the mind and heart. Well-rounded students are important in building functional members of society, and focusing one’s whole life on school is bad for mental health. It prevents students from becoming one-sided robots, and is essential for proper schooling. While students who focus entirely on education and a career path in school, those with educated minds and hearts push humans forward as a species. The creation of well-rounded students is a common issue in today’s society, but it has been a topic of conversation since Aristotle’s time. Think about times in history where humans made the most progress. One time that stands out is ancient Greece, where becoming a learned citizen was an admired trait. They invented things like democracy, which is a system we use today. Socrates is so smart, he invented the Socratic method, which is a method of answering questions that always leads you to the right answer, so his opinion is definitely credible. I agree with Socrates that the mind and heart must be equally educated. My heart and mind are equally educated and I look down upon my peers that have uneducated hearts and so would Socrates if he was alive (Socrates died in 322 BCE). In order for society to push itself forward and for kids like me to reach the beautiful American Dream, our minds and hearts must be educated to equal extents.",

    "title": "Why \"Yeah\" is the best Queen song",
    "self_text": "&#x200B;  This song is clearly on the same level as Bohemian Rhapsody and March of the Black Queen. The best part of it is the instrumentation, or lack thereof. You see, simple is beautiful here. Silence is golden.  Sure, Brian May is a genius guitarist, John Deacon is an amazing bassist, and Roger Taylor can be both of those, but there is just so much to appreciate in this one Freddie only track.  First, the single word starts out as an airy \"yh\" sound. He really knew what he was doing here, for he fools us all for a second. We would think for a minute that he's going to say something else, but NO, we are fooled again. He does eventually utter another partial syllable to complete the word. This time around, he completely gives it his all. There's power behind that one little word, for he then clearly intonates an \"e\" sound. Once again, Freddie, you dastardly fox, you change it up on us. We see him transition from E into an A vowel. There is so much EMOTION in this single word. You can hear the pain of twenty years of trying to find love and fialing, as well as his struggle with AIDS. It's all here. This song is classic Queen through and through.  It is clear that he put thought into bringing forth this single word. From the sneaky vowel change to the contrast in how it is spoken, \"Yeah\" is truly a masterpiece to behold. This may well be the best song ever made. Not even the genius minds of Beethoven and Mozart can even compare. This is music's peak right here.  Wait, there's more. As previously mentioned, there is no instrumentation at all. You see, even such a simple syllable can be beautiful, as I have claimed. You see, there is a deeper meaning behind that simplicity. During that rollercoaster of a word's utterance, you can hear something deeper behind it: That something is a concealed pain. You see, there's something that this song is actually about that the band just won't tell you.  This song is, in reality, a glorious cry of emotional pain. Think about it: Freddie Mercury suffers from AIDS and is literally in the process of dying as he records his last songs, like this one. He has come to terms with mortality, and it  scares  him. He is  afraid.  He realizes that alas, he is no longer a God among men. He returns to the status of a normal man, and  he is hurting.   And all he can say is  \"Yeah. \" Yeah, he's hurting. Yeah, he's slowly dying. Yeah, he shall leave us soon. But will he go down without a fight? Hell no.  What a beautiful statement of defiance this song truly is. I say to you, this deeper meaning is \"Yeah, I am Freddie Mercury, and I accept my fate! Yeah, come and try to take me!\"  I hope you can learn something from my detailed analysis. This syllable of a song is a force to be reckoned with.",

    "self_text": "Honestly: There is no single standard convention for axes. And while some subject domains do have a convention—GPS coordinates use z-up, for instance, which makes sense in that context—games are a total free-for-all, no holds barred. Pretty much the only thing that almost no one ever does is set the x-axis to be up or down. (Source: I work around game development and swapping around axes as you switch from tool to tool is standard. Along with all the fun that happens switching between right-hand and left-hand coordinate systems! Literally the two biggest engines available to the common developer, Unity and Unreal, have been y-up and z-up respectively.) It's not mysterious how it happened. Putting it as X and Y as sideways and vertical with Z as depth make sense with screen coordinates which makes sense when something is effectively 2d but has some manner of depth (and that's how our graphics cards generally ultimately work with things for the same reason, once all the math lining everything up for the screen is done)—oh, and in that case y can be either up or down (down makes antiquated/niche sense; '0' as the 'first line of the image data'). Conversely, putting everything as X and Y as grid coordinates for the flat \"ground\" and Z as height make sense for a heck of a lot of 3d games, like those where a character is wandering around a big world (approximately for the same reasons it makes sense for GPS). And then again at the end of the day, obviously, whether it makes \"sense\" or not for your game only matters infinitesimally because you can just use the other damn letters if that happens to be what you have to work with, so, no big deal either way, right? And so everyone went off in different directions decades ago and there's no real pressure to converge (just write scripts to flip axes when converting material from one piece of software to another; it's not complicated unless you have to do it in real-time and even that's pretty straightforward most of the time). So yeah. If they say Z is up in a game, it's just as legit as anything else, alas.",

Nobody is making you play. Fuck off. Go away. Toodles. Bye bye. Or play idc but stop whining every time you die and get better. So my question is; will there actually be any gameplay, tips, comedy or anything that isn’t whining 24/7?  Edit: Jesus fucking Christ the amount of people saying “ you’re whining about whining. Isn’t that ironic?” I’ll address this here since you stupid fucks can’t read. It was a question. Trying to see if that’s all this sub did. If you think I’m whining fine. If it’s ironic then cool. The fact that so many of you comment all the same shit speaks volumes about your ability to think for yourselves. Although that would require thinking and I’m pretty sure that’s a little advanced for you idiots. Also to clarify yes the game should be finished. Those complaints are valid.

So in the intro and my friends come riding skateboards and a beautiful girl I know says ''Wow, he's cool'' then the song starts and everyone is already impressed by my deep voice and lyrics. When the beat drops everyone is terrified by the lyrics, and my performance on stage, with a green mask looking directly at the audience and spitting destruction.  My teachers are also very impressed thinking ''This kid is different, I understand what he's doing'' and they are also shocked when I say ''Fuck school'' and encourage students to screw up. And when Tyler says ''Fuck a mask I want that hoe know it's me'' I take off my mask and all the girls are impressed by my handsomeness, and one downstairs who is mysterious and pretty thinks my style is cool and thinks me different.  I do it with a lot of other songs too, like French, Seven, Who Dat Boy, Yonkers, Bastard, Goblin, all songs with shocking lyrics or when the beat drops everyone feels like jumping.

    "title": "The Hog Rider",
    "self_text": "The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy. Strategy His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand. The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells. A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more. The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball. However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter. Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible. It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value. In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation. Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage. When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings. Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building. Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox. If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique. For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed. For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa. They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower. The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push. A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower. This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower. The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it. A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower. Pairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage. If executed properly, the Hog Rider will act as a tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage. The Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the combo. However, this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air cards as neither of the troops target anything but buildings. Additionally, they are easy to separate, due to the disparity in move speeds. Alternatively, the Hog Rider and the Balloon can be played in different lanes to spread the opponent's defenses thin. However, a building or Tornado can bring them back together for an easier defense. The Hog Rider can be paired with the Lumberjack as both a swarm bait and damage combo. It is a very fast combo with an extremely high damage output potential, so the enemy will likely try to counter it with a swarm. If this happens, use a spell like Arrows to render the opponent defenseless. If they manage to defeat the Lumberjack, the dropped Rage will make the Hog Rider even more dangerous than it normally is. A fast and deadly combination is the Hog Rider and Mini P.E.K.K.A. combo. Both units are fast but the Mini P.E.K.K.A. does much more damage and does not attack only buildings so the Mini P.E.K.K.A. can deal with troops like the Executioner and Musketeer. However, this combo can be defeated with swarms like Skeleton Army, which will defeat both of them since neither of them can deal area damage. They are also unable to target air troops, so the Minion Horde can stop this easily. A risky play is to deploy the Hog Rider at the bridge as soon as the match starts. If the opponent does not react fast enough, the Hog Rider will deal a significant amount of damage to the Princess Tower. This can also allow the player to quickly scout the opponent's deck if they happen to react to him fast enough.",

I hadn't been constipated, hadn't eaten any different than I normally do. Yet somewhere around the 7 minute mark of thinking I'd finished just to plop down again for more I realized that I was on my way to meet the angels.   I dont even know how long it had lasted, but I believe I'd thoroughly emptied out everything below the esophagus. Wasn't diarrhea, but the indidual turds at the bottom had been squished under the weight of the pile, and spread through to the edges of the bowl. The water line was merely a mile marker, and the center of this pile must have been a full 1.5-2\" out of the water. My toes were tingling, and my stomach felt cold and empty, yet I felt so clean in a way I never thought possible.   I was briefly horrified when I flushed thinking it might actually back up, but somehow there was clear passage. Every 10 minutes or so I had to return for another flush (takes the tank awhile to fill back up). I still feel like I can soar on the back of an angel everytime I lookback on this shit",

As I am packing I forgot where I put the wire for my charger and where I left it, as I make this realization my parents scream at me to hurry up, I tell them no and kept searching at this hotel we were staying at. I search, and search, and search walking around the place till somehow, for some fuckin reason, the phone In my pocket suddenly MAGNETICALLY gets attached to some guy's dangling phone wire charger. I was about to say sorry but when I looked up to his face HE HAD BEEN CARRYING A BUNCH OF CHARGER CABLES THAT LOOK AWFULLY SIMILAR TO MINE. While I'm looking at the guy his eyes widen and start running away from me, my parents tell me to hurry the fuck up or the bus is gonna leave, So I do. I start chasing the guy around the hotel while doing parkour till we reach a really long staircase downwards, as he starts running down it I sit myself onto the comically long and zigzagging rails and slide down the stairs to get to him, BUT BEFORE I DO THAT I SEE WHERE I SHOULD HOP OFF THE RAILS, it looks weirdly calculated in my dream, anyways my mind goes  \"huh I wouldn't be able to land this in real life but good thing I'm dreaming\" And fucking LAND IT WITH SO MUCH MOMENTUM THAT I STICK THE LANDING AND THE WORLD STOPPED AS I REALIZED \"wait did I just say I'm dreaming?\" As everything came into full clarity I looked up from where I landed.  The bustling hotel cafeteria is right there, but no people in sight. I didn't think anything of it as I was still recovering from my landing. I couldn't see where the guy went so in a moment of lucid dream cheats... I fuckin turned on x ray and saw him highlighted red and ran towards him and tackled him.  And then I woke up to my phone falling out of my hand",

I do not object to the pornography with consenting adults and I don't care if he looks at it. But we’ve been together for a year.

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of film history most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Denji's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Camus literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about DEVILS. As a consequence people who dislike Chainsaw Man truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Denji's existential catchphrase \"VAM VAAVAAA,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Pope's English burlesque The Rape of the Lock. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Tatsuki Fujimoto's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂 And yes, by the way, i DO have a Pochita tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you're an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole. The magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did. When Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality. After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society. No wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member. Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted sac religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. Rhodes Island would have been better off if you'd never joined us. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this worlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small part of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It's hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would have to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did. The countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant. Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague apparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind's greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently as possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an irresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who's soul contains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel when thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have to do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I think that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own feelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe. My hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless. There is no one in this world that has ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, no one will ever love you in the future either. There is no hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will ever change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the mistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will only devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible way in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is would exclusively be because there is absolutely no conceivable way that you would even be able to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in.",

    "self_text": "The michelin star system is and will likely remain the best system to  clarify what food is objectively good and what is bad. Gault millau too.  I assume by your formed opinion you haven’t gone to their website and  read their very clearly defined criteria. Yes, the standards seem to  have fallen and one stats are being dished out a lot more often now, but  no it isnt. Hospitality is about making people feel welcome,  comfortable, happy - providing an experience to them. Where do most  people meet their lifelong partners? Hospitality. Where do most people  celebrate their birthdays on occasion? Hospitality. Social interactions  are so easily facilitated and exacerbated by the hospitality industry,  and most profit seeking business just try and tick boxes. michelin  chefs, typically above 2 stars, try to put themselves and their lives  out there so people can experience some of them too, while also catering  to the bare necessities of high standard dining. there is a soul there.  love, not profit margins. People in kitchens are authentic, typically  because they’ve suffered a lot in life but found love behind the stove.  Some chefs cook for stars, others cook to serve. Food, drink, and  sometimes a message. The latter typically achieve them, but the former  are able to as well. you can distinguish them. There is so much variety  it is a massively creative environment. all restaurants differ from each  other greatly and so do the chefs. Take alex atala, for example. Brazil  has always been seen by the international world as a shithole in the  gastronomic sense, yet what is he currently achieving? He is showing the  beautiful variety of produce grown there, from beans to cassava to  fruits to insects, he is getting this ‘humble produce’, refining it and  serving it to international aristocrats, blowing their minds. He is  showing that Brazil is much more than what it seems to be, especially  considering people forget its land mass is nearly equivalent to all of  Europe’s. Not only that but he is also able to pass on ideas of  sustainability, consideration to natives, and humility to a massive  audience - all while out of the kitchen!   and the thing is with a plate of food - when its truly good - it is  something else, indescribable really. the myriad of flavours available,  the infinite combinations- the truly good ones. most people have  experienced a fraction of all flavours - you ever tried a good dashi? a  smoked butter based citrus sauce? finger lime? meat radish ? fresh  truffle ? guarana ? lemon verbena? it goes on and on and on and its all  new flavours. thats the thing with smell and taste, there are thousands  upon thousands of highly designed receptors there. your other senses are  pretty straight forwards - sight, hearing, touch - sharp or soft?  you’re not living if youre not tasting. trust me. weve been cooking  since we put fish on sticks over a fire, its our true nature. sharing  meals at the table is where a family is really formed.",
