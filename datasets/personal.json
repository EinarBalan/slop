    "title": "Should I file a report (a person kicking my car as I drove by)?",
    "self_text": "I was driving on a residential street near where I live, at night. The park area next to it is the site of the highest concentration of homeless encampments in town, and there are frequently people acting strange in the area, drunk or strung out or just struggling with untreated mental illness. Anyway, there was a guy walking slowly in the middle of the oncoming lane. Long hair and a beard, I assumed he was one of the local homeless.   He wasn't crossing, just walking down the street in the middle of the oncoming lane. I remember thinking that he should be careful, as people coming the other way might not see him. As I drove past, he lunged towards my car and kicked the rear door as it went by.  I was shocked.  I looked in my rear view and he was continuing down the street like nothing had happened. I was afraid to stop and get into an altercation, so I kept going. I'm quite confident that I didn't hit him, as he kicked the rear door panel, and didn't hit my rear-view mirror. I saw him from a ways off, and he clearly lunged towards me as I approached.   Obviously, I'm pissed that he put a big dent in my door, and I'd like to report it, but two things are stopping me:   First,  I'm afraid the police might assume I was spinning the story. He  did  make contact with my car while it was moving, and I didn't stop. Could this constitute a hit-and-run?   Second, I have fuck-all for a description. Again, this area is like ground zero for disturbed street people. The cops likely wouldn't care even if I had a description, which I don't. But on the other hand, on the extremely small chance that the guy decided to report it, would it look bad if I didn't file a report?  Edit: I'm definitely buying a dash cam after this. Some friends have suggested that this might be an aborted fraud attempt, and I'm thinking they may be right.",

I was also a “weird kid” so I’ve always had maybe 1-2 friends at a time. Not to mention many of my friends have stabbed me in the back so I’m a little closed off.

    "title": "Our entire building is bed bug infested, the management knew about it for months, but did nothing about it. My roommates and I want to take them to housing court, but are broke and have no idea where to start. Any Advice?",
    "self_text": "I made a post about the bed bug situation in more detail in another sub, so if you're looking for more details please refer to that post. Below is a summary of what we're dealing with:  Edit: we live in BROOKLYN, NYC.   My 2 roommates and I recently discovered that we had a bedbug infestation in our New York City apt. It has been beyond hell and beyond anything we could have imagined.  To top it all off, our apt neighbor told us that she has seen a bunch of other tenants throwing out bug bed infested furniture. She told us that she reached out to management at the beginning of September to warn them about a infestation in the building. She sent pictures of infested furniture that was moved outside our apt building and complained that she'd seen a dead bed bug in her apt. She started living out of bags as a precaution because she saw the bed bug in her apt. The exterminator refused to treat her apt because he says that he has to see a bed bug to do anything.  The entire building is infested  and the management won’t do anything about it. They won’t treat your apt unless they see a bed bug, they gaslight you and belittle your struggle and take months to fix the problem. Someone had to come at-least 8 times to fix our mouse problems (it is still not resolved we saw another mouse a 2 days ago) because no one cares nor have they ever tried to do a thorough job. The only reason why they have treated our apt is because we have threatened to call 311 a number of times and actually have a few times.   We regrettable signed papers after every treatment they have given us, but we will not sign anything any longer.   This is the same building that had been leaving and dumping hundreds of garbage bags worth of trash in the court yard (which they cleaned up after we called 311). People are stealing packages and there are so many issues in the apt.  After an overwhelming amount of people suggested we go to housing court( not only on our previous post, but from 311 directly, my therapist, and other friends ) we've decided to pursue legal action if possible.   We have no idea how to go about this nor do we know what resources are afforded to us. Last night we put notes on every doorstep of the tenants in the building informing them that we were pursing legal action. We provided an email and phone number that they could call to send us picture and video evidence of an the  infestation in the apt and negligence. We also advised them to call 311 and make a compliant.   We are fighting for actual maintenance of the building, care for the residents, An actually caring thorough and good exterminator for the entire building, and financial compensation for the damaged property due to the bed bugs, mice and roaches, the time it has taken to treat this infestation and the cost of washing and drying all of our clothes, our security deposit back, and any other financial compensation that we can get.  I called 311 again and made 6 complaints today 3 for our apt and 3 for the building. I am really nervous about what they are going to do next. They have been neglecting us for over a year now and we are tired of it.   We are fighting for not only ourselves, but for the people in the building who have lived under this abusive management for years. Enough is enough. Any advice or direction to resources would be very helpful thank you so much for your support!  TLDR: Our building is infested with bed bugs, management knew about it for months and did nothing and now it has spread to our apt. We are seeking to pursue legal action and take them to housing court.",

    "self_text": "So my boyfriend (26m) went on his first work trip. I (26f) was happy for him to get to do this and trusted him to be responsible and respectful while away.   He was distant on this trip and I told myself it was because he was busy working and learning so I didn’t message too much and just waited for his updates.   During this time I was home and got the sniffles and was a little under the weather. The last night of the trip, was the worst with communication. He told me that he and his boss were going to a bar and I told him to be safe and have fun but careful fun with his boss as at the end of the day he is still his boss.   That was at 11pm. I didn’t hear anything else and it turned to 1am and I just sent a text making sure he was okay before I headed to bed. He said that they were still at the bar and that he was leaving soon. Cool.   Fast forward to a week later, he’s on a work call in front of me and his boss starts talking about the fun they had at a strip club. This was news to me and he immediately took the phone off of speaker and turned the volume down.   I immediately knew the night he said they were at a bar was the night that they were actually at a strip club and he refrained from telling me. He claims his boss dragged him there and they stayed for hours despite him knowing that this is something I would not totally be okay with which is why he kept it from me.   I’ve been feeling like this was a breach of trust. Maybe I am overthinking but I feel unable to trust him after that. It would’ve been different if he just told me himself… but the fact that he was trying so hard to keep it a secret and I found out the way that I did is what really is throwing me off.",

    "self_text": "Hey y'all, as a chronic over thinker ( something that  I've been trying to curb when it comes to dating) I just wanted to share my story and maybe it can help me and some other people out.  Just a back story on my history, I've had a interesting experience with OLD.  I'm 28(m)  have been on Hinge on and off for the better part of 4 years, which has led to one of my longest LTR of my whole life (just over 2 1/2 years) Overall not a terrible experience but not the greatest either.  I met a someone on Hinge about 2 months ago and things went well from the start, gave her my number on the app and we set up a great first date. She was immediately attracted to me and I found her to be very attractive, our chemistry was insane (first 5 dates we were complimented everytime by a stranger on how well we looked together and our energy towards one another). We set up a few more dates and I was really starting to like this girl with some healthy hesitation to guard the ol Blood pumper (heart).  I wanted to figure out her dating goals early on because I feel it sets the best precedent early on for communication and for what  both party's are looking for. On the 3rd date I asked what she was looking for and her \"dating intentions\"  She said she  was looking for something  long term and has not had many dates on hinge, just uses it to see what's out there but overall she hadn't had the best experience with OLD.  We  both seemed to be in the same spot both out of our  2 year LTR relationship's ended about 4 months prior. And the topic of exes was short clear and concise. Mine ended way before it actually ended and she expressed the same to me.  Two months go by we are seeing each other 1-3 times a week holding hands, cuddling and getting horizontal (lol). She met my closest  friends, she thought they were amazing and vice versa. Overall things were going great and moving in the right direction.  Last week I get invited by her to a double date with one of her best friends(latter told I passed the friend test they really liked me), it was a great time. When we get back to my place I  ask how she feels about what we have going on, immediately I feel the whole vibe shift. She tells me she is super into me and likes me so much but is fucked up from her past relationship and makes her question her judgment about herself and potential relationships. She asked are you over your ex? I responded \"I am Absolutely over my Ex  but I totally get the hesitation I'm down to just keep doing what we are doing and see what happens\".  We had plans set up for today (11/18/2022) with her same friend group I met the other night and overall really looking forward to it.  We go 2 days  no texting which isn't out of the normal. I'm not huge on texting all the time and neither is she. I texted her to see if she wanted to grab dinner before Friday the 18th, she responded \"yes!\" and \"I'm so excited\".  About 1 hour later I get the dreaded \"It's not you, It's me, I really need to figure my shit out before I start dating\"....absolutely shook me and caught me so off guard.  I responded with something along the lines of  \"Can I please have my belongings back at some point,  I really enjoyed our time together Thank you for being honest and  I totally get it you have to look out for what's best for you, good luck and take care\". Its been 2 days and no response and I'm counting my belongings as a loss.  For some reason this hit me harder than some of my past \"flings\" maybe because of how much we had in common and we just meshed. I came to realize  I'm sad about the \"what could have been\" rather than reality.  In reality some people think they are ready to date fresh out of a relationship until they find someone who is datable and the shit becomes real...real fast. I had so much anxiety leading up to me asking how she thought things were going, I just had a strange feeling she might not be over her ex. And was calling my friends the next day telling them I might have fucked this up. Thank god I didn't wait until 6 months down the line just to be hurt more  I'm going to keep dating and live my life, maybe in a couple months I'll make a bad decision and see what's she's up to and get let down again lmao",

    "self_text": "I always thought I was a good friend. Our friend group was always close, we fooled around a lot, been through band camp, AP classes, and drama together. I’ve known some of them since elementary school. I remembered all of their birthdays and got them presents that I knew they would like. I barely spend any money on myself, most of what I spend is on them. There was no drama between us. We were all chill, laughing, the type of group that everyone thinks is kinda weird but we don’t really mind. On everyone’s birthday we tell them happy birthday over on discord on midnight, and tease them about it the next day at school. We give presents, buy them snacks, we have a fun time. Sometimes they have a party and we chill at their place, playing games and eating food. But on my birthday, nothing like that happened. They shared a happy birthday over on discord, and the next day at school was chill, but there was a distinct lack of presents. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not a greedy guy. I know that birthdays are more about the spirit and the atmosphere, but I don’t know. Maybe a small part of me hoped that they would repay me what I have given them. The entire day, exactly one person told me that they couldn’t afford to get me anything, and there as not so much as a birthday card given to me. I know this is a petty thing to be upset over, but I always thought that I was a big part in their lives. That I was worth at least a card with time and effort put into it. I tried holding on hope. Maybe they forgot their presents at home? But after a few days, that turned out to not be the case. I don’t show them I’m upset about it, and they haven’t mentioned it at all. I think I need to let this out off my chest. Maybe a small part of me is hoping that one of them sees this and talks to me about it. I don’t know. I know this is a small thing to get fussed about but it meant a lot to me. Sorry, I needed to share this. Advice is appreciated.",

    "self_text": "So, a little backround. One of my (29F) best friends (30F, let’s call her Jane) has been in a relationship for the past 10 (?) months with Jack (40sM). Jane has been through a lot in the past years, between health, family and love problems she has had quite some issues and it has been very difficult to deal with it all. For her and everyone around her.   It is also important to know that Jane has always wanted to be in relationship, and often times does everything in her power (even bending, subjugating herself and trying too hard) to make things work. Things always ended with her heartbroken.   So after finally ending a very toxic in the begining of the year, she met and quickly fell in love with Jack and their relationship became quite serious way too soon. Nonetheless, we were all very happy for her.   Recently our group of friends has started to notice red flags. For exemple, he walk by us in a neighbour city with female company and would pretend to not see us. He also refuses to post pictures online (or even be tagged) with Jane.  Our suspcions have started to confirm themselves when a friend of Jane’s (who works in the same place as Jack) started hearing rumours and conversations about Jack with other women.  Well, Jane’s friend had told us she would spill the beans but wanted to catch Jack “in the act”, but now has said she won’t say a word because she says Jane can get suicidal or even have a regression in her disease, but also because she doesn’t want to deal with the drama.   Me and my friends feel like it is time for us to step up and talk to Jane to let her know what is happening but we don’t really know how to approach her. For many times I have relied on Reddit’s helpful insights and I am hoping to do so one more time.   Should we tell her what is going on? How should we do so?  Edit: clarity.",

I was was worried at first about the medications he’s already on but the doctor said it was okay. I said I felt it helped me so I’m happy he got it too. So after a bit more talking about it I said that there is a small chance of a rebound case. He got really quiet and got off the phone with me pretty quick. He then sent me a text saying: “Any other negative thing you want to share about Covid while my dad is recovering?”  I wasn’t trying to be negative. It then degraded into a whole mess of texts about how he’s having doubts and doesn’t want to be with someone who has a negative outlook.   He compared my comment to saying to someone with cancer it Might come back.   I really thought we were having a conversation and I was just sharing information.",

    "title": "AITA for confronting neighbourhood ding-dong-dashers?",
    "self_text": "Just to be clear if \"ding-dong-dash\" is country specific, I am talking about when children ring doorbells and run away.  I (F29) am a SAHM with a sick toddler and a newborn at the moment. My husband (M31) took some time off work when the baby was born, but has since gone back, so it is just the babies in the house day-to-day. Safe to say, I am not particularly well-rested at the moment, and the house is a bit chaotic.  Today being Saturday, my husband said that he would help me catch up on some of the chores while I got some rest. I was really grateful, it has been a tough week. Unfortunately, some kids in the neighbourhood must have taken advantage of the good weather and thought to play ding-dong-dash.  The first incident was funny, the second time was mildly irritating, but I was downright frustrated by the sixth time. The baby and the toddler were both woken/disturbed each time, and I didn't get any of the rest that I was so looking forward to. I decided that I would help my husband with chores seeing as I was up anyway.  The seventh ding-dong-dash just so happened to be when I was vaccumming the hallway, so I got to the door before the kids were gone. There were two young boys, I would say six or seven, and they got a massive shock when I opened the door.  To be clear, I was firm but I was by no means shouting or hostile. I asked them what they thought was funny about disturbing my family, and one of them responded that I was not their mom. I said back, \"I am not, but I don't think she would want to be disturbed either.\" After that, they turned and ran away. It was a very brief interaction.  Later, a man identifying himself as the boys' dad knocked on the door and said I made the boys cry. He said that it was children being children, they weren't hurting anyone, and my comment about their mom being disturbed was uncalled for seeing as she had passed away. He said that I made them both cry all afternoon and they are afraid of playing in the neighbourhood anymore. He also said that he could not believe I \"lay in wait for them.\"  I explained that I was sick and tired of the doorbell going off, but he said that I should just disarm it if some ringing disturbs my family that much. I feel like I am entitled to a doorbell, but that I shouldn't have to deal with constant ringing.",

Since then I have not mentioned it at all. But I do know that my father is in fact homophobic because like months before this he he came into my room and asked \"hey are you gay\"and I did not want to come out then so I was just like  \"maybe\" And then he basically just told me\"no you can't be gay'English is not my parents first language so they were talking in like like their first language but directly translated that was basically what it was. and then he just got(pressured) me to nod and and then he left it was a very uncomfortable interaction   I don't know about the rest of my family but I'd assume they're homophobic as well. I remember the small reaction when we went to a friend's house and in the movie I'm not sure if the character was gay but he was at least acting gay and my mother just looks so disgusted   it just made me so scared to come out but yeah and my grandparents are like old and the ones that taught my father to think like that soo  They might think I was joking cuz they don't know what s*** about me my parents barely  remember or acknowledge my birthday",

When we spoke that time, he confessed that sometimes he wishes that it was me who’s with him blah blah but he also told me that I am the best and worst for him. And I actually agree to the latter. Right now, he is still the love of my life maybe because he’s the only person I’ve loved (family excluded ofc). I’m really just venting right now to help me unload all these feelings I have.

Well she noticed recently that when I am driving us everywhere(I use that word intentionally) that she feels better when I always have 2 hands on the wheel. I am not opposed to driving with both hands on the wheel but also my first car ever was an '89 Jeep Wrangler manual and I drove a manual all throughout college so I admit it's gonna take some behavior modification to fix. I drove us back from the lake this weekend 2 1/2 hours and I did try but old habits die hard and my wife was back seat driving the entire way home. I mean literally anytime I took my hands off from taking a drink or itching something it was \"two hands on the wheel\" 😑 So tonight I am driving us home from an awesome date night and 5 mins from home I'm making a turn when she harshly says two hands on the wheel. I said I was turning and started to get frustrated when she basically blamed me for feeling sick when I drive her. I say fine simple solution, we can drive separately or you can drive me. Problem Solved. Absolutely Not because she hates driving herself.  A huge argument that I feel is ridiculous. I don't mind driving all the time but who likes a back seat driver. And her solution is asking me how I would like to receive the criticism. I said I don't really think it's up to me to figure that out but if she must say something, be gentle, be cautious of your tone and what you say??? But in her head the way she is doing it is the only way to fix \"my problem\". I said well you can't figure out a way to address my driving in a way that doesn't make me feel attacked, then I can't drive you. And now just tears and it's somehow my fault. AITA?",

I (F32) work in healthcare and have to commute 15+hrs a week. My husband has also been having health issues over the past 18 months which have been very difficult, physically and emotionally for us to deal with.  We’ve been having arguments about family visits- my brother would like me to go over every week or every other week which is difficult for us to do that regularly. I’ve asked if we could have it so that we drive over once a month and they drive down once a month but my brother says it’s too difficult with the kids to be in the car.   He has said some mean things to me when I’ve been unable to go for several weeks in the past (we had a 6 week streak of covid and other issues getting in the way) and he basically stated he was telling his kids they don’t have an aunt because I don’t care to see them.  For months we had agreed I was hosting Christmas this year. In my culture we celebrate on Christmas Eve. He asked that we have Christmas at his house because of the drive. I’ve taken time off work before the 24th to be able to prep the turkey and get things ready, I’ve decorated quite a bit because last Christmas was shitty with what my husband was going through and the ones before were covid, so I was pumped to have a great time this year. I should also mention that I have space for them to sleep over if they prefer. He said that when I have kids, we’ll spend Christmas at my house and that since his kids would be older they’ll visit more frequently. But I know that my brother can be lazy and will come up with something then (as teens, he would make me go buy him McDonald’s in winter while he stayed in the house for example).  So WIBTA if I tell my brother off and insist we have Christmas at my house? I don’t have kids atm, so I’m sure I don’t grasp how difficult the drive can be.",

I wasn’t originally invited which was fine with me as they’re going to party and gamble which isn’t my thing but now they want me to come because they think I’d make a great surprise present for him.  The way it was sold to me was that I would be alone for a few days before they revealed the surprise and that I couldn’t tell my boyfriend or anybody else I would be there. I said no because it honestly makes me feel gross that they want me to go only to sleep with him and to pretend I’m not there for the rest of the time.  They’ve offered to change the plan around if I’d agree to go and his best friend has been guilting me by saying my boyfriend would want to see me on his birthday so I should do it for him. Another friend has also made unfunny jokes about how they would have to find a replacement gift if I didn’t go.  AITA for refusing to go?",

    "self_text": "So my BF does this thing where he needs to disagree with me on the most mundane conversations. Sometime he’ll even use negative stance to agree with me.   He is not the most educated, nor the most political, or cultivated person. But sometime he talks like he studied psychology for 15 years and it makes me loose my mind. I have a very impulsive personality, and I can get angry real fast (working on it with a therapist). I don’t like when he talks like he know something, when I obviously know he doesn’t l, or at least doesn’t know more than me. It just pisses me off.   I don’t even know how to describe clearly his behaviour since it is so subtle sometimes. The thing is I repressed thoughts or conversation I’d have with him, just because I expect how he would answer me, and I know it will get me in a bad mood.   I feel like he always make conversations so argumentative and he pins that on me, since I fought back to what he said. And sometime I loose my shit and get angry and start having a rougher tone and words   When I bring that behaviour to him, he said he didn’t contradict me at all, that it is all in my head and that I have been mean to him. To be honest, it is true, sometimes I’ll use words I shouldn’t, and I often sincerely apologize for it. But when I talk to him about what he does it’s like he doesn’t realize, and makes me second thought my feelings. Did he really got argumentative or is it just me interpreting it this way?  I don’t know what I came to find saying all that here. Mostly I’m feeling alone and I don’t know for sure I’m not imagining all this. I feel like I’m the only one that could do better in our relationship. If I’m honest I think i’d like to hear that I’m right to loose my shit when confronted to this behaviour constantly, but if you think otherwise feel free to say it. I sincerely want to do better, but don’t know how.   TLDR; my BF always disagree with me and it makes me loose my shit because I feel cornered in the most mundane conversation we have.

    "self_text": "When my husband and I got married we merged finances, so that his paycheck gets deposited into our joint account and about 60% of mine goes into the same account. The other 40% of mine goes into an account that pays the mortgage and is used to make our monthly contributions to our brokerage account.  The reason we have it set up that way is I bought my apartment right when we started dating, and so I pay for it all with my earnings out of an account where I get a discount on the mortgage rate, and that’s why part of my paycheck is directly deposited into it.  When we got married my husband didn’t want to transition to joint credit cards, so we each have our own cards, and his is paid from his checking account and mine are paid from the joint account. All of our bills are paid from the joint account or via my credit cards, which are paid from the joint account. Since all of our bills (car, apartment maintenance, garage, utilities, cleaning person, etc.) and pretty much all of our joint meals, groceries, travel, discretionary spending, etc. are all paid from the joint account or on my credit cards, what I’ve been doing is transferring a set amount to his checking account every month, which was an amount he said would be enough for his expenses.  I just checked his checking account though, and his credit card bills are more than the amount of the allowance I deposit every month. I asked him if he needs more, and he told me that he needs double what he is currently getting. He has access to our joint account and can use it for any spending or to take cash out at any time. I think if he wants to double the amount of spending money he’s getting it would be nice to know what he is spending it on.   AITA for wanting to know how much he is spending and on what? (I doubled the monthly transfer amount already, so it’s more a matter of curiosity, not a condition of him getting more).",

Her guy friend makes me uncomfortable.So basically, after a series lf events where she told me abt him, i think she started realising that her talking abt him really bothers me, so she started hiding her life with him from me. Last week, when i sent texts to her mid college, to “how are you” from my end i got a reply “very bad”. She later explained thst it was this guy who had texted, from the quick respond feature while he had the phone as she was showing him an app she made. Idk i felt like someone stabbed me in my chest, cuz my sense of privacy and intimacy with my gf just vanished. I told her to let me be for a while and told her ant how this made me feel. Later on call, i explained how this made me feel and she kindly asked me how i wanted her to comfort me and started workin on it immediately, for which im grateful and feel a lil gulity. Later, on a note of being honest with each other, she revealed more abt her relationship with this friend, that they listen to music together on the bus, that they sit very close to each other and that once he didn’t apologise for touching her as an apparent accident, which made her uncomfortable(it has happened before). I felt terrible, the first two made me feel devalued, the amt of intimacy they had, i didnt only feel like ill lose her as my gf but also as my best friend. The last one, i was plain mad (at him), that it just shouldn’t have happened and i told her that. She stayed with me trying to comfort me through all this, but ive been umable to get around this. Whenever she mentions him my mood immediately drops, and she knows it, and ive made it difficult for her to be around this guy, cuz she is reminded of how i feel abt it. I feel like im not enough? That i cant be there for her as much as he can, even tho i am. I feel like at some point he’ll have more value to her than me and well ig im really insecure about that. Ig sometimes i see myself in him, a friend turned boyfriend. The terrible consequence of my feelings has been this friend somehow catching how i feel about him, and it’s strained their friendship. I domt want to be that asshole either, and ik that this strain really bothers her. TLDR: how do i get over being insecure abt my gfs guy friend, infact all her guy friends cuz she mostly has guy friends.",

    "self_text": "Backstory When I (18m) was 5, my dad (53) met my step mum (56). They started dating and eventually she got pregnant with my half sister (11). However, things started to go sour and they ended up divorcing and to be honest, I was glad. She basically forced us all to move in a smaller house because she originally didn’t like the house we were living in since my Half sister didn’t have her own room. However every house my dad and her viewed she either didn’t like or it was “too expensive”. In the end our house sold and we had to move into my grandparents old house since they moved. It was a nice house but I had to share a room with my step brother (23). This was only for a year but it was hell. He would never allow me in the room, I was constantly tormented by my half sister and I couldn’t even say anything because she would start crying and I’d get into trouble for making her upset. Everyone coddled her except my Nan from my mums side of family. She was the only one who had my back the entire time while living there. By the time I started secondary school, my dad and step mum divorced and she moved out. In our home now there was only me and my dad left with the house. She took almost £40k through the divorce and basically took off. Only saw her every few months but I was glad. Me and my half sister have a better relationship now thankfully but I still don’t speak to my former step mom.   Onto the issue  Recently she made contact asking for money because her monthly payments were stopped and she was running low on cash. My dad asked her what happened to the £40k and she said that it went towards holidays to Australia. As soon as she said that, I saw red and told my dad to not give her anything but he did and now she’s been coming back down to our house recently but I think she’s up to something. I really want to say something to my dad but I’m really worried if I do I might be in trouble and I really can’t be bothered to be getting in any bother since I’m already at uni and that’s already enough stress as it is.

    "self_text": "I (14F) work at an assistant living home. This is my first job and my grandfather (73M) lives there. I work in the kitchen as a server. A couple days ago I got called into the main office at work. The boss who I will call A sits me down. She then gives me a list of things I've been doing wrong. I have been working there for 6 weeks at that point.   Just to note, I'm a very emotional person because I was adopted at a young age and have had lots done to hurt me emotionally and mentally. So I was just sitting there trying not to cry when she tells me.  \"Oh and last thing. You need to either stop talking to your grandfather or talk to him a lot less. It's not good for the other residents seeing him with his granddaughter.\"  I was about to cry then. He just lost my grandmother (75?F). She is not dead but in a nursing home. I took this job just for him. A called me the day my mom (44F and their kid) called A to tell her that my grandmother won't be living there anymore.  After that shift I went to see him and started crying. I don't know what to do. If another covid outbreak happens again, I will be the only family he sees. I want to quit because in the past 8 weeks, this job has not been good to me at all. I do make $13/hour and $19.50/hour when I pick up extra shifts. I'm confused and need advice. So AITA for talking to him too much?  Edit: I got fired",

    "self_text": "Backstory: My boyfriend and I have been together for about 2 years. He had a birthday a few months back and we usually take the other out for a nice dinner on their birthday. BF picked a nice place and I called and made reservations. Prior to going, BF’s dad called to wish him a happy birthday and to ask what our plans were for the day and for dinner. BF’s dad offered to pay for dinner, which I politely declined as I wanted to pay for dinner.  We had a lovely (and somewhat expensive) meal and a great time! When the check came, BF asked me the cost and looked the check over while I happily paid.  Fast forward to a week ago and I was cleaning up our shared apartment. I picked up BF’s computer and put it in his backpack (where he keeps it). When I opened his backpack, the first thing inside the large pocket was a check. I know I shouldn’t have looked at it, but I was curious as to what it was + didn’t want to squish it with his computer.   The check was written from his dad, made out to my BF, dated the day after BF’s birthday, with the memo “birthday dinner” for the exact amount I paid for his birthday dinner (I double checked my cc statement to confirm). I flipped it over and saw that BF had cashed it online. What I’ve gathered is that BF ended up telling his dad the cost of dinner which BF’s dad then wrote him a check for without realizing that it was me who actually paid. It’s been months now and BF never told me about it, so he basically just pocketed the money without telling me.  Big disclaimer that I don’t care about the money - I’m fortunate to have a nice job and some spending money. This is more about me feeling taken advantage of by my BF.   Context: I work full time, cover the entirety of our rent and utilities, and do most of the cleaning/work around the apartment. BF has been unemployed for 1 year+ but helps out by doing some cooking and occasionally paying for dates when we go out. BF states that looking for jobs makes him very anxious - which I am very sympathetic too as I have an anxiety disorder myself. The whole check situation has just made me start to think more about what each of us contribute to the relationship.  This is my first serious relationship and I’m just looking for some advice about what to do and whether to bring up the check with him. I feel really hurt and taken advantage of right now so I’d really like an outside perspective on what to do.",

    "self_text": "Hi. So basically im a shy introverted nerd (not insane btw) and i like this girl (also shy) in my class.  Over the last 2 or so weeks i have been talking to her to built up our friendship. For example asking her a few questions about herself like what subjects she will be taking ect.  Today i was walking to the spot me and my friends meet up in breaks and by coincidence i walked behind her and her friend. I overheard their conversation and here is what i think how the conversation went:  Her: He is in my class… He is a nerd.  Friend: Who even wants to go out with a nerd? >:/  Her: I don’t even know where he lives.  Here is what i could hear.  Her: Class… He is a nerd.  Friend: Who even wants … nerd  Her: I dont even know where he lives.  I also caught her looking at me with my peripheral vision a few times in a period where we sit next to each other after that.  So a few things could be happening here: (Here you can see how big of a nerd I am)  1: She also likes me but she is unsure if I like her back. Me reaching put to her over the last two weeks may have made that she thinks that i like her too. She and her friend could have been talking about how she likes me before i walked behind her.  2: She doesn’t like me and realised that I like her. She could have told her friend that she thinks this guy in her class likes her.  3: ??? You tell me  Im really unsure what to do here and i have by no means the courage to go ask her out.

    "self_text": "TW: self harm   I am a 5th year in college who is non-traditional student aged. I was previously academically dismissed and worked so hard to get back into my college and I did! The community college classes I took in the time between was so easy and I didn’t really learn to cultivate better habits as I was able to quickly do work and still get As, which felt good, but not the same at a 4 year college. I have been diagnosed with ADHD/ anxiety/ depression since the 5th grade and didn’t start utilizing accommodations until high school. Used them and did great. College is another story as I started to having to advocate for myself and thought all of my negative symptoms were how everyone felt and who I was. I never saw those things as barriers, but as I have gotten older, the dots have started clicking. I have been embarrassed to use my accommodations until this year because past friends made comments that it’s unfair and I took those to heart. The academic resource center purged my files upon my dismissal so it’s been a mess trying to get the correct documentation and my doctor only sent in the documentation last week even though I was asking for months. I am very frustrated as I’ve been falling behind due to my mental health rapidly declining this semester upon starting a new medication that made everything worse: insomnia, more anxiety, not taking care of myself, thoughts of unaliving myself, and started c*tting myself for a few weeks. I started to make the connection that it was my new med I started and then cut it cold Turkey and have felt better, but I’m still in a disassociative state making functioning hard. I am scared to disclose all of this as I can’t afford to medically withdraw and am supposed to graduate in the spring. I would appreciate any advice for how to handle this",

Now a few years removed I am... not sure if I am believing any of that. My parents have alienated everyone in their lives, and seem to have a general hate of other people in general, and now it is sort of casting a lot of what they said about my relatives in doubt.  Supposedly one aunt has neurological problems and the other aunt is dying of cancer, although my parents say they are lying about this. I just had a spectacularly depressing nuclear family holiday, where my parents sort of seem to be receding into themselves and so I have been thinking... I should reach out to my relatives.

It looked disposable or like it came in some kind of package: it was made of partially see-through blue plastic and was always really messy. There was some kind of sludgy stuff on the side of the cup that looked black, and there was always some black residue on the bottom of the cup. Maybe it was tobacco?  The weird face and trouble talking make me think she had something in her mouth. Her tongue was always pressed against her bottom lip (sort of like she had something on her tongue; it made her look like her mouth was swollen) and she kept it there whenever she opened her mouth or talked at me, which might be why she had trouble talking.   I have always been curious to know what it was she was buying, because she always dodged the question when I was little and now insists it never happened (mum is a gaslighter). It might have been chewing tobacco or something (since it was a tobacco store and all), but she doesn't really seem the type to do that. Lots of people in my immediate family are smokers and drinkers so it wouldn't even be that weird. It just seems weird that if it  was  tobacco that she would be so defensive about it.  It probably isn't something sinister or scandalous, but I just wanted to know if anyone knew what was up. Reddit is known for Reddit Detectives, sooo... Can anyone figure it out? Anyone seen/used something like that before?",

One which I love, and the other I cannot stand. The one I cannot stand was someone I knew before they started dating. She also despises me and has been kind of a bitch to me (lol). One thing I really dislike about her is that she never bothers to talk to me, or at least try, even when she has been invited to our place for things. Generally my other friends dislike her too, she’s very much a snake and has blackmailed people. My fiancé and I have stopped extending invites to our home a while ago. I would also like to say that the other partner and I get along well and we have been on several double dates together!  Would it be rude if I just addressed the invitation to both my friend and the preferred partner? Or should I just give them the plus one so they get to choose which one (and hopefully it be either the other partner or someone else totally)? I appreciate any advice because I don’t find it fair that I have to “share” my day with people that 1) don’t like me and wouldn’t even talk to me and 2) someone I personally dislike. Thank you.",

    "self_text": "I (26F) moved to my grandmother's house back on 2020. For context, the house was bought by my parents when we moved states over 20 years ago, but after a nasty fight, my grandma refused to move out so my parents, sister and I moved instead, and she kept living there. Recently my grandma (88F) could no longer live on her own, so my mother took her in and I moved here.   My grandma is a bit of a hoarder. She had boxes full of decades old stuff that had not seen the light of day in years. When she moved to my mom's, I was left to sort the bulk of it out. However, I would defer to her before throwing or giving away anything. I was still hesitant because she has very bad memory and would sometimes deny I ever asked her, so I kept some items in case she changed her mind.  She also had a car that she barely used and I kept it after she could no longer drive. I spent a lot of money trying to get it back in shape, but it bled me out if my savings with constant new repairs, so it was sold with her blessing, and she told me to keep the money.   All of this happened a year ago. Yesterday I brought her the last of her stuff, and today she called me to ask about some missing books, and when I told her that I did give them away, she flipped out and started to ask me about several objects that I no longer had with me. She started crying when I told her as much, even when I reminded her that she had greenlit everything. She berated me about how awful I was for not appreciating any of that stuff, and even brought up how I should have \"insisted\" more about her keeping some of the money from the car sale.   Now I'm honestly feeling guilty. My mother said I shouldn't worry because I did nothing wrong, and my grandma has to learn to let go of things she no longer uses. However, I feel like I should have insisted more, or at least attempted to keep some stuff because, in reality, it was part of her history and may have had more sentimental value than what we thought.

    "self_text": "I'll try to be short. Four years ago me and my sister lost our dad (parents where divorced), now we got a 1/4 each of the house where we were living at the time (the other half belongs to our mother), a 1/4 each of a terrain lost in nowhere, and an 1/2 each of the house that my dad got by their parents (but never lived in, so no emotional memories if not the fact that our grandparents build it. NB: the house is a duplex, where another half belongs to our uncle from our father).  From a year or so I'm trying to explain to my mother and sister that the bigger house where no one lives needs to be sold, I want to go live out of the city and don't want to be poor because of bank when I have empty houses. They have changed idea many times in the time, saying that it's unfair that I lived in this bigger house for this year and my sister doesn't have the chance to do it.  Let's give some numbers: I'm 27, lived here without paying rent but I've cleaned, repaired and gave back life to an house that was ruined from previous tenants without asking money to my sister. My sister is 18, and she's asking to me to leave the house unsold, and empty, for something like 5 years or so until she can think of buy it, or not. In the meantime I'm paying rent.  Now I want to ask them to sell the bigger house, give my part of money and also buy the other pieces of property that I own, or I will proceed legally and force them to sell everything but at a more lower price.  To me I'm not the asshole, my sister is under the influence of my mother that doesn't like my wife, and she want her son all for herself and think she could put influence over me not leaving me go away. Now I'm done, I think I'm right and I'm doing it for my mental health. But you know, it's never nice to get to this point.",

I speak 2 languages other than English but they are not as different from it as Korean is.   so far I learned how to say “hello” and “thank you” in Korean and I try to just say it to people kind of as a sign of respect and also to practice. but my bilingual coworker spotted me doing this and told me to stop. he said I pronounce it badly and it is rude to speak just those two words if I am not prepared to engage in conversation. I thought the responses from clients were usually positive-they smiled. and maybe I transferred a bit… English is not my native language and if an English speaker says couple words to me in my native tongue I am usually happy that they’re trying, even if it sounds all wrong.   but I don’t know maybe with koreans it is not good if non korean speakers pronounce things wrong and they’re too polite to tell me off…  AITA?",

Some self-diagnosed, others professionally.  He wasn’t going to therapy but was taking a cocktail of pharmaceuticals that was hard to understand and keep up with. It seemed like he wanted to get help but didn’t know what will.  I knew that going in, but I never saw it as an excuse to judge anyone. We have been friends for a while before dating, so I had a more sincere investment in his well-being.  Despite some red flags in his life (lack of close friends and family, no stable job, hoarding tendencies, bad spending habits, and sometimes low hygiene), I was being treated so well. He made me feel affection like I have never before. I was on top of the world, and that was enough for me to stay invested. I loved him wholeheartedly.  When the relationship got more serious, and talks about moving in started to come up, I told him I’m considering it as long as he gets his place under control, I would help him do it.  I was gaslit into believing that we were making progress on this, but it seemed to be a trigger for him to start splitting.   In the split, he would put up a high walls to push away my feelings, and my problem solving options were muzzled. Because of the amount of issues he was dealing with, I didn’t recognize this to be a BPD episode. It was a really hurtful cycle, so I told him I’ve had enough and I left.  Now begins the discard, and it is devastating. I’m being ignored and unrecognized. I’ve never been on the receiving end of such cruel treatment my whole life.   I thought he was splitting and discarding me on purpose (not as an untreated and uncontrollable coping mechanism), that’s why I left. It reached a point where I was so hurt that I wanted to be hurtful back. I sent him a mean and confronting message just to receive any kind of reaction from behind the wall he built to keep me out.  I regret it, i feel like I made things worse. Now that I’m more informed about BPD, I wish I had done things different. I said that to him too.  I’m not sleeping, and I have no appetite. I’ve lost near 10 lbs in the 2 weeks since this happened. I can feel my hair falling out when I brush it, and I cried enough for my period to come early. I’ve lost my will to live.  I don’t want to give up on a person that I love, like others may have don’t to him in the past. Is there anyway to reverse the discard? How can I self preserve during the devaluation phase?

I wish to have friends in my life, as how other people seem to have, but I don't have any skills or anything in me that would make someone want to be my friend. Is it possible for someone like me with no interests or interesting qualities to get any friends?  How should I go about making friends, both in an online and offline setting?",

Then this app and all its junk. Then Facebook and it's junk. Like why am I keeping these? The only reasons I can think of are my memory, as social media has helped me multiple times pin dates onto stuff I couldn't recall, it being some of the only source of my media like photos or doc*ments of said memories and the idea I turn to it on multiple occasions for something.  But it's clear that it does more harm than good and I'm sick of 90% of these people who end up making comments (this is like the only sub I enjoy every commenter on) and I'm just so sick of all of it! I'm sick of trying to find communites to belong in and finding out I don't fit anywhere, including my own discord server!  I'm fighting the impulse but I'm so tempted just to burn every one of my profiles to the ground and delete all the apps.",

    "self_text": "On the work side of things: I am currently a college student living at home with a 20 hour a week job. The classes alone (Calc iii, Discrete Math, Engineering stats, and A Comp Sci class) are a lot. My job is a programming internship that I am going to quit at the end of the semester. It comes out to over 60 hours a week of mentally intensive work. My job is actually the part that stresses me out the most. I work from home and have part time hours, but I will get sent messages at random times, once I was sent a message as late as 10 PM. I'm also being underpaid for my work.  On the romance side of things: I'm gay, I met a guy whose bi about a year ago and he stopped messaging me a few months ago. He actually stopped messaging all of his friends as far as I can tell. I developed feelings for him but never expressed them to him. I managed to find his twitter and it tuns out that he has somehow become a little homophobic over the few months that he stopped messaging me. It's never explicitly hate, and its hard to describe without showing exact tweets, but its stuff like tweeting \"Go woke go broke\" when Velma was revealed to be gay, or stuff like \"The states should be allowed to decide marriage\" when we both live in a very conservative and religious state. To add onto that my parents are part of that religious conservative bunch but they don't know I'm gay so it doesn't really matter.  A third thing: I contacted my school's counseling center about depression, I had an intake session, which is an assessment. They said they would e-mail me, and they never did. I have some pretty bad social/confrontation anxiety so I get anxious about calling them back and its been almost 2 months since the intake session.  On the social end of things: I actually do have pretty good friends who are there for me. But there is this mental block that keeps me from reaching out to them.  Needless to say, all of this makes me feel like shit. I don't know what to do. I don't even know where to start. Maybe someone who's not in my current mental state can see something I'm not. I just don't know what to do. I don't even know if I'm not a danger to myself anymore.",

    "title": "WIBTA if I (F22) don't cover all the car fees on a holiday, my friend (F22) booked us for free?",
    "self_text": "First time poster. Long time reader, I also apologise as I am on mobile. 2 months ago me (F22) and my best friend (F22) booked a staycation which will be happening in 2 weeks with a voucher my friend got through her work (this was given to her for free). It covered the price of a 2 night hotel stay and breakfast for the 2 mornings. The city we are staying in is historic and pricey. We are mainly going for the christmas markets. I work as a Part-Time Waitress (still at uni) and my friend works as a Customer Service Rep (very small salary). We normally wouldn't be able to afford this trip.   I was incredibly grateful for her inviting me along, I even offered at the very beginning to give her some money for using her free voucher on the both of us. She said 'no' and that she didn't really want to do it on her own and I am her closest friend! Still I always expressed how appreciative I was. I had already agreed to drive us to the hotel and to any events/places she wanted to go to. For example, the morning we arrive at the hotel she wants to spend the day in another city nearby (my friend has never been - I have), so I would be driving us there and back. And then when our holiday ends I will drive her home and then myself.   However, I thought we were going to split petrol and parking. Especially as she booked the hotel without checking if they have any parking facilities (they don't) and the parking is going to be about £15 each day, not including the other city we are visiting. With petrol split between the both of us being MAX £20. However I did not expect her to pay half, as she has provided the hotel, something like a 60/40 split, with me paying the 60%. I thought this was fair, considering I am doing all the driving and therefore cannot drink or do anything that can impact my ability to drive. And as I am getting us discounted dinners due to the company I work for getting us 50% of dinner and drinks for the 2 nights we are away. She still contributes some but it's not all.   Well, when I asked her how she wanted to go about paying her half of the petrol etc (like shall we do it before the trip, during or after) she said she thought she would only have to contribute max £10 for everything. As she is providing the hotel stay, even though when we booked this she never mentioned it once.  So now we are at an impasse, she wishes to postpone/cancel altogether, because I dont really see how I should have to cover all the car expensives. I could theoretically cover the costs, as I am no longer having to pay for the hotel, I just do not feel like I should have too. Plus if she cancels I will have 3 days off work (unpaid) for no reason. She states that if she had known that I didn't want to pay all the car fees she would of used the voucher for something else. So I can see her side, but idk, reddit WIBTA?",

    "self_text": "I had a really vivid nightmare which seems similar to some elements of the movie in 'A Quiet Place' wherein I am at my own house by the busy road (I'm from Southeast Asia) and every family is provided this 'flashlight' that sucks energy from the sun for specific purposes that will be revealed later. Anyway, while the sun is still up, I asked my father to keep holding the flashlight above the sun to collect energy for the flashlight. We hear hoards of people outside and I vaguely remember that they were segregated into two groups by their id cards: ID 1 (center of the road) and ID 2 (sidewalk), and after this weird announcer megaphone voice lines them up, a consequent wave of sunlight flashes throughout the street (similarly like a Fade ultimate in Valorant but think of it as a really bright and slightly hot to the touch version of it). I immediately told my watching parents by the window to close their eyes as I did by instinct, and upon opening them, the hoards of people turned to ash and the street got really quiet. They got disintegrated by this beam of light that flowed like a wave.   After that event, night quickly followed and it was pitch dark (no streetlamps working anywhere else), and I for some reason, have this innate knowledge that the flashlight bridling with purple-ish energy is a warding object of some sort against the creatures that lurk the streets in my area. However, my mom stayed outside the house to 'keep watch' while my dad and I situated ourselves in the living room with the warding object while trying to remain quiet (we can hear the faint footsteps of large creatures in the distance, and the crickety screeching sound of the scarier ones lurking nearby). I realized quickly that my mom was still left outside and I ran my ass off to get her inside the house, within range of the warding object, but a creature noticed and also began its chase to me. I managed to get the both of us inside the house and I tried to put all my weight on the door but the creature was too strong, sinking its claws on my exposed shoulder. There was a phantom feeling of pain on where I was wounded until eventually I woke up today, at 7:00 PM, to the alarm blaring Made You Look by Meghan Trainor. Tbh, I think this would make a great movie plot lmao (jk).  &#x200B;  I am curious to ask, is there any symbolism or meanings attached with my dream? I am fairly new to this sub and would like to know more about your thoughts.  &#x200B;  P.S.: Apologies for my inconsistent grammar sometimes.

    "self_text": "I think ADHD has ruined my life  I (28F) have always known I've had some kind of mental disorder as my whole life I've felt like an alien and a distinct sense of not belonging. I was officially diagnosed with ADHD this year and due to the country I live in, I am unable to access medication. I'm a part of the \"former gifted child\" club.   I have always excelled as a result of my above average intelligence, however, what people don't see is how difficult the journey has been for me. A lot of last minute hustling, panic attacks, crying in the bathroom of work and having severe breakdowns which lead me to making impulsive decisions such as quitting. I have THREE degrees, including a masters in Law. And honestly I have no idea how I managed that.   I've had many really good jobs at great organisations. But there's always a limit. I get burned out super quickly and I find myself downward spiralling and burning bridges. I physically cannot bring myself to commit to something I don't love doing. It's all or nothing.  It's been months now since quitting my last job and I've been stuck in a state of paralysis. I feel like I have no interests, hobbies or passions. I have absolutely no idea what I want to do in my life career-wise and I am so scared I might never find it in the current state I'm in.   I spend a lot of my days crying and fighting with my significant other because I feel like a failure. I just want to run away so that I can stop disappointing the people around me.   I need help, but I don't know where to start.  EDIT: I'm so grateful for everyone who has commented their experiences and advice. It's really motivating to see so many people who are on the same boat. I really sincerely wish you all the best of luck in your journeys. I know there is success for us available in this world, we just have to make it happen on our own timelines.  EDIT 2: wow, thank you so much Redditors for your support. I actually didn't expect these many comments. As an update, I am eternally grateful for the life I have. I have the most supportive boyfriend and family which in some ways has been a bit of a detractor for sticking with a job, as I always know there's a safety net to fall back on. I really empathise for those who do not have the same, as I understand how difficult it can be to just stick out something that we are not passionate about. It's an absolute luxury to just quit a job when my mental health takes a beating. I am trying to implement small things to my routine which make me feel better everyday and I think I'm going to try my hand at social entrepreneurship. Exercising every day has been instrumental to improving my motivation and focus and I can't praise it enough.  EDIT 3: I LOVE YOU GUYS. Thank you for making me not feel so alone. ADHD can be very isolating and all your input and comments are so comforting. I wish I could respond to each and every one of you individually but we all know that's not gonna happen.   GOOD LUCK TO YOU ALL AS WE NAVIGATE THIS WILD WORLD MADE BY AND FOR PEOPLE WHO DONT HAVE AWESOME BRAINS LIKE US. our time is coming.  In the meantime, I'm going to just focus on being a good person - everyone is too focused on careers and moneys, there are not a lot of people just being good humans and I think that's where I can truly excel without the fear of burn-out.",

The next nurse which was my discharge nurse saw the same thing and in a completely different tone said “oh great you don’t need a pad anymore! You’re  strong momma!” Also one of the nurses told me that if I felt a lump in my boobs to call them so they can check and make sure everything is okay I did notice a bump and I called the nurses but it was when the mean nurse was there she looked so annoyed when I asked if they can be checked as if it was a stupid question. She said it was completely normal and if I want to slow down my milk production to wear something very tight. Which was the opposite of what the last nurse told me.

We met twice (we live 400 miles apart) and eventually kissed. We chat/ talk on a regular basis. She is looking for a relationship I am not at the moment but if we get closer and meet more frequently I might consider it.  She is also ambivalent on her feelings towards me; she keeps me in high consideration but is not sure we would work. She is scared to hurt or to be hurt by me. I offered repeatedly to meet in person more often but she declines; she is focused on work, staying at home with her family and going to church. She says she has no one and it reliable with her behaviour.

    "self_text": "First-time poster and parent of a 1yo here. Thus far I've found my 1yo's favorite toys are often times random things around the house. For a while it was a spatula, later the dishwasher (and its contents), and now its our broom. He's got plenty of actual toys. We actually got him a little broom last week and he just prefers our full-sized one more!  As I'm always looking for new \"toys\" my 1yo will take interest in without breaking the bank, my question is this: what are some other non-toy \"toys\" (spatula, dishwasher, broom, etc)? I'm interested in \"toys\" for all age ranges, really.  Looking forward to hearing from the vast pool of knowledge that is r/Parenting :)",

    "title": "AITA my best friend hates me",
    "self_text": "AITA my best friend hates me  My best friend hates me and I don’t know what to do  This story all started last year when I (F)celebrated my 14th birthday in December  I invited my best friend at the time 13F, we’ll call her jessica, to my bridal party party. I invited her two weeks prior to the event I had planned and she was the only one invited.  At first everything was fine however a week leading up to the party she started ignoring completely. This isn’t something I made up in my mind either, she would talk with my friends we sat in a group but when they left jessica immediately shut down. This continued for the entire week until I was able to get out of her why she was upset.  She told me that her and her family planned to go to a Christmas show on the day of my birthday party. I at the time was super obsessed with making her as happy as possible. I told her I would work out with my parents to move my party to the next day. after I told her that she became a lot happier and started talking to me again.  I went home and tried to talk to my parents and see if we could change it however I was unable to because of the times they had work. I then texted jessica this.  The next day rolled over and my parents and I spent the entire day setting up the party but an hour before jessica was set to arrive her mother contacted my mum and cancelled. Things got hectic after that, my mum panicked and screamed how it was my fault because I tried to change the times then I started crying which made her more panicked. My mum spent most of that hour on the phone trying to work something out however jessica was set on cancelling. My mum then got really mad and starting insulting Jessica’s mother.  The next day my mum was able to rearrange and jessica came over for a sleep over that night.i thought that everything was fine but it got worse after that. Jessica then told all of our other friends about how my mum had been a bitch to her mum and made them all believe I was a bitch. The next two weeks of school they all ignored me.  The next school year started and for the first full semester jessica blocked me out completely. Thing have gotten better recently however we now work at the same place and I’m starting to realise how much she actually hates me. At school I’m pretty much her only person to hang out with but at work she has other friends and when I’m around she completely ignores me just like she did that week leading up to her birthday and she only talks to me when all of her other friends are gone.  I don’t know what to do, her presence and attention is so addicting. I know if I confront her she’ll take all of my other friends with her because she’s so popular and I’ll be left with absolutely no one. I have no idea what to do, especially because my 15th birthday is coming up and dragging all of these memories up. I need your honest opinions.",

    "self_text": "So, I guess I'm not a \"new\" mum - LO is now 1 year old, I'm back at work part time, things feel normal and good and I'm happy with everything... except the state of the house.  I would really like to live in a cleaner, tidier house. I'm all for lowering my standards, but the standards are on the floor, along with the toys, the rubbish, the laundry. My partner does his fair share but works full time, often doing 8 day shift stretches, and when it comes to the weekend we want to enjoy it properly with our baby. We can't afford a cleaner (not even a once-a-month or one off clean, we tried that), but equally, saving any cleaning for when we have chance to do it properly means it takes up basically the whole day - it's boring, messy and the one whose doing it (and not taking the baby) resents the whole thing.  So my question is - what are the things we could be doing during the week (beyond the usual basic chores you can do quietly in the evenings when baby is in bed) that will cut down the 'big clean' time? Hacks, tiktok accounts, konmari - as parents, what  actually  works and helps make life easier and stops you living in slum conditions? Have you found anything that's been  revelation?  (Please don't say 'see past the mess' or anything like that - I genuinely do have low standards, but there comes a point where things do need to be cleaner and tidier than they are, because hygiene/safety + small baby)",

At the end of the night, my store manager was laughing and said just to let you know, you talked too much tonight.   I know that they’re jokes, but they don’t feel like jokes. I also know that I’m not going to actually tell them how I feel because that’s going to be awkward. I always get pushed aside when it comes to my feelings as well.   I’ve always been told that I talk a lot or that I talk too much. That I’m annoying and etc. I didn’t realize how much it would follow me after school. It’s made my past couple weeks pretty bad.   I was talking with a customer one day and my manager was with me. We were trying to make a sale and the man was unsure. He said he was going to walk around and that he’d be back. My manager had turned to me and said that when she’s talking to not say anything because I made us lose a sale. I don’t understand how it was my fault?",

Be unconcerned with my financial situation. Have strangers that care about me. Be heard.   I feel like I have nothing going on with my life. I work two jobs and go to school full time. I don't have time for anything, not friends, not family, most of the time. I'm constantly busy with my degree. It'll probably be better once I've graduated, but. . .right now I'm struggling for money, struggling to eat, can barely make rent, all the while watching these people live their best lives and be in seemingly happy relationships and travel and buy stuff.   I thought about starting my own YouTube channel. Not just for the money or to be recognized, but because I think I could have a decent following if I put my mind to it. I've always had a comedic side and ever since I got social media I found myself making original content, and I really think about buying equipment and getting started on doing it seriously. But then I think to myself, \"Who the hell would care about my content? Who would watch me?\" And I get sad all over again.   Does anyone else experience this feeling? This feeling of, \"Man I'm such a regular ass person, I've got nothing going on\"? I want to do stuff. Be remembered for something, at least. Idk.

    "title": "My wife wants the passwords to my devices",
    "self_text": "Hi all, I know this will be an issue that can be quite divisive and my position is that couples/individuals should do what feels right for them.  Me (35M) and my wife (31F) have been married for a year and a half, and have been together for just over 5 years. Since fairly early in the relationship she has asked for the passwords for my devices. I am someone who appreciates a little privacy in a relationship and have been very clear to say I am not okay with this.  I do give her access to all my devices when she asks. It's very common for her to ask for my phone if we've been out or on holiday so she can transfer photos to herself, so I unlock my phone, give it to her and go do my thing (eg. go to sleep, leave the room). I only mention the latter to say that I don't 'supervise' her using my devices. All my personal stuff (Gmail, Facebook, SMS, Whatsapp) would be accessible but I trust her not to open these things. She rarely needs to use my computer for anything but I do the same when she does ask. The only reason I would say no to her using either is if I am actively using them at the time. Suffice to say, I have no issue with her using my devices but I would like her to ask first.  She raised the point that she might need emergency access to my devices if I was incapacitated, which I think is reasonable. I have been setting up a password manager for myself, and it has a feature that would allow her access to everything (incl financial accounts, etc.) if needed. I don't restrict her access to financial accounts but she has no interest in our share investments so she doesn't have much to do with them.  My wife is very firm that she sees this as a lack of trust on my part.  TL;DR: Wife wants passwords for my phone and computer. I give her 'unsupervised' access to both whenever she asks but I would want her to ask me first.  Edit - given the nature of some of the replies: I should say that I don't think either of us is concerned about infidelity. It's mostly a situation where she wants unfettered access and me wanting to be asked for permission.",

    "self_text": "My boyfriend (m35) and I (F34) live together with our son (m2). We both work 4 days a week and have 1 day with our son. My boyfriend has lost both his parents a couple of years ago and an unborn child with his previous partner. He’s had a hard time since then.   Since we’ve moved in together (3 years ago) my boyfriend has had issues with going to the office. We are both people that need space to function, for us that means being alone in the house. I have ADD so I really need my alone time. We agreed we would ‘give’ each other one day a week without the other one home. We also agreed we would be at the office when the other was home with our son.   My boyfriend always seemed to have a problem that could only be solved by working from home.  He’s had 3 jobs and all 3 jobs have made it ‘impossible’ for him to work at the office. He was reluctant to go because of covid, it was difficult because he had to ask permission to go to the office and now the reason is because he hates his job.   I’ve also asked him to please leave me alone while working, because I’m easily distracted and need a long time to regain my concentration. He agrees to -and it works for a week- after a week he starts to bother me again. When confronted he always says he is just happy and in the heat of the moment and forgets our agreement.   Al these years I have tried to ask him to work at the office, I’ve begged, pleaded, tried to talk though his difficulties, but to no avail.  I feel like I have no time alone, because I’m either with the baby or working, and when I’m working from home, he is also home. And he doesn’t leave me alone while I’m working. I’m losing my mind.  I quit my job 1 year ago because I was tired of not sleeping and I wanted to change jobs. Also because we had a lot of fights over the above and I thought that maybe quitting my job and finding some rest at home would help. It was a tough year for me. Also my dad died this summer. My boyfriend did what he could to support me. It included doing 50/50 housework, even though I was home, so I could have done 100%. I’m really grateful for this of course.   I’ve recently started a new job and I need to study for exams. So I really need my time alone.   So an hour ago I asked him to please work from the office for two days a week. He agreed and said he would try to work towards it, but that it would take time because it was difficult for him.  I also told me I had to work on trying to learn to concentrate while he is home. He feels as if he is being kicked out of the house.   I lost it and told him to please start working on his issues because it’s not normal to never go to the office.   So, aita? I feel like I’m the asshole here because I was home for an entire year and he helped me through it and he is obviously having larger issues here so I should be greatfull for the year he supported me and just suck it up and help him through his issues.  EDIT I’ve been informed I need to add this for clarity: I work from the office 3 days and work 1 day at home, as per our agreement, my bf doesn’t want to do 2 days at work and 2 at home. Also my boyfriend didn’t financially support me during my year off.",

    "self_text": "See TD;LR in the last paragraph  First of all, english is not my first language so sorry in advance for any grammar or spelling mistakes. I currently find myself in the US but I was born abroad. Me (22F) and my boyfriend (22) have been together for the last 6 years. We started when we were very young and stupid, so we've lived a bunch of ups and downs and have learned from them. The biggest one was 4-5 years ago (we were 17) when I found out that he cheated on me. An aqcuaintance of mine sent me pictures of a couple of chats he had with two different girls asking them to hook up basically. I was never able to confirm what they did. One of the girls rejected him in the ss but I never confirmed anything about the other one. He admitted that the chats were real tho. Because I was young and naive, I forgave him even tho my heart and emotional stability were completely broken. After that, he changed for the better, but I was never able to completely heal from what happened.   In 2020, I was able to get a full athletic scholarship in North Carolina. This is important because flying to my country (where my boyfriend currently lives) takes 13 hours. Of course, I wasn't going to miss this opportunity and my bf fully supported my decision. It was really hard leaving him and my family behind but it was the best decision I could've made.   The first year was fine, we had ok communication and I was too busy in school and practice to pay much attention to details in our relationship. I was genuinely happy with my life. Then, he found a job in a different city from our hometown and I supported him as much as I could. But the problems started there. He doesn't like calls, so our first year we literally called each other at most twice. He would only talk to me through games voicechats (lol, valorant). I talked to him about how important it was for me to make calls but he never did it anyway. We can only see eachother twice a year for at most a week.  When he moved, he started hanging out with his friends more often. Many of these people are friends of mine or acquaintances, so it never felt off. It started to bother me when his female friends started staying at his house after parties and stuff. They are people I know, so he kind of expected me to be okay with it, but I still felt uneasy ~When I forgave him, I decided to trust him again, so I understand that I commited to not being jealous over things that aren't justified~. He once asked me if I was okay with him moving in with a girl (A) to reduce expenses and I immeadetely refuse. I feel like nothing good would come out of it. I asked him and myself multiple time why did it have to be a girl; he has boyfriends. I've been rooming only with girls because I respect my relationship and I wouldn't like him to feel uncomfortable.   At the end, he said that he wouldn't do it if that was going to affect our relationship, but he didn't think it should be that big of a deal because A loves and we used to be really close. Then, he started planning short trips to nearby towns with A. I was a bit annoyed because when I went to visit him he would play videogames most of the day with the excuse that I could also play. I asked him to do something like those trips but it never happened. Because of that, I decided to organize a trip to the beach. I bought the tickets and reserved everything, but he didn't help me at all. He payed his part, but he was not involved in the planning process. But whenever there is a girlfriend coming to his house, he prepares everything and find activities to keep them entertained. This made me feel jealous and down.   Right now a different girl from our past (lets call her L, she used to like him when we were not in a relationship and me and  her used to be good friends back then) is staying at his house. She traveled from our hometown to my bf's city just to spend time with him. She just broke up with his bf and her mom died years ago, so my bf said that it was a good reason for her to travel to him for comfort. I try to understand his and her position but I still feel betrayed. If he takes more than an hour to answer I can only imagine that he's cheating on me with her. I don't get how he finds so normal having a girl staying at his extremely small apartment for days and declining my phone calls when I'm trying to buy tickets to visit him. Also, he's been telling me all the activities and places they've visited, and that's the reason he doesn't pay attention to his phone. Activities include watching series and playing sports together.   Everything seems worse to me knowing that I've been insisting him for months, more than a year by now, to get his VISA's appointment and to send me his resume in english so that we can be here together. He says that he wants to come, that he wants to live with, me but he hasn't done anything!  ~We've already talked about marriage and organizing a life together in the past. He's usually the one talking about it and insisting in making life projects together.~  I will travel this week home but it might be the last time in the next 5 years. I remind him too often to do these things, but he shows concern for the next 5 minutes and then just forgets about it for another month. I don't know if all of this is worth it. He's so calm about it that it makes me feel like I'm the one overreacting. I just want to know how far from being objective I am. I just want to escape but I can't forget all the beautiful things he's done for me everytime I try. I know I only said the bad stuff but he has supported me in my worst moments. Knowing that we'll be together in two weeks, what should I tell him? Feel free to ask for more context, even tho this is already long lol.  TL;DR: Me (22F), BF (22M), 6 years together, 2 distance  We live in different countries. He doesn't live in my hometown anymore, so it's even harder to see each other. He doesn't like phone calls, so he declines my calls 90% of the time, so communication is lacking. He cheated on me 4-5 years ago but I forgave him (I know I shouldn't),  but then became the most loving boyfriend on earth.   He's always cared a lot for his females friends to the point it makes me feel uncomfortable. Now one of those friends is staying at his house and I feel extremely uneasy. He finds it just natural to help his friend to feel better and talks to me the same way as usual. However, he spends too much time and energy in her. It takes him up to 2-3 hours to answer. I haven't explicitly told him that I'm bothered even tho it's pretty obvious.  He's not doing anything to come to the US with me (legally of course) even tho he insists it is his dream. I'll see him in two weeks that I'm finally traveling for christmas and I'm wondering what should I tell him or what should I do now. I might not travel home again for the next 5 years (because of OPT) Knowing that we'll be together in two weeks, what should I tell him?",

(2 hours away from our home, idk if that matters) That’s fine with me but we have a 3 month old daughter. She says she is taking her and leaving her with her mom (grandma) for the weekend. She invited me to go but honestly the bar and rowdy college football game scene isn’t for me anymore. And also I don’t have much money right now with the holidays coming up and supporting a family of 3 on a single income. I’m the only one working and paying bills right now. I feel it’s unfair for her to spend money on dumb things when money is tight. I understand she wants to relax but I feel like there are better ways. Opinions?",

    "self_text": "I am posting this for a friend with her permission: My friend met a guy at a party about 5 months ago, he was cute so she approached him to flirt. It turned out he was in a long term relationship so she laid off of the flirting.. Fast forward she is now working for him and they are very close buddies. They go out to bars about 1-2 times a week after work, and they text often (usually just memes, music or he has also replied to her stories on instagram). He mentioned to her that his partner was jealous when they talked at the party..  He has made comments on her appearance such as \"You're so adorable\" or \"you're cute\"... The last time they went out to a bar, they had a very deep personal conversation about family and other things.. He even held her hands to feel how cold they were after she made a comment about having cold hands.  She wants to know if this is flirtatious, if she is overthinking this, or if maybe he views her as more of a little sister. We both have different opinions on this, and she helped me write this... But we are both curious of outsiders opinions, thank you!  &#x200B;  TLDR; Older boss in a committed relationship hanging out with me often, and complimenting my appearance, curious about other peoples thoughts.",

I just don't trust that they are going to be understanding or knowledgeable with OCD enough that they'll be of any help :( my last therapist had helped many people with OCD but hardly mentioned ERP which is what I really wanted to try and they weren't much help so I think I'm just pessimistic probably",

    "title": "AITA for not liking a coworker?",
    "self_text": "I've(22M) have been working at a office for the past year. you see, everything was fine there was little to no drama and i've made good friends there. Recently we have had a new employee (Zack 18-20M) In the beginning Zack seemed like a nice person and I was amazed by him, I became his friend, something however was off about him after a while whenever I came into work I always see Zack being the center of attention by saying stupid stuff, controlling what others do and getting his way. everyone seemed to love him because he always said what they wanted to hear and he always was nice to them. at first it didn't bother me the dude is just being himself I can respect that, I even found out we shared the same birthday and treated him like a brother.  after a while I often heard Zack badmouth people behind their backs simply because other co-workers didn't like them. at one point it felt like I was going insane because of Zack, wondering if i'm overreacting about the guy or just going crazy, my therapist told me to avoid Zack as he is a Narcissist.  So yeah I avoided the guy I didn't want any trouble I always go into work with the motive of just getting through the day. Eventually zack found out and wanted to talk (Only people that knew I didn't like him were my friends) me and Zack talked for a bit and we came to an understanding I forgave him and treated my mistrust of him as just a misunderstanding.  We became buds again and everything was fine, not until he had the office in uproar over what he thought was a minor mistake I made and could have fixed instantly, I tried to explain myself but he wasn't listening, My boss had to intervene and told me to leave the office and go home for the day he told Zack to apologise to me but Zack said since I hated him he will never apologise, and now the entire office knew I didn't like him.  Now we are back where we started I avoid Zack and try not to talk to him unless my work needs me to. Zack was offended. my co-workers who were nosy then came to me asking me why I don't hang with them anymore, I confessed that my therapist told me to avoid all encounters with Zack. Zack overhead me and started bitching about it cursing me and telling me a bunch of nonsense, our boss just stood there and watch him yell at me.  few months later I forgave Zack again and I told him I did, the first thing he does after that is try to get under my skin by showing me a picture from a manga panel of a character saying they hate another. I tried to explain to Zack that no its not us because we are cool now, HR intervenes and tell me to go home to avoid another argument.  Now my friends want me to forgive Zack because they somehow forget all the terrible things he does, my friends then did a 180 on me accusing me of being Jealous of him and somehow i'm the asshole when I wanted to just avoid the guy.",

I was with my brother the other day driving in house car to pick up our Xbox and he started having a conversation with me. Asking about if I'm looking for a relationship, if I want one, if there was anybody I liked. And I kept giving him short answers. I said I do eventually but I'm not looking for anyone right now.   I especially just hate him because he's in a good healthy relationship and I'm jealous because he wouldn't have been a better brother to me without her. And they're both home making sure everyone knows they're happy.  I hate seeing my childhood bully get to be happy after everything he's done to me and said to me with almost no feeling bad because it's in the past but I still remember everything and feel it every day. I doubt he would of even cared that I had cut myself if he didn't have his girlfriend.  My dad decided to look at my scars and loudly ask \"Oh have you been cutting again?\" With a joking tone. And he's seen them before and never decided to ask before so why on Thanksgiving?   When he first found out he decided to make it all about himself.  When he found out I was suicidal he said \"If you feel like hitting something hit me\"   Every single time they get on my nerves and can visibly tell they decide to get all defensive and get mad at me for having any other emotions other than be happy that they're jerks to me and always have been.  I have good talks about my life with my youth pastor but his son (18) body shamed my (ex) girlfriend (19) and is one of the main reasons we broke up. And he refuses to take responsibility. He only hated her because he was single even though he's made out with 5 or 6 girls within one school year. He thinks he's better than everyone else now just because he has a good Christian girlfriend, and so now he doesn't need to take part in the arguments about how he ruined the only good thing I had going for me.  I want to hurt them all how they hurt me and I know I can but what if everyone turns against me again?  I feel trapped and I know the only escape is suicide.",

I had been keeping the fact that that I’m in the theater program as a secret between my mother and I because I know how my father is. Well Thursday my father found out when he saw me talking to my drama teacher. When I got in the car he called me a sissy and said that he wanted me to quit. I told him that I wasn’t going to quit because it’s something that I enjoy and want to pursue. We argued all the way home and when we got home I told my mother what he said. She went off on him and he’s since been forced to sleep on the couch. He’s currently refusing to speak to me. I don’t feel like I should quit something I love because of him and my mother agrees.
