    "self_text": "LeBron James is an 18x All-nba team player, only time he hasn’t made an all-nba team was in his rookie season. As long as I can remember LeBron has always a lock to get be selected for an all-nba team (majority first team with a couple second)  However, for the past couple years he is starting to slow down (at least for his own standards), either from injuries or just age catching up.   Last season he made all nba 3rd team but there was a lot of discussion if he deserved it being his team was an 11 seed in the west. His stats however were too much for him not to be on a all nba team. This season however, his team has continued to struggle and Lebron himself has looked much worse individually.   With a lot of young forwards and other forwards coming back from injuries, is it possible Lebron might not make an all nba team for the first time and has made his last all nba team? Or does he continue to make all nba teams atleast 3rd team till he retires?",

    "self_text": "There's like 2-3 \"Is [player x] a West all star?\" posts every day on r/nba so I decided to look into it a little further. Below is a table of who I think are the top 19 candidates -- the guys that seem like they have a halfway rational case -- in a variety of statistical measures. Hopefully I didn't miss anyone that's coming back from injury but I'm sure everyone will let me know if I did.

His team is letting him down so hard. He isn't thought of for his on ball play but he's absolutely doing that this year, with rebound and assist numbers that are basically equivalent to Ja.   Luka Doncic  - The per 36 numbers actually underrate him a little since Luka plays at the slowest pace in the league by a good bit. Doesn't matter though cause he's obviously a lock.   Nikola Jokic  - His scoring numbers are a little down and he's out right now in health and safety protocols, but he's still killing it.   Near Locks    Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  - He's a step below the other three but a level above the others. He seems like a lock with his insane efficiency, but he could get shut down by the Thunder at any minute for being too good. He's keeping a pretty mediocre team afloat in a tough conference by himself.   Devin Booker  - If I had to guess, I'd say that Phoenix will end up with the best record in the West. Booker's numbers aren't on the same level as someone like SGA or even Fox, but he's had success before and he's leading a really good team. He's in.   Ja Morant  - His per 36 numbers are a little inflated as he's taking the most shots per minute in the league, which is why his WS are a little low compared to his peers. He's an electric player on one of the best teams though and he's getting in regardless. Hopefully he isn't out for too long, or that Memphis doesn't fall too hard while he's out. His absence hasn't been a problem for Memphis in the past but they weren't also missing Bane.   Lauri Markkanen  - He doesn't have the best stat lines, but if a feel good story like Utah is still above .500 then he kinda has to make it, right? That team seems like it is a collective effort more than one dominant player but we always reward the best guy when that happens. Plus, we have a glut of guards this year and he's one of the best bigs.   Likely    Anthony Davis  - Even though he feels disappointing and his team blows, he's probably the best big in the West and his numbers reflect that. I'd be surprised if voters left him off. Who's gonna beat him up front besides Jokic -- KAT? Sabonis? Those guys are good but probably not on his level.   Lebron James  - He's gonna win the fan vote, right? He's been pretty terrible (by his standards) so far thie year but he'll find his way into the all star game whether he deserves it or not. I would bet that he'll play better as the season progresses too. Advanced numbers surprisingly like him despite some really poor shooting. (BPM has always been too high on guys who fill the stat sheet on middling efficiency.)   De'Aaron Fox  - He's having a killer year and is one of the league's feel-good stories. If Sacramento falls apart -- and history says they will -- then he probably won't make it, but he looks like a different player this year and his clutch stats are off the charts compared to everyone else in the league.    Possible    Desmond Bane  - I think he's in, assuming he doesn't miss too much time. He's been a killer and added a playmaking element to his game. Probably the best backcourt in the league along with Ja.   Zion Williamson  - It really comes down to games for Zion. He's in if he doesn't get hurt, but if he keeps missing 3-4 games here and there, he might not make the cut.   Paul George  - His numbers are surprisingly low but he's still one of the best two way wings in the league. He's led his team to a plus record despite missing his co-star and having a really awkward roster. I'd pick him as one of the 12 if it were up to me but statistically he's a cut below.   Dame Lillard  - I don't think he deserves to be in, but he's got name recognition and his team is playing really well. It's been a team effort more than previous years, but he's still their best guy. I don't think he deserves it over some of the other strong guard seasons this year but he's been an all star for a decade and probably finds his way in if Portland continues to stay atop the West.   Domantas Sabonis  - Advanced stats love him and he's the key to the Kings' motion offense that's leading the league. I don't feel like he has the national respect to warrant making the team (or for the Kings to have 2 all stars), but if they continue to run teams off the court, it's a good enough story for people to buy in. His defense probably holds him back though.   Probably Not    Karl Anthony Towns  - His numbers are still good, but that Minnesota team is just too outwardly dysfunctional to get a guy in. He looks better statistically than Edwards and his position isn't as loaded as the guard/wing spot so he's got a shot, especially if they can turn it around.   Jerami Grant, Mikal Bridges  - great role players that are playing a major part in their team's success. I wouldn't be upset if they made it but they play some loaded positions. These guys show how valuable a good wing is -- they're easily worth near-max dollars despite not being a #1 or even #2 option.   Brandon Ingram  - he just hasn't played enough this year. He could turn it around with some better play as he comes back from injury, but so far his production aren't close to enough.  If I was picking, based on the first month of the season only: Curry, Ja, Fox, SGA, Bane, Booker, Luka, PG13, Zion, Lauri, AD, Jokic. First replacements would be Dame and Sabonis with Lebron as a wildcard.",

    "title": "[OC] GOATed Seasons Series: Volume Scorers. Have we been spoiled with talent these past few years?",
    "self_text": "Over this series of historical seasons, we compare across eras and between eras to obtain the most GOATed seasons.  Methodology:    We used BBref stats (https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1974_per_poss.html) and started over the 1973-1974 season (first with all stats being available), counting until last season.  Minimum cutoffs were 50 games played and 820 minutes (10 min per game for each possible game).  For each season we use per 100 possessions stats to account for pace of the game (and so eras). Then, for each season we standardize the per 100 possession stats to a standard normal distribution. The end result is a value for each player that represents how large their stat is compared to that year; which helps to account for different rules, ways of the game being played and so on. The result shows how GOATed a season is versus their counterparts.   Without more verbiage, here we present the GOATed high-volume scoring seasons!  |Placement|Normal Standardized Score for PTS x 100 possessions| |:-|:-| |1) Michael Jordan 1986-1987|4.21| |2) James Harden 2018-2019|4.18| |3) Michael Jordan 1992-1993|3.90| |4) Kobe Bryant 2005-2006|3.89| |5) Michael Jordan 1995-1996|3.80| |6) Michael Jordan 1987-1988|3.77| |7) Tracy McGrady 2002-2003|3.72| |8) Stephen Curry 2015-2016|3.70| |9) Russell Westbrook 2014-2015|3.69| |10) Carmelo Anthony 2012-2013|3.68|  &#x200B;  Notes:    For those of us that could see the \"Harden\" scoring tour, damn that was a magical season.  MJ is an unparalleled scorer, maybe with the exception of Wilt.  We have been fortunate to see many of the great scoring seasons.  It is surprising that KD is not here, but RW and Melo are.  Prime Russell Westbrook (benchbrook?) might still be underrated. It is such a shame he may never get a ring (just like Harden).   Is there anyone that can crack into this list soon?",

For me Giannis and Luka are the clear frontrunners, but I would give a slight edge to Luka, though I am definitely biased, cuz I am a Mavs fan. Luka, just seems completely unstopabble right now - scoring, playmaking , efficiency, volume - everything he does on offence is absolutely elite, for a lack of better word. Even his defence improved massively compared to previous years. Do not get me wrong, Giannis is playing otherworldly also, and he has a better team record. However, Luka did not have even one off-game (for a superstar level standart) and all Mavs losess have come down the last possesion. That is super impressive considering that they have only one player except for Luka that can playmake and handle the ball except for Luka and that is Spencer Dinwiddie.   I think that 3rd place is pretty close between Mitchell and Curry, but I would give it to Curry, due to the hard carrying that he is doing.",

High efficiency, very good shooter for a big man, gets blocks and boards.  Knows how to use his height as a strength; can shoot over players  a la  Kevin Durant and Dirk, or glide by players on the fastbreak like Giannis.    Cons    Looks really slow, delicate, and not-so-strong (for his height).  Injury-prone.  Appears to lack a certain degree of \"seriousness\". It' s unclear if he will still perform well if-and-when teams start taking him seriously.    So, is Bol Bol for real or not?   Are we looking at a situation similar to Giannis, where by his 3rd /4th season, Jason Kidd (as a coach) let him play PG to really unleash his full potential?  Or maybe a situation like Embiid where the potential is obvious, but injuries raise questions at first...until he starts staying healthy for consecutive seasons and playing like an MVP?  Or, sadly, will this be a very typical case where the player's own body (e.g. too tall and too awkward) betrays him?",

Playoffs begin April 23rd with the final ending in the beginning of June.  32 teams. Once Seattle and Vegas get their team every NBA team must have a G league affiliate.   4 divisions of 8 top 2 teams in each conference plus a play in tournament with teams 3v6 and 4v5(the two winners make the post season) best of 5 playoff series.  84 game season(28 divisional games 24 inter divisional games, 32 inter conference games)   NBA teams can have upto 20 players signed including G league affiliates.  All players drafted out of high school must play a year in the G League (to help drum up hype and interest).  Two way contracts mean players only play for an NBA Team or their G or D league affiliate. Kinda like the NHL has.  Players can play as many NBA or G league games as the team decides.  The NHL does a good job of player development soo I copied a bit of that.  G league players on a two way contract earn the same as if they're in the NBA during their rookie contract.  The league could make alot more money if they properly invested in the G league. What are your thoughts?",

    "title": "The Jazz signing Gail Goodrich made the Lakers drafting Magic Johnson possible.",
    "self_text": "Imagine how different NBA history could’ve been?  In 1976, a messy salary dispute led Goodrich to play out his option and sign as a free agent with the New Orleans Jazz, leaving a team with which he had spent nine years.   In a complex and controversial deal, Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke allowed Goodrich to sign with the Jazz in return for three future 1st-round draft choices (1977, 1978, 1979) and a 1980 2nd-round pick. The Lakers also agreed to send New Orleans two 2nd-round picks (1977 & 1978).  This exchange was arranged as compensation for Utah signing veteran free agent Gail Goodrich on July 19, 1976.   • The 1977 1st-round, 6th overall pick, Kenny Carr, spent only two seasons (and some change) with LA before being traded to CLE for two 2nd-round picks.   • The 1978 1st-round pick was ultimately traded by LA in December before the draft.  • The 1980 2nd-round pick was ultimately traded by LA in February before the draft.  • But the 1979 1st-round pick ended up being the #1 overall pick, and the Lakers selected Earvin “Magic” Johnson Jr. We all know how his career turned out (and what-could-have-been had he not been sidelined for four seasons from his diagnosis).  Is this common knowledge? I’ve been a Lakers fan my whole life (I’m only 22) but I’ve loved learning about Lakers history. I thought it was an interesting find and wanted to share with anyone who may not have known!",

Until the reports surfaced Tuesday, Smart believed Udoka would return to Boston’s bench next year.   > “From what we know and were told, it was just a suspension. We didn’t know he was leaving to go coach somebody else,” Smart said. “We thought they just suspended him for the year and he’d be back. That’s why it’s confusing. We weren’t told too much about it.”  > ...  > The news of Udoka heading to Brooklyn this week shocked Smart.   > “I think it left a lot of people just like, ‘What the hell is going on here?’ Because obviously, they suspended him for breaking a team rule. And it’s like, ‘OK, now obviously it looks like more than a suspension. But he’s able to still coach. So what exactly was the team rule and how big was it to the point they felt they needed to suspend him and then all of a sudden say, ‘You’re gone’ and allow him to go coach somewhere else?  > “I think that’s the confusing part because nobody knows on both sides and there’s not much that people on both sides can say and talk about. It’s just a tough situation for every party involved.”  > Smart said asking questions to Celtics president Brad Stevens, his former head coach, wouldn’t help because no one can divulge much information.   > “I don’t think you’ll ever get a straight answer about what’s really going on because there’s only so much they can say and that they know,” Smart said. “You can ask, but I don’t think it’s going to change anything, help anything. I think asking is just to express how you feel, whatever you feel, off your chest. But really that’s it. I don’t think it’ll change or affect any outcome. They made their decision.”      > Celtics guard Jaylen Brown said he played a role in initially bringing Udoka to Boston and was pleased to see him get another chance so quickly.   > “It would’ve been awesome if we could’ve figured out a way for it to be with us, but I guess that wasn’t the case,” Brown said. “I’m just happy to see a Black head coach end up back on his feet because I’ve seen situations where something like this might not have been the case.”  > ...  > Brown will continue to support Udoka regardless of where he lands.  >“I would’ve liked him to be here because Ime is a good guy. I believe that,” Brown said. “It’s unfortunate just to see where he was at and everybody was worried if he’d be able to get another opportunity. So to hear that he potentially has another opportunity, it sucks that it’s not here, but I’m glad that he’s able to land back on his feet.”      > Celtics forward Jayson Tatum did not want to talk about the reports until Udoka’s hiring becomes official. But Tatum said he was fully aware Udoka could leave to coach another team.      > [Brad] Stevens attended the Celtics shootaround Wednesday before their game against the Cavaliers, but he did not address reporters.",

    "self_text": "Link:  Here   I'll spare the overly long intro from the first time and give this abbreviated version- starting in 1960, this series looks to go through the history of the NBA and revote on the hall of fame classes, while adopting the rules from baseball's hall of fame. (10 years on the ballot, 75%+ for induction, less than 5% and you're off.) Every voter is free to apply their own standards- you can care about or disregard character, college accomplishments or international ones. I'll provide very very limited summaries of player's accomplishments if you decide you want to read through it... or not! Most of us aren't super familiar with the 50's/60's game. If you want to read my ramblings in a little more detail, here's the link to the original post. The mods got back to me and gave me a thumbs up, so I'll try to post the new ballot every Monday, Wednesday and Friday if you want to try to keep up and have your uh very important voice on yesterday's NBA players be heard.  #Class of 1993  We haven't had a unanimous hall of fame member since Wilt.. but looks like  Kevin McHale  changes that. The power forward joins Wilt and Cousy as only our third unanimous player.. somehow. Otherwise, there are no new inductees- Sidney Moncrief falls short yet again, leading the rest with a 70.6% total.   Paul Westphal in unable to break through in year 10, going out after picking up 47.1% of the vote. Cliff Robinson, Craig Hodges and Vinnie Johnson all exit after year two, while Blair Rasmussen, Buck Johnson, Darrell Walker, Ed Nealy, Mike Sanders, Paul Pressey, Reggie Lewis, Rodney McCray, Sidney Green, Scott Hastins, Trent Tucker, Terry Catledge and Terry Teagle are all done after one.

Career 15.6/4.7/3.6, Totals 11,931/3,575/2,793.     Leader of the 80's Bucks, who had the third highest winning percentage in the decade, yet never made the finals. Consistently made the ECF, but was always stopped by the Sixers or Celtics. Both Jordan and Bird considered him one of the greatest defenders ever. Degenerative cartilage plus foot injuries made Moncrief's career fall apart after 1986. Made the playoffs every year of his career.      Walter Davis (Y3, 11.8%):     Shooting Guard.

Career 15.6/1.9/4.4, Totals 12,809/1,580/3,591.     Was traded to the Sonics for Dennis Johnson, but swiftly injured his foot, leading to his eventual comeback player of the year award. Improbably led the 42 win Suns to the 1976 finals, where he entered NBA lore in the \"greatest game ever played,\" where he called a timeout when the Suns didn't have one, letting the Celtics go up two with two seconds left- HOWEVER, it allowed the Suns to receive the ball at half court instead of full, enabling Westphal to deliver a game tying pass after fans already stormed the court. The game went to triple overtime, but the Suns ultimately lost and that loophole was covered thereafter.     Spencer Haywood: *     Power Forward. Denver Rockets (ABA) 1969-1970, Seattle SuperSonics 1970-1975, New York Knicks 1975-1979, New Orleans Jazz 1979, Los Angeles Lakers 1979-1980, Washington Bullets 1981-1983.     4x All-Star (72-75), 2x All-NBA First Team (72-73), 2x All-NBA Second Team (74-75), 1x NBA Champion (1980 Los Angeles Lakers), 1x ABA All-Star (1970), 1x ABA MVP (1970), 1x First Team All-ABA (1970), 1x ABA Scoring Leader (1970), 1x ABA Rebounding Leader (1970), 1x ABA All-Star Game MVP (1970), 1970 ABA Rookie of the Year, 1970 ABA First Team All-Rookie, 1x Consensus First Team All-American (1969), 1x NCAA Rebounding Leader (1969), 1x Olympic Gold (1968). Career 20.3/10.3/1.8, Totals 17,111/8,675/1,541.     Haywood tried to join the NBA out of his sophomore year of college, but the four year requirement blocked that from happening- he went to the ABA instead, who created a hardship exemption to allow him to play. Haywood would then try to go to the NBA the next year anyway, and won a case in front of the supreme court that forced the creation of a hardship exemption in the NBA too, the beginning of the end of the college requirement. Late career was ruined by an addiction to cocaine, and was notorious for plotting to kill Lakers coach Paul Westhead.    #Series Summary  Class of 1960 - George Mikan (97.4%)  Class of 1961 - Bill Sharman (84.0%)  Class of 1962 - Paul Arizin (90.5%)  Class of 1963 - Bob Cousy (100.0%)  Class of 1964 - Dolph Schayes (91.3%)  Class of 1965 - Bob Pettit (97.4%)  Class of 1966 - None  Class of 1967 - None  Class of 1968 - Tom Heinsohn (93.3%)  Class of 1969 - Bill Russell (89.7%)  Class of 1970 - Sam Jones (90.3%)  Class of 1971 - None  Class of 1972 - Elgin Baylor (89.5%)  Class of 1973 - Wilt Chamberlain (100.0%), Hal Greer (81.0%)  Class of 1974 - Jerry West (96.6%), Oscar Robertson (96.6%), Willis Reed (82.8%)  Class of 1975 - Dave DeBusschere (91.7%), Lenny Wilkens (83.3%), Jerry Lucas (79.2%)  Class of 1976 - Connie Hawkins (76.5%)  Class of 1977 - Nate Thurmond (94.1%), Billy Cunningham (76.5%)  Class of 1978 - John Havlicek (95.5%)  Class of 1979 - None  Class of 1980 - Rick Barry (86.4%), Walt Frazier (86.4%), Pete Maravich (77.3%)  Class of 1981 - Wes Unseld (82.4%)  Class of 1982 - None  Class of 1983 - Dave Cowens (81.8%)  Class of 1984 - Tiny Archibald (75.0%)  Class of 1985 - David Thompson (80.0%)  Class of 1986 - George Gervin (95.2%), Bob Lanier (90.5%), Bob McAdoo (85.7%), Elvin Hayes (81.0%)  Class of 1987 - Julius Erving (95.0%)  Class of 1988 - Bill Walton (93.8%), Dan Issel (75.0%)  Class of 1989 - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (97.7%)  Class of 1990 - Artis Gilmore (83.3%)  Class of 1991 - Alex English (83.9%)  Class of 1992 - Larry Bird (93.8%), Adrian Dantley (75.0%), Walt Bellamy (81.8%)  Class of 1993 - Kevin McHale (100.0%)",

It's a whole sheet of different game tickets and the whole sheet is like $40 or $50 for like 9 games. So, behind the basket near Christmas I get to see Melo absolutely roast the Wizards. I remember my cousin and I, poor as fuck being able to go to games, the M row of the nose bleeds for like $15. I didn't care; I'm poor this is what I get whatever, but it's still under $20 to go to a game for a team that's balls. It's all good, I'm just glad to get to go to a game with my poor ass.  Even in 2014 mid level 200 corner arena seats front row or just about in the $60s, $75 altogether in the age of fees on ticketmaster, still pretty cheap. I get to see Wall and Beal actually do some fun stuff together.  I'm looking now at a Hornets Hawks game in Charlotte, and $28 dollar nose bleed level tickets turn to $50 tickets after fees. So basically double the price of my cheap tickets. I'm still poor, and I'm trying to go with my gf who doesn't care enough about basketball to want to invest heavily. It's an hour and a half drive away from where we are to go see a losing basketball team play Trae. And worst of all my man Jxmy on YT, his promo code is a complete fuckin lie.   &#x200B;  What do y'all do? Has anyone found anything that works for them? Besides having money and being able to just look past fees like they're nothing. Is it cheaper to get tickets from the stadium? I'm just looking to see if the world of cheap tickets (as in tickets that don't cost double what you see the price of the price displayed as) is a dead world, devoid of hope and happiness.",

Assume a lineup like one of these:  Fox-Huerter-Murray-AD-Sabonis   Fox-Mitchell-Murray-Barnes-AD  If there’s one team where I think it would be worth the risk, given they don’t have much to lose anyways, it would be the Kings. Especially since that’s probably the only way they would make any serious run at anything for a long time.  They already messed up their chance at rebuilding the right way by dealing away Haliburton and going for the play-in spot with Fox and Sabonis.   I wouldn’t trust them to 1) draft the right player and 2) to develop them anyways, so AD is probably their best bet if they could get him.",

    "self_text": "The Hawks have started 7-4 and Trae Young and Dejounte Murray are combining for about 17 assists per game, but the Hawks own as of now a not particularly great NBA record: the fewest passes per game by a team in NBA history (since the stat became available) at 240.3 passes per game.   Their assist totals look fine but their offense revolves so much around Young and Murray dribbling the ball the whole time and trying to create scoring opportunities off the dribble.  Trae Young is currently 3rd in the league in shot attempts after a touch length of 6 seconds or more, and Murray is 9th. Combined, they have attempted more of these shots than 25 other entire teams. It's been holding their offense together so far but the deeper we get into the season, the more their very one dimensional offense will likely be exposed.

They constantly shit on players in order to push agendas for others. And this isn't an Embiid Jokic thing they do it to everybody, but last night they were shitting on Jokic to praise Embiid and this morning did a \"pick one\" of those two. One of the best parts of NBA fandom is looking into the past and appreciating how many good players there were, and StatMuse tears town players constantly for the sake of interactions and reposts. Like I expect fans and troll accounts to do this, but as a professional statistics website, shouldn't numbers be nonbiased and agendaless?

I want to determine if the goal should be to win a championship and nothing else matters, or if you should just try to be as good as you can be every single year, by using team value.  For instance, team 1 wins a championship, then is trash for five years. What was their % increase in team value over those six years vs a team that was a consistent 2nd round exit for 6 years?  In order to do this we need a starting point, some point as far back in NBA history as we can for each team where we know the estimated team value. We obviously use today's estimated team value, and also as many data points in between that initial date and today's date as we can.  We would also need records for wins/losses in the regular season and playoffs, but we definitely have that for each team.    Does anyone know where I could find the information on estimated team value going decades back?    How do you think different strategies should be distinguished? Standard deviation?",

    "self_text": "LeBron runs a freelance offense without set plays. Each of the action starts with 14 seconds on shotclock. LeBron generally tries to drive and force mismatches. Freelance offense doesn't work with minimum players with limited skillsets. Freelance forces these vet minimum players to playmake at end of shotclock. It's all about trying to get the best and most open look. But to do that, you need all players to be able to pass without turning it over. Most Lakers have super high turnover rate vs. assist.  Westbrook offense is more simple with constant fastbreaks and/or set plays and shoot with 7SOL. Usually defense is not set. So it might not be the most open shot possible, but it's the best shot early in shotclock.  3rd Quarter:   LeBron gets ball at 14 seconds and then drives for layup  TBJ gets ball w/ 6 seconds left and turns it over. LeBron doesn't run back on the fast break. TBJ should not be trying to playmake... he's a minimum-level player.  LeBron starts action gets ball w/ 14 seconds left. TBJ 3 point miss.  AD gets ball with 6 seconds and forces up a shot.  Nunn rushes it and tries to do action early and turns it over. This is why LeBron wants to start action at 14 seconds.  Action starts again at 14 seconds. Lonnie misses a 3.  17 seconds and Westbrook forces action and alley-oop to AD.  LeBron fastbreak to Walker for a layup  Westbrook to LeBron alleyoop at 18 seconds on shotclock. Early action.  Westbrook fastbreak with TBJ layup at 20 seconds on shotclock  LeBron holding ball again and shoots it with 8 seconds left on shotclock  Westbrook starts action at 17 seconds on shotclock and finds LeBron for layup  Good run by LeBron but misses layup 19 seconds on shotclock  Westbrook finds LeBron for easy look  Westbrook tries to force action at 17 seconds. Good defense by CLE.Reaves makes wrong look and turns it over. Reaves should've passed to TBJ.  Great run by LeBron for a layup  Probably bad shot by Russ with 17 seconds on shotclock  Action forced late with LeBron. Reaves misses jumper with 10 seconds.  Late action again by LeBron and finds Gabriel who misses with 10 seconds.  Carry by Reaves.   &#x200B;  Anyway, I think the Lakers are better off playing faster and getting shots off 7SOL. Lakers really don't have the right players to run the LeBron offense to use up the shotclock and try to find the best shot with less than 10 seconds on shotclock.",

Although he started out pretty good, Demarcus Cousins was injured many times during the season and during the playoffs the Warriors squad was getting injured like no tomorrow. The next thing you know, KD and Klay are out for a long time with very serious injuries, they lose the title against the Raptors, KD leaves in free agency, Boogie is out with a ACL tear and goes unsigned for the season, the Warriors trade Andre Igoudala and it’s a big mess. Next season is terrible where Curry is out for most the season, Draymond looks like a shell of his former self, Klay is still out, and their replacement for KD is D’Angelo Russell; overall Dub nation fell off so much in one season, the Celtics had a bit of a similar situation but they handled it differently. What would of happened if they Warriors had a successful season winning the title or at least having their All-Star starting 5 healthy?",

For all 30 teams, who's having a  slow start , who's having a  hot start , and who's  right-where-they-should-be ?  https://www.espn.com/nba/standings  &#x200B;   Celtics: 12-2. Makes sense.   Bucks: 11-3. Yep.   Blazers: 10-5. Hot.   Suns: 9-5. Yep.  Nuggets: 9-5. Uh-huh.   Jazz: 10-6. Hot. How?   Hawks: 9-6. To be expected, given the recent acquisition of Murray.  Pelicans: 9-6. Fitting.  Grizzlies: 9-6. Almost-- almost-- cold, to be honest. High hopes for this squad.  Cavaliers: 8-6. Regressed to the mean lately.  Mavericks: 8-6. Yep.   Kings: 8-6. Hot, given the expectations.   Raptors: 9-7: Yessir.  Clippers: 9-7. Kawhi still missing games, Clips above. 500 but not that amazing of a record. Predictable.   Pacers: 7-6. Hot, given the expectations. They gave up Brogdon, and should have already given up Hield and Turner (who is publicly telling people to bring him to LA). Haliburton is a big part of their future, but aren't they supposed to be losing/tanking this year?    Wizards: 8-6: Hot, given the expectations. Porzingis might have a career year.   Knicks: 8-7. Hmm...Randle, Brunson, Cam, RJ (btw, I've given up completely on this guy-- just too damn inefficient). Sure.    76ers: 7-7. Cold. They're supposed to be elite and even better than last year (or recent years). Embiid, Harden, Maxey, Harris, Tucker.     Heat: 7-8. Sweater weather. They're supposed to be elite or near-elite.   Timberwolves: 7-8. D-lo's chemistry with KAT was perhaps overstated. ANT, KAT, and Gobert are doing their part, and we all expected it to take some time before they all gelled. On paper, they look like the best starting 5 in the league, but no one expected a top record immediately.  OKC: 7-8. SGA improving yet again and helping his team tread water? Sounds right.   Nets: 7-8. Cold...but not that surprising, given all the drama in recent (and present) times: injuries, Kyrie's anti-vaxx sitouts, Harden-Simmons trade, Simmons melodrama, KD trade request, firing of Nash, more Kyrie nonsense, etc.   Bulls: 6-9. Only when Lonzo is healthy can we truly evaluate this experiment where DeRozan comes in and completely steals LaVine's shine.   Warriors: 6-9. Cold. No explanation needed.   Spurs: 6-10. Yep.  Magic: 4-11. Double yep.  Hornets: 4-12. Bridges in legal trouble, Ball just got back on the court (and hurt himself again, right?), young team. Yep.   Lakers: 3-10. Ice water. They should have traded Westbrook during the offseason, picked up shooters and a good center (to take pressure off of Davis), and spent the rest of their time practicing with the new crew. Still, even with all the turmoil, this is way below expectations.    Rockets: 3-12. Rebuilding.  Pistons: 3-13. They bet big on Jerami Grant, poaching him from Denver after he showed flashes of potential, only to drop him pretty quickly and go into a true rebuild with Cade. OK.   &#x200B;  All in all, I'd say  only 5 teams are playing significantly below expectations , but  all those teams are supposed to be contenders ! 6ers, Heat, Nets, Warriors, Lakers. Crazy.",

Wagner looks like a clear star and is already a better player than Vucevic in my opinion. Carter Jr looks like a starting caliber center as well. Chicago did not handle these trades well",

    "self_text": "Yesterday was a prime example of the credit he doesn't get.   He fouled out against the Raptors last night at about the 4 minute mark. 9 points- 11 rebounds- 4 assists- 1 steal. At the time he fouled out, he was +10. The rest of the starters were about +1 or 2 individually.   The raptors ended the game with 17 offensive rebounds. 8 of them came AFTER JC fouled out. 6 of them came in the last 3 minutes of the game after JC fouled out. This is with Clint Capela on the floor. This is with the Raptor playing dudes name Koloko, Fylnn, and the OG Thaddeus Young.   &#x200B;  The knock on JC is his contract. He is 25 years old. Makes $25 million per year, and can't create his own shot..... BTW Kyle Lowry makes 26, Al Horford 27, Gordon Hayward 30, D'Angelo Russell 30, CJ McCollum 31, Kevin Love 31, Porzingis 31........ All of these guys have serious holes in their games.   &#x200B;  JC is 14th in contested shots per game this year. .01 behind Embiid and Gobert. He is top 10 in 3 point shots per game challenged. He is an excellent rebounder. He is a fantastic rim runner. He can score with either hand around the basket. He has a good mid range pull up game.  He is struggling badly from 3 this year but is a career 37% 3 point shooter. He is an excellent leader. He is unselfish. Hope one of your teams can get him for cheap.",

That's the premise of my new book, SPACED OUT, which released today (November 1). It's a book about how the three-point revolution essentially doubled the size of the floor in the span of less than a decade, how we got to this point in the sport's history and what adding all that extra room on the floor has done for the game's strategies, tactics, Xs and Os, player skill sets, and much more.  I've been editing and writing about NBA tactics for more than a decade while working for SB Nation, FiveThirtyEight, my own newsletter and now The Athletic. This book is in many ways the culmination of that work.

Cs and Bucks will get their true best lineup once Rob Williams and Middleton are back for their respective teams but so far they've done a great job with their current best lineup. Same thing with Grizz since JJJ is coming off of injury. Cavs stars have been in and out of their lineup so it's hard to really project their best lineup right now though I believe it would look like Garland/Mitchell/Dean or Osman/Mobleh/JA. Warriors and Nuggets look to have the most consistent and healthy lineup so far.",

The Pistons cut Smith, and went on a magical 12-3 run over the next month before tragedy struck.",
    "self_text": "This is random lore in NBA history, and I'm bored, I miss writing papers for school sometimes so I felt like writing this up. I'm sure some people won't care, but those who do will read it because I remember just how wild it all was in the moment.  &#x200B;   To me, The Pistons run during this stretch of 15 games was like Detroit's version of Linsanity. Seriously   &#x200B;  What Sparked The Run     December 21st, 2014, following a 2-17 run over the last 19, the Pistons play the Brooklyn Nets and lose 105-110    In the 3 years before leaving Atlanta,  Josh Smith averaged 18/9/4 on 46/30/63 splits . Joe Dumars, the GM of Detroit at the time, had signed him in hopes that they finally have a go-to guy to get buckets when they need them, however that wasn't what Pistons fans got, instead they got 1 final \"fuck you\" from Joe Dumars after blowing up the Goin-To-Work Pistons making bad decision after bad decision. In his first year, he put up 16/7/3 but his efficiency from Atlanta went down the drain, and what little 3 pt shot he had, seemed to disappear, shooting 41/26/53 on 16 attempts a game, adding on to 2.6 turnovers per game.  The first half of the following year was even worse, averaging 13 points on 14 attempts a game(39/24/46 splits), to go along with almost 3 turnovers per game across the first 28 games of the season. Something was wrong with this guy. And this game was the straw that broke the camels back for Detroit's 1st year GM Jeff Bower where he realized, this guy ain't it. This wasn't the guy Detroit originally had hoped for.  Josh Smith threw up 16 shots, and only hit 5 of them. Tallying only 13 points ,  he did  have 5 rebounds, 6 assists and 6 stocks, only to go along with 2 turnovers, 5 fouls, all 5 of them coming in the 2nd half, where he went 2/9. Seriously, Pistons fans were starting to hate this guy, he played as if he was Carmelo Anthony but performed as if he was Kendrick Perkins.  Detroit realized that that Josh Smith was  not the guy  who was going to pull Detroit out of the lottery and to the playoffs. He was taking shots away from the young guys like Andre Drummond(21Y/O), Brandon Jennings(25) and KCP(21), and wasn't delivering on them.  The next morning on December 22nd 2014, Jeff Bower gave the Pistons fans an early Christmas present and sent him packing.   &#x200B;  The Beginning Of The Run  &#x200B;   December 26th, 2014, after a 4 day break for Christmas, the Pistons hosted Indiana and beat them 119-109    Brandon Jennings and KCP combined for 29 points on 48%, Jennings had 10 assists with only 1 turnover and KCP had 2 steals to go along with his usual defense.  Andre Drummond put up 20 points with 6 rebounds on 75% starting next to  In his first game without Josh Smith ,  Greg Monroe put up 19 points, 15 rebounds, with 4 stocks  on 64% from the field.  Pistons fans we're hype, considering they just dropped the bricklayer Smith, and won the game immediately after. Detroit fans were wondering if this could be something to get used to.   &#x200B;   December 28th, 2014, after beating Indiana at home, Detroit had a challenge that was nothing like the Pacers, they went to Ohio to play the 18-12 Cleveland Cavaliers who were missing Kyrie, despite leading by as many as 15 points during the 2nd quarter, Detroit's post-J Smoove magic had them coming back and holding the lead going into the half. Detroit wins in dominant fashion:103-80    Seriously, just look at some of the 3s Brandon Jennings and KCP were hitting in those highlights, in transition  \"I'm better than you\"  3s. Jennings was hooping this night. Put up 25 points, 5/9 from 3 to go with 5 boards and 6 assists.  Andre Drummond had 16 points and 17 rebounds to go with  5 blocks!  including one on Lebron James to get the game started  Despite winning 2 out of their last 19 before waiving Josh Smith, Detroit is on a 2 game win streak. WTF?   &#x200B;   December 30th, 2014 Detroit travels to Orlando in SVG's first game back in Orlando after leaving them, where they would have another dominating performance, winning 109-86    Jodie Meeks  absolutely caught fire off the bench  going 6/6 from 3 in the  first half . He would finish with  34 points on 11/16 from the field, 9/11 from 3 .  Andre Drummond would have another great performance, putting up 17 PTs, 22 REBs and 5 Stocks, despite going 5-16 from the charity stripe lol.  DJ Augustin, backup point guard, had 10 assists off the bench.  Detroit's bench outscored Orlandos bench 55-31. The entire team was starting to look different from top to bottom. People were wondering if Josh Smith was really holding them back  this much    &#x200B;   January 2nd, 2015, Detroit would then go to the garden, where they would beat the 5-30 Knicks 97-81    Brandon Jennings played  out of his mind again ,  29 points, 65% from the field .  Drummond would have 7 points with 20 rebounds to go with 4 stocks.  Detroit's first 4 game win streak in over a year and a half.   &#x200B;   January 4th, 2015, Brandon Jennings goes off for 35 points and 7 assists after winning 5 games in 28 tries before, the Pistons extend their win streak to 5 over the Kings 114-95    At this point, people are wondering what's going on with Detroit.  Brandon Jennings goes for 35 points, 7 assists, on 14/21 from the field, 5/8 from 3, and only 2 turnovers.   The twin towers, Andre Drummond and Greg Monroe combine for 29 points and 25 rebounds.   This was Detroit's first 5 game win streak since Rodney Stuckey, Rip Hamilton, and Ben Wallace beat Steph Curry in his rookie year.    &#x200B;  National Media is paying attention to the 10-23 DETROIT PISTONS.  &#x200B;  This meme was tweeted after the Kings game: https://twitter.com/nbamemes/status/551962859760939008  &#x200B;   January 6th, 2015, the Pistons would travel to San Antonio in their closest game during the run. The Pistons would trail by as many as 18 during the second quarter. With 8 seconds left, down 103-104, Detroit steals the inbound pass, run down the court and get a layup. This game was the birth of the famous SVG saying \"WE JUST FORM A FUCKING WALL\", Detroit wins 105-104. Extend their streak to 6    If there's any highlights I recommend you watch, it's probably this one. The ending to this game had me a firm believer in the Post Josh Smith energy.   \"WE JUST FORM A FUCKING WALL HERE\"   Somehow in the beginning of the stretch 4 era, Detroit was running The Twin Towers and it was working, neither of them could shoot further than a few feet from the rim. They combined for 37 points, 28 rebounds and 5 stocks.   DETROITS FIRST 6 GAME WIN STREAK SINCE ALLEN IVERSON WAS THE STARTING POINT GUARD.    Another meme tweeted about Detroit after this game: https://twitter.com/nbamemes/status/552715688033284096?lang=gl  &#x200B;   January 7th, 2015, Detroit on the 2nd night of a back to back would head over to the Spurs neighbors in Dallas who were 26-11 at the time, and extend their streak to SEVEN. Winning 108-95    Greg Monroe and DJ Augustin took over this game scoring almost half of ALL OF Detroit's points.  Greg Monroe had 27 points, 18 rebounds, 6 assists. DJ Augustin had 26 points.   Detroit held Monta Ellis and Parons to a combined 11/30 from the field for 31 points. KCP would give Rondo hell in this game where he helped force Rondo into 7 turnovers.   The energy was unmatched at this point: https://twitter.com/nbamemes/status/553048433352011776  &#x200B;   January 9th, 2015 Detroit would catch their first L in the post Smith era to the hands of the 1st seed Atlanta Hawks in a tight one 106-103    Even though Detroit lost, it was an exciting game, Detroit was down 64-45 going into halftime,  KCP caught fire in the 4th quarter randomly , shooting it every time he got the ball it seemed like,  he went 6/11 from the field and 4/9 from 3 in the 4th for 16 points .   &#x200B;   January 10th, 2015, going into their 4th game in 5 days, Detroit would go up against the Brooklyn Nets again, who were the catalyst for this whole run to begin with. And Detroit would prove it's a better team without Josh Smith, winning 98-93    Brandon Jennings would have 20 points, 11 assists.  Greg Monroe would have 16 pts and 17 rebounds.   &#x200B;  The New Norm, Are the Pistons good now?  &#x200B;   January 12th. 2015, the Pistons would go to Toronto to face the 2nd seed Raptors, and they would win 114-111.     Brandon Jennings had another magical night, he scored 34 points   shooting 50%, had 10 assists with 2 turnovers   The Twin Towers would combine for 32 points and 24 rebounds. Somehow this \"no spacing\" was working.  Jennings got fined $15,000 for doing the big balls celebration, unfortunately it was not televised so there was no recording of it.   &#x200B;   January 14th, 2015, Anthony Davis and Tyreke Evans were too much for Detroit and Detroit would lose 105-94. This was their first definitive loss in over 20 days.   (couldn't find highlights for this one.)   This was the first game the Pistons looked mortal and not only did they look mortal, they looked  awful , shooting 46% from the field and 36% from 3 on 22 attempts.  This was also the first game the entire stretch Detroit was out rebounded. The Twin Towers approach didn't work with Anthony Davis at the 4, as he turned Greg Monroe into BBQ chicken. Scoring 27 points on 18 shots.  AD and Omer Asik outrebounded Detroit's twin towers 23-10 . Detroit only had THREE offensive rebounds, where throughout this stretch of games that was one of the main reasons they were winning.  As sad as it sounds,  this game was kind of the epitome of Andre Drummond in Detroit , he was almost guaranteed a couple times a month to put up a game like this, where he was extremely lackadaisical, and seemed not to care. SVG eventually benched him 5 minutes into the 3rd quarter after being a -20 and only grabbing 2 rebounds.   SVG had this to say about Drummond :   \"This is four games in a row where he hasn't had any energy,\" Van Gundy said. \"Tonight, he didn't even rebound. That's why I didn't bring him back in the second half. He wasn't bringing us anything tonight.\"    &#x200B;   January 16th 2015, Detroit goes to Indiana  where Brandon Jennings plays out of his mind AGAIN and knocks down the Pacers when Drummond hits a game winning put back. 98-96.   Couldn't find highlights, only the game winner    Brandon Jennings put up a season high 37 points!   Andre Drummond makes up for his last performance with a 16/16 game and a game winner.  Pistons are now  10-2  post Josh Smith.   &#x200B;  &#x200B;   January 17th 2015, Detroit beats the Process 76ers. 107-89  (no highlights needed)   Nothing noteworthy about beating the process Sixers, Pistons move to 11-2   &#x200B;   January 19th, 2015, Detroit just can't beat the 1st seed Atlanta Hawks. Lose 93-82    Both teams kind of played like shit, but the Pistons would play worse, shooting 25% from 3 on 35 attempts.  Since neither team could hit a shot, Greg Monroe and Andre Drummond would combine for 38 rebounds.   &#x200B;  The star shines the brightest right before it burns out  &#x200B;   January 21st 2015, Brandon Jennings would have one of the best games I've ever seen a point guard have as Detroit wins 128-118    I can't stress that enough, one of the best PG games I've  ever seen .  Brandon Jennings put up 24 points, 21 assists with only 2 turnovers, while shooting 10/21 from the field!   The guy on the other end of most of Jennings assists: Andre Drummond, would go for 26 points and 17 rebounds.   DETROIT IS NOW 12-3 SINCE RELEASING JOSH SMITH, THEY WERE 5-23 BEFORE .   &#x200B;  The Tragedy.  &#x200B;   January 24th, 2015, a month and 2 days after waiving Josh Smith, Detroit has looked amazing, they love basketball, the culture is incredible. They would travel to Milwaukee where they would lose 101-86 .  couldn't find highlights    - Detroit started out the game with high energy, Jennings would throw an off the glass oop to Drummond early on in the game  When it seemed like everything was crashing down on the Pistons and the magic wasn't there, the Pistons took their greatest loss of the season, after putting up 24/21 the game prior, Brandon Jennings would tear his Achilles at the end of the 3rd quarter in a 89-65 blowout   &#x200B;  I wonder to this day what could have happened with this squad had Jennings not been injured or stayed in the game in that blowout. I was always a Pistons fan, but after years of purgatory, Josh Smith literally made me start to hate watching Detroit. It was hard to tune in every night, I'd mostly just check the box score, and see if the highlights were worth watching. But after waiving Josh Smith I decided to watch that first game vs the Pacers and what I saw was a completely different team largely in thanks to Brandon Jennings, he is always gonna be one of my favorite players because of this stretch and I'll always defend his name in hoop conversations for this alone.  Ever since that run I can't look away from Detroit no matter how bad we've been however the future is  finally  looking bright.  I know this is an incredibly long post, and I'm not the best writer, but I wanted to help capture some of the magic that Pistons fans were feeling for the first time in a LONG time during this stretch.",

Even if they go \"all-in\" and make the Russ for Turner/Hield trade, their ceiling is still likely a second-round exit.   Rather than going all in for a lost season and hurting the team's future, the Lakers should really consider trading Anthony Davis. The Bulls would be a good fit for him. Not only would he be returning to his hometown, but he would be a great fit next to LaVine and DeRozan, while also being a big upgrade on the defensive end. Vucevic, picks, and filler players could be used to make this trade. That way, the Lakers could get some future picks for a re-build, while the Bulls could make a \"win-now\" move to potentially make them a contender with their core.   So should the Bulls trade for AD?",

And Ja is playing like an MVP Candidate last season and this season so far.   For Trae, Nash winning 2 straight MVPs is very hard to match, let alone surpass. But Trae is putting up better scoring and stats. Maybe, Trae just have the benefit of green light and pace of the game played today. They are also both not great defenders. (You know what I mean 😅).

For instance, I’m a Bucks fan, and I feel this team is the deepest it’s ever been when healthy, especially if Marjon can stay this good on defense and develop his offense. Only thing that’s missing is a backup 5 (Portis is a 4, and Ibaka hasn’t exactly impressed thus far). Now I have no idea who a target would be, and our only trade pieces are a $4 million George Hill, Jordan Nwora, Ibaka, and some late late picks. If anyone has any ideas, lmk.  But I’m also a big believer in the Kings, especially De’aaron, but this team needs a big that can defend. Sabonis and Holmes are both offensive-minded bigs, and neither can guard post or perimeter effectively. If there’s a way to trade Barnes for a defensive starting-caliber 4 who can play a small-ball 5? Then SacTown better jump on that ASAP.",

This comes after Jalen Suggs has played his 10th game as of today via a loss to the Timberwolves; all other 2021 rookies have player more than 10 games up to this point and thus their stats have changed.  Regardless, it's important to keep in mind that this is a limited sample size and that a massive leap in the 2nd year is normally not expected.",

    "title": "Native players in NBA history (there are more than you think)",
    "self_text": "Here are the 14 Native players I am aware of in NBA history, but every time I make a post like this at least one more player is brought to my attention. They are in chronological order based on when they entered the league.   Bob Harrison:  Harrison was the primary SG during the Lakers' early run of titles with George Mikan (career stats). He was a 1x All-Star and a 3x champion, but he's most famous for hitting a half-court bomb of a buzzer beater to win Game 1 of the 1950 Finals. He was Hočąk, and I've read  \"While with the Lakers, Harrison served as president of the Minnesota-based North American Indian Society in 1951-52. Also during his time in Minneapolis, on a night when Harrison was honored by his team, a number of local tribes presented him with a deerskin jacket.\"  He has said that he tanned dark, and once when he was in the Marines he was made to sit in the back of the train because authorities thought he was black.   Gene Conley:  Conley was part of the Cherokee Nation (link to his obituary in the Cherokee Phoenix), which he was connected to through his mother's side of the family. Conley was a 3x NBA champion with the Celtics ('59-61), but he was more famous as a 6-ft-8 MLB pitcher where he was a 4x All Star ( including playing in both ASG's in '59 ) and a World Series champ in 1957 with the Braves. Here are his career stats in the NBA.   Phil Jordon:  He was a decent center from '59-62 (career stats), and his biggest claim to fame was that he did NOT play in the game where Wilt scored 100 points. Jordon was the Knicks' starting center in '62 --and their only starter taller than 6-ft-6-- but he drank an entire case of beer the night before the game and sat out \"sick\", so the already awful Knicks who had a horrible front court had no chance against the Warriors and Wilt who had a historic day of stat hoarding.    Gary Gray:  Gray was part of the Delaware Nation while growing up in Oklahoma. He played sparingly for the Royals during the '68 season (career stats) and was then selected by the Bucks in the 1968 Expansion Draft, but he never played beyond that 1 season in Cincinnati.    Sonny Dove:  Dove's mother was Mashpee Wampanoag and after he had a fantastic college career at St. John's, he was the #4 pick in the 1967 draft by the Pistons ( 1 pick before Walt Frazier ). He played sparingly with Detroit for 2 years, then he went to the ABA's Nets for 3 seasons ('70-72), averaging 14 ppg and 8 rpg during his first 2 seasons in NY (career stats). His career ended early due to a bicycle accident, and he went on to earn his degree and announce St. John's games until his death in 1983. Dove and Gray did both play in a single game against each other during the '68 season (box score), playing a combined 3 minutes, so it's unlikely they were on the court at the same time unless they both appeared in the final minute of garbage time of Cincinnati's 20-point win.   John Starks:  In this article about Ron Baker (link), Starks is referred to as \"Oklahoma born-and-raised Muscogee (Creek) Nation athlete John Starks\". He had an insane backstory that led to his NBA career ( 4 different colleges, spent a couple years in 2 leagues that both collapsed, and the Knicks were forced to keep him in '90 when he got injured during a pre-season practice while attempting a dunk on Ewing ) who went on to be a beloved Knick who played with fiery passion and shot a ton of 3's. He was named an All Star in '94 when NY went to the Finals, was All-D in '93, and the '97 6th Man of the Year (career stats).    Bison Dele:  According to Wikipedia, \"he was of African-American and Cherokee descent.\" He was a decent rebounder and finisher near the hoop (career stats), but he's most well known as a player for winning a ring with the '97 Bulls. He had an extremely interesting personal life, playing multiple instruments, being an avid adventure traveler, flying planes, and dating Madonna, but his biggest headlines were made for his bizarre disappearance and presumed murder at sea in 2002.   Cherokee Parks:  He was named after the Cherokee tribe of his great grandmother. As a player, he is most well-known for his college days at Duke where he backed up Christian Laettner during the '92 championship season, the year of the famous Duke-UK game. As a pro, he played for 7 franchises in 9 seasons (career stats).   Ron Baker:  Baker is a Citizen Potawatomi Nation tribal member and Navarre family descendent who attended Wichita State on a Potawatomi scholarship, joining the Shockers basketball team as a walk-on before honing his shooting to become a key player on their unexpected run to the 2013 Final Four. Despite going undrafted, he played for 3 seasons in the NBA (career stats).   Kyrie Irving:  Irving is well known to modern NBA fans and is easily the best player on this list ( 7x All Star, '12 ROTY, '14 ASG MVP, '16 champion - career stats ). His mother was a Standing Rock Sioux and lived on a reservation before being adopted at a young age. She later died when Kyrie was 4 so he didn't have a connection to this part of his heritage for most of his life, but Kyrie and his sister Asia both joined the tribe at a naming ceremony in 2018 (link).   Delonte West:  In a 2009 interview, West said he's part Piscataway and that his \"REDZ\" tattoo is short for \"Chief Redz\" due to his red hair. He had a 9-year NBA career (career stats), most notably as the streaky-scoring SG on the '09 Cavs who went to the ECF. West has had some well-documented, post-career mental health issues.   Aaron Gordon:  According to this interview before his rookie season, Gordon has an Osage Indian great-great-grandfather who was 7 feet tall. Gordon is an athletic and versatile PF with injury issues (career stats). He's probably most well-known for his phenomenal performances as a close runner-up in the 2016 and 2020 Dunk Contests, both of which he arguably coulda/shoulda won.   Lindy Waters III:  Waters has a very close connection to both his Kiowa and Cherokee roots (short video & article). He is from Oklahoma, played at Oklahoma State, and after a year in a couple small pro leagues, he made it to the NBA in February of 2022 with the Oklahoma City Thunder (career stats).   MarJon Beauchamp:  Beauchamp is a descendent of both the Mission Indians and the La Jolla Band of Luiseno Indians. His backstory is unique and truly inspiring. He was houseless while growing up, went to multiple high schools in Seattle and Arizona, bypassed college to train for the 2021 draft but the gym he was training at shut down due to COVID-19, then he played 12 games at a CC and a season for the G League Ignite, and after success with the Ignite he was drafted 24th overall by the Bucks in 2022 (career stats). He wears #0 to remind himself that he \"came from nothing\".",

    "self_text": "I'm not knowledgeable of the MLB, and I recognize the salary cap is different.  However, one thing I respect about baseball is that when a team is out of the running mid-season they will trade their star player(s) to contending teams, and contending teams will trade potential for win-now pieces to, you know, contend.  Many NBA teams will stubbornly hold on to players for years with limited assets and a maxed out cap and no reason to expect that doing the same thing will yield a different result.  Kevin Garnett languished for years in Minnesota.  Anthony Davis in New Orleans.  Bradley Beal in Washington.  The Jazz hitched their wagon to Gobert for years.  I respect the MLB style of contend or rebuild, stop holding onto assets and letting them diminish.  The NBA game this is even more important because the only guys winning championships are the true superstar, top players: Giannis, Curry, LeBron, Kobe, etc.  You're not going to win a championship maxing out a top 20 player.  Even Anthony Davis who was an amazing player while on the NOP, they were going nowhere.  They finally took the assets and now they're in a position to contend for a championship.  If Davis had stayed they would have kept banging their heads and they would not be as close as they are now to a championship (my opinion, you may disagree but I think most experts would agree with me).  I feel the Bradley Beals of the world are meant to go to a team like Dallas to complement a superstar like Luka, and contend for titles.  And Washington gets Dallas's assets and can build to their level.",

    "self_text": "Doncic has everything in place to snag his first scoring title. He currently leads (33.5 ppg through Monday) the bunch of them, the Mavericks are built around him as if his last name were Nowitzki, his field-goal attempts and usage rate are at career highs and frankly, he’s overdue to lead the league in some traditional category. Also, I’m assuming his 3-point shooting, currently at a personal low (28.8%) will regress to his mean, which could add an extra half-point to his scoring average the rest of the way.  Gilgeous-Alexander has been a meteor streaking across the NBA sky, and I think he’s legit. He likes this breakout season he’s having, and targeting a scoring crown is a great way for him to stay focused in what likely will be another long year for OKC (improved but still losing).  As for Curry, he just notched his sixth 50-point game since turning 30 (11th of his career) and no one can score in bunches like the all-time 3-point king. He already has two of these titles, but winning one at 35 years, 26 days, Curry would break Michael Jordan’s stranglehold on the Top 3 spots as the oldest scoring champ (MJ did it at 35-72, at 34-72 and at 33-72 in 1998, ’97 and ’96 respectively).

I’ve never seen anything like this in 16 years of watching basketball consistently, the only other situation I can remember being this weird was the Markelle Fultz yips story which I still think is weird to this day.   But Fultz at least makes more sense because the pressure of the league and being the #1 pick + the issues with his family and injury all probably added up to get to his head and mess him up but he ultimately hadn’t proven anything yet. Simmons on the other hand successfully navigated his whole rookie contract and even showed solid improvement as a player for his first 3-4 seasons and even though he wasn’t a major threat in the playoffs, he still averaged 16ppg in the regular season on top of loads of assists, steals, and blocks. Sure people said the motor was an issue but still in terms of consensus he was at one time a top 10-15 trade asset in the whole league. Ben Simmons was electric in summer league his first year too I’ll never forget it, it really looked like we had a new LeBron level of athlete + IQ/passing hybrid player coming into the NBA.

    "self_text": "MIES (Switzerland) - History has been made as Spain is the new number one team in the latest FIBA World Ranking Men, presented by Nike. With USA holding the number one spot for over 12 years, Spain is only the second team to top the ranking since its introduction in 2010.  Spain’s jump from No. 2 to the top spot resulted from their consistency in recent years in each game of each competition. Spain captured the titles at the FIBA Basketball World Cup 2019 and the FIBA EuroBasket 2022 while also reaching the Quarter-Finals of the Tokyo Olympics. Their qualification campaigns since 2017 have also been very solid to help gain more points.  The United States of America meanwhile did claim the gold at the Olympics but they dropped out of the World Cup in the Quarter-Finals and finished third at the FIBA AmeriCup 2022.  Spain's most recent window for the FIBA Basketball World Cup 2023 Qualifiers was once again successful, winning a thriller in Italy and against Netherlands in the European Qualifiers to book their ticket to Asia.  A key component to Spain's consistency has been their ability to evolve as a national team over the years and develop a large pool of players through the FIBA qualifiers. Sergio Scariolo has used 29 players with nine of them playing in six or more games and three with nine appearances.  Spain lead the ranking with 758.6 points followed by the United States with 757.5 points. The rest of the top 10 remained unchanged: Australia, Argentina, France, Serbia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Greece and Italy.  Brazil's win over the United States and subsequent blowout of Mexico allowed the South Americans to jump one spot from 14 to 13 - swapping places with Poland.  The biggest riser in the ranking is Thailand as they won all four of their games in the FIBA Asia Cup 2025 Pre-Qualifiers in the November window to move up 10 spots to 92nd in the world.",

In the last five games, Simmons has averaged 14.6 points, 7.0 rebounds, 6.4 assists, 1.6 steals, 1.2 blocks and shooting nearly 80% (78.6% to be precise) overall. He’s shooting only 53.8% from the line but all those numbers are well in line with his career numbers, other than shooting percentage. He’s way above his career number which is 56.1. > >The sample is getting less small, too. Moreover, Simmons game is building. > >Markieff Morris defended Simmons’ slow start and explained why he’s not surprised by what looks like a sudden change in his teammate’s play.

    "title": "The story behind Haslem’s new wall by Heat locker room: ‘That wall is going to be here forever’",
    "self_text": "By Anthony Chiang  The hallway leading into the Miami Heat’s locker room is lined with championship memories. Important moments from each of the Heat’s three championships are plastered on the walls in the form of photographs to create what the team has deemed Championship Alley.  At the end of the hallway, there are double doors that lead into the Heat’s locker room. The 20-foot walk from those doors into the locker room now includes a wall honoring longtime Heat captain and forward Udonis Haslem, with the organization updating the entryway to the locker room while the team was away on its recently completed four-game trip.  “I’m not a guy that likes to reflect very much,” Haslem said to the Miami Herald ahead of Sunday’s matchup against the Hawks in Atlanta to begin another four-game trip. “I like to move forward. What’s next? What are we conquering? What’s the next challenge? But looking at that and going by it every day, I don’t know if they’re trying to make me cry. But it’s hard not to take a walk down memory lane walking by that wall.”  Among the various photos on the wall is one of Haslem’s face with blood dripping from his right eye after taking an elbow from Lou Amundson in Game 4 of a second-round playoff series against the Indiana Pacers, and another of Haslem celebrating after hitting a game-winning shot over Antawn Jamison to lift the Heat to a two-point victory over the Washington Wizards in March 2007.  “I don’t reflect often, but it’s hard not to reflect on those times and those memories when you see that wall,” Haslem said. “So it literally just took me back in time to those shots. That shot against Washington and Antawn Jamison, getting hit in the eye against Indiana. It just takes me back to those moments.”  In the middle of the Haslem collage is a message on the wall that reads, “Forged in the fire between a hammer and anvil,” in big white letters. It’s a quote the Heat refers to when discussing its “culture,” pulling from the well-known quote of: “Character is not made of sunshine and roses. Like steel, it is forged in fire, between the hammer and the anvil”.  Undrafted out of Florida in 2002, Haslem has become the face of the Heat’s “culture.” He has played a role on each of the organization’s three championship teams and is the only undrafted player in NBA history to lead a franchise in total rebounds.  “I think I’ve embodied this culture from the bottom to the top,” Haslem said. “I think everything that I’ve been able to accomplish on and off the basketball court has been because of Heat culture. I think not very many people are willing to commit the way you have to commit when you want to be a part of this culture.”  Haslem first discovered the wall when he arrived for the Heat’s home game against the Washington Wizards on Wednesday. He said he had “no idea” the team was planning to honor him in that way and that he even walked by it at first without noticing until a staff member pointed it out to him.  “Instantly, when I looked at it, I didn’t notice what I was looking at. Then I was like, ‘Oh, wow. All of these are pictures of me,’” Haslem said. “Then you start taking those walks down memory lane and remembering those moments. I was thinking I was a pretty decent player at one point, I was pretty good.”  Haslem, a Miami native, is on track to spend his entire NBA career of 20 seasons with the Heat before retiring at the end of this season. Haslem will join Dirk Nowitzki (21 seasons with Dallas Mavericks) and Kobe Bryant (20 seasons with Los Angeles Lakers) as the only players in league history to spend an entire NBA career lasting at least 20 seasons with one team, and Haslem is the the only one to do it in his hometown.  “I think about it, just like the guys like Alonzo [Mourning] and Grant Long and Glen Rice and Voshon Lenard, Tim Hardaway, Ike Austin, P.J. Brown. I’m probably naming names that a lot of people don’t know, but these are the guys I watched come before me. Even though they’re not on that wall, they embody Heat culture as well. I’ve just taken a piece of all those guys and I’ve put it into how it works for me in the modern day. Without those guys, I’m not here.”  The Heat switches out photos on some of the walls around the locker room every few years. But the plan is for the new Haslem wall to be a fixture moving forward.  With the 42-year-old Haslem set to retire at the end of this season, it’s not hard for him to imagine what it will feel like for him to walk past his wall when he’s not on the Heat’s roster anymore. His hope is that he’ll be a part of the Heat’s ownership group when that moment comes.  “It will be cool,” Haslem said. “Hopefully I’m up there in the office and I get to come down and have those conversations and talk about that with guys. But yeah, that wall is going to be here forever.”  https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/nba/miami-heat/article269265587.html",

Keep in mind these are hard because I have to factor in fit and what the team would probably want right now as opposed to back in 2020 Here we go...   1. T-Wolves Anthony Edwards OG Drafted: Anthony Edwards   22.2 PPG, 5.7 RPG, 3.5 APG, 55.1 ts%  I consider Ball to be the better player and the slightly better fit but imo Ants ceiling is so high Id still go with Ant.   2. Warriors Lamelo Ball OG Drafted: James Wiseman   (last season) 20.1 PPG, 6.7 RPG, 7.6 APG, 55.4 Ts%  Ball is talented, a highlight machine, elevates his teammates making him the perfect leader for a rising small market franchise but here he adds to the offensive juggernaut Warriors. He would be so fun to watch alongside Curry.   3. Hornets Tyrese Haliburton OG Drafted: Lamelo Ball   21.7 PPG, 5 RPG, 9.7 APG, 64.2 ts%  They take a loss without Ball but they get a similarly skilled PG with elite playmaking and efficient scoring. A probable future multiple time allstar.   4. Bulls Desmond Bane OG Drafted: Patrick Williams   24 PPG, 5 RPG, 4.6 APG, 61.8 ts%  Bane is an amazing fit on the Bulls, a lights out shooter who can play defense and score off the dribble. Easy pick   5. Cavs Devin Vassell OG Drafted: Isaac Okoro   20.7 PPG, 4.1 RPG, 4 APG, 59.9 ts%  Vassell is another perfect fit with Cavs team.   6. Hawks Tyrese Maxey OG Drafted Onyeka Okongwu   23.6 PPG, 3.5 RPG, 4 APG, 57.8 ts%  Its hard to do these imaginaries redrafts with trades happening but Maxey is too good to care about fit. Run a 3-guard lineup if you have to, Maxey is too good to pass on   7. Pistons Saddiq Bey OG Drafted Killian Hayes   17 PPG, 4.8 RPG, 1.5 APG, 61.4 ts%  Ironically they still end up with Bey, you could go Okongwu but I like them keeping Bey   8. Knicks Obi Toppin OG Drafted Obi Toppin   10.8 PPG, 4 RPG, 1.2 APG, 62.4 ts%  Imo Obi is the clear BPA here despite the bad fit. He catches lobs, hits threes, is high energy. He could be scoring 16-18 ppg on 30 mpg on a rebuilding team like the Thunder, Pistons, or Spurs yet here he makes one of the best back ups in the league on the Knicks.   9. Wizards Onyeka Okongwu OG Drafted Deni Avdija   8.6 PPG, 5.2 RPG, 0.7 BPG, 67.6 ts%  I would love to see what he could do as an NBA starter; I think he could be a really solid starting big   10. Suns Jaden Mcdaniels OG Drafted Jalen Smith   9.9 PPG, 3 RPG, 1.3 BPG 63.4 ts%  Suns get a good defender to pair with CP3, Book, Mikal, Ayton. He could probably start at the 4   11. Spurs Patrick Williams OG Drafted Devin Vassell   9 PPG, 3.7 RPG, 0.8 BPG, 67.6 ts%  A rebuilding team like the Spurs could be a great fit for Pat. He gets a bunch of minutes and opportunity on a rebuilding team, where he can be molded by Pop who helped create Kawhi who was very similar to Pat around the same age   12. Kings Cole Anthony OG Drafted Tyrese Haliburton   15.5 PPG, 4.8 RPG, 4.3 APG 52 ts%  Kings could use Cole as a 6th man scorer   13. Pelicans Isaiah Stewart OG Drafted Kira Lewis   12.5 PPG, 9.9 RPG, 0.7 BPG, 59 ts%  You could argue him going higher and I wouldn't complain   14. Celtics Immanuel Quickley OG Drafted Aaron Neismith   8 PPG, 5.4 RPG, 3.2 APG, 48 ts%  Quickley hasn't been good this season but you take him with the hopes of improving his stats and being a positive contributor off the bench for the Celtics   15. Magic: Kenyon Martin Jr OG Drafted: Cole Anthony   11.3 PPG, 4.7 RPG, 1.8 APG, 58.6 ts%  Another young piece to add to the rebuilding Magic   16. Pistons James Wiseman OG Drafted Isaiah Stewart   7.3 PPG, 4 RPG, 0.9 APG, 62.8 Ts%  A rebuilding team can afford to take the flyer on the disappointing 2nd pick. He is very similar to Duren but there's enough minutes to spread and let them compete for starting center in the future.   17 Thunder Precious Achiuwa OG Drafted Aleksej Pokusevski   9.2 PPG, 7.1 RPG, 1.4 APG, 51.3 ts%   18 Mavericks Payton Pritchard OG Drafted Josh Green   2.3 PPG, 0.3 RPG, 1.3 APG 44.4 Ts%  You already have Javale, Powell, Wood, Maxi so you dont need a big. Id take PP and see if he could earn some rotation minutes   19. Pistons Isaac Okoro OG Pick: Saddiq Bey   2.2 PPG, 1.5 RPG, 0.4 APG, 36.6 ts%  Okoro has struggled heavily this season but he brings a lot of defensive upside to a young Pistons team   20. Heat: Jalen Smith OG Pick: Precious Achiuwa   11 PPG, 8.1 RPG, 0.9 BPG, 53.6 ts%",

    "self_text": "Now I love Luka and want to make it clear this isn’t to shit on him, I’d love to just have a discussion about it. Watching him on the offensive end of the ball hit ridiculous mid range fadeaway after fadeaway, even when they’re contested feels illegal. The dude rightly gets a tonne of credit for what he can do offensively.   But I feel like people rank him top 5 etc purely based on this, without taking his defence into account. Take the game against the C’s last night for example, the C’s just blew by him on the defensive end, possession after possession. And his help defence and defensive awareness just isn’t there to the point where the C’s get so many open threes.   There’s been comments in another post saying ‘Luka did his best to make it a game’. I’d argue he’s the reason the C’s had such a big lead in the first place with how absent he is on the defensive end. Like I agree, offensively he was unreal, but if the C’s are scoring past him so easily how many of this 42pt effort does that negate?   Again, full credit for how unreal he is on the offensive end, undoubtedly generational. But I feel like we aren’t honest about how poor his defense can be when putting him into the top 5. He can lose the Mavs as many points as he gives them.  Edit: Some of y’all have made some really compelling points. Not going to take the post down as I think it’s an interesting discussion. Equally some of the comments I put, no need to remove them. But it’s fair to say Luka’s offence is superstar like and he deserves his place to be ranked as highly as he is.",

    "self_text": "The Dinwiddie/Porzingis trade was seen by many fans (including myself) as an absolute fleecing by the Wizards. But revisiting it a season and change later, it looks good for both.   Dinwiddie in 2021-22 season with Dallas: 16/3/4/1 on 50/40/73  Dinwiddie in 2022 playoffs: 14/2/4 on 42/42/82  Dinwiddie in 2022-23 season: 19/6/5 on 49/46/81   The three-point shooting has been insane in particular for a career 33% shooter. I was down on the trade because he was shooting 38/31/81 with the Wizards last season, and according to Wizards fans he was a locker room problem for them. Fortunately those problems haven't manifested here. Last season, he led us to multiple crazy comebacks and had a buzzer beater in Brooklyn. In the playoffs, he was awful for most of the Jazz and Suns series but kicked it into another gear for their Game 6s and the Suns Game 7. This year, he's slotted into Brunson's starting role and has done a great job as the team's second option, especially in the last few games where he's been nuclear from 3.   Porzingis in 2021-22 season with Washington: 22/9/3 on 48/37/87  Porzingis in 2022-23 season: 20/8/2 on 50/35/83   I haven't watched the Wizards much since the trade (besides their scheduled shellackings of us) but it looks like KP has been good for them. You could argue that that's bad, since the Wizards need to blow it up yesterday, but if their goal is to compete for a playoff spot, KP is helping to keep them in that mix. I think many Dallas fans are relieved KP is gone because of his injury history, but it looks like he hasn't gotten injured much if at all in Washington yet.",

    "self_text": "James Wiseman didn’t play a single minute tonight. It’s clear that he’s out of the Warriors rotation. Instead, the Warriors replaced him with Jonathan Kuminga (who has a lot more potential anyways). If the Warriors do play a backup 5, Steve Kerr was on record saying he’ll play JaMychal Green more at the 5. He might make his way back into the Warriors rotation with some injuries, but right now, he’s on the outside. I think Kuminga is just flat out better, so I don’t think he’ll lose his spot.   The Warriors are also looking to win this year and next year, so we won’t be prioritizing developing young players. If you aren’t contributing, you will get benched. So far, Wiseman has been horrendous according to advanced metrics. He was terrible in his rookie year and this year, he is again at the very bottom of RAPTOR rankings. The eye test also confirms all of this. He also has not developed any part of his game since his rookie year. The worst part is that he’s the worst pairing with Steph, who is our best player. This practically makes him unplayable.   He is also in his 3rd year of his rookie deal, which means he really only has 1 more year. Since we are way over the luxury cap, it’s unrealistic to sign him to a second deal if he doesn’t show he can contribute.   Wiseman seems like a nice guy, and I hope it works out. But he has just been terrible when he’s on the floor, and with the way things went tonight, there’s a good chance his Warriors career is in jeopardy. He might latch on to like a rebuilding team in 2 years in FA, but he probably won’t be signed at this rate. An alternative is he’s traded at the trade deadline for a veteran player. His value is pretty low now though, at best being worth a late first rounder. This is also not an overreaction and although he is “young,” that doesn’t mean he can turn it around on this particular team.",

The league was definitely not as talented as it is now but this season was pretty special for the following reasons:    Dozens of icons of the game and hall of famers in which many from the previous generation were still elite. Lebron, Kobe, Duncan, KD, Wade, Dirk, KG, CP3, Nash, Pierce, Dwight, Kidd, Westbrook, Carmelo, Ray Allen, T-Mac, Pau, Hill, Manu, Parker, Rose, Bosh, Carter, etc... Then emerging stars in Steph, Harden, PG, K-Love, Derozan, Klay, Blake Griffin, Ibaka, etc... Shaq and Yao were in their last seasons too    Many memorable teams in the league like Lob City, Kobe/Pau Lakers, Big 3 Celtics, Heat superteam, champ Mavs, young OKC, Spurs, We Believe Grizzlies, Brandan Roy Blazers, D-Rose Bulls, automatic W against the T-Wolves, etc...     The year ended with the Mavs winning the final which was a miracle run and an all time performance by Dirk Nowitzki. Unbelievable story and it's one of the most impressive championships. While the league would be dominated by super teams in the future, this title gave hope to smaller maket franchises and superstars playing with them    I really think this was the turning point of the NBA focusing on spacing and shooting from ISO ball previously. Sure it had been developing for at least 5 years but Dallas winning with that style kinda broke the floodgates because Miami changed their system into small-ball afterwards. Their shift was successful for two titles. Golden State turned it up 3 notches but still    This year was right after \"The Decision\", everyone HATED Lebron and he turned into the villain of the NBA. I can't imagine what this place would be like if that happened today. But everyone besides Heat fans were rooting against Miami     There was also melodrama and the D-Williams trade which contributed to Jerry Sloan retiring from the Jazz    I think this 2011 is the GOAT NBA season but what is your take? I have nostalgia for early 2010s basketball because it had both elements of the past and present",

Pelinka admitted as much on media day in September. \"You have one shot to make a trade with multiple picks,\" he said. \"So if you make that trade, and I'm not talking about one particular player on our team, but it has to be the right one.\"  >Otherwise, maybe there is a way to seek one deal centered on Westbrook and one of the two picks, and another using something like Patrick Beverley's salary ($13 million) and Kendrick Nunn's ($5.3 million) -- the only other contracts on the Lakers' books hefty enough to pair together to salary match for a proven player -- plus the other pick to add another player of consequence.  >But the clock is ticking. Even with improved play as of late, at 7-11 L.A. is still three games out of the final play-in spot in the Western Conference.  >And the schedule is unforgiving leading up to the mid-January timeline when L.A. anticipates offers could materialize. Including Monday's game against the Pacers, 15 of the Lakers' next 23 games between now and Jan. 9 are on the road. If at that point, nearly 40 games into the season, the Lakers are still below .500 -- a reasonable concern considering L.A. is 2-6 on the road so far -- would leveraging the future to pour into this group be worth it?  >Or should the Lakers play this season out with the roster as currently constructed, use salary-cap space to sign free agents in the summer and explore trades involving picks after draft night when they will have the player they selected with their 2023 first-round pick available to deal?  >For now in Lakerland, there remain far more questions than answers.

    "title": "An outcome based approach to coach's challenges",
    "self_text": "I was told it might be useful to post this here with no games today it might be worthwhile topic to discuss. I am talking about coach's challenges. It has been around a couple of years now and there still doesn't seem to be a consensus about how they should be used. Here is my proposal that I am hoping will spark some discussion here.  Some believe they should be kept until the end of the game where the challenge might be more decisive. Others believe they should be used when the coach is confident in winning the challenge because you may never get a challenge opportunity late in the game and it is better than never making use of them.  Since there is only 1 challenge per team per game it is a scarce resource. I think there is a more scientific way to decide when to use the challenge by looking not only at the how probable it is to win the challenge, but the value of the outcome. I see this a lot where commentators talk about a challenge being good because the team wins it, but they never look at the value of the outcome when deciding if it is worthwhile. I suggest an approach that takes into account the outcome of the challenge and when during the game it is made.   Rule:  Only challenge when you are confident you will win.  This is simple in theory but difficult in practice. Given the short time and access, or lack of, to proper replays. This condition just means that no matter how pissed off the coach or the players are about a call, there is no point in challenging unless there is a strong chance of overturning. Even if you strongly believe that the call is wrong it doesn't mean that the refs will see it that way even with the replay. So while this might not raise the challenge success rate to something extremely high, but is rather meant to get rid of hopeless challenges.   This of course can be ignored in the last minute of the game if you have a use it or lose it situation. If you aren't confident about winning the challenge and have a time out to use, might as well challenge.  So how do we decide when to use a challenge?    Case 1:  Foul Trouble for the star player.  If the challenge gets your team's star out of foul trouble, or gets your opponents star into foul trouble then it should be taken, as long as condition 1 applies. Forcing a star player to sit is more impactful than reversing any 1 play. So it should be used in this case.   Case 2:  If the value of the outcome of a successful challenge is greater than or equal to 2 you should challenge.  Lets us place a value to all possible outcomes of the challenge.  Outcome | Value --- | --- Jumpball | 0.5 Foul switched to opposite team | 0.5 Gaining Possession | 1 Points added/removed | # of points added/removed FTs added/removed | # of FTs added/removed  So the holy grail of challenges is changing an \"and 1\" blocking call to a charge or vice versa.  Let us say you have a basket that was taken off for a charge and you are confident that it should be a blocking foul. Then the outcome of a successful challenge would be 0.5 for a foul switch + 2 for the points of the made basket + 1 for the FT. So the value is 3.5 and is worth a challenge.  If you feel confident about a challenge in the 1st quarter and the outcome of the challenge is gonna be just a jump ball if you win, then it is better off holding on to the challenge and maybe getting more value out of it later on. Maybe it is an incorrect out of bounds call made in the early game, well that is only worth 1 point (gain possession), and isn't worth the challenge.   Case 3:  In the final 5 minutes any challenge is worth making.  No point in waiting to get the highest value from the challenge at this point. Any small win is better than ending the game with an unused challenge. So while you shouldn't challenge an out of bounds play early in the game it makes sense to do it in the final 5 minutes.   Closing Thoughts   I think with more data one could tweak some parameters, like the value threshold of challenge or at which minute to lower the threshold. But I am happy with the general idea. I am interested in hearing some of the other thoughts about when to use the coach's challenge.",

Magic was 24 at the time, so the contract anticipated that he would play (or at least get paid) until he was 49 years old!  Given that there are players scheduled to make more than DOUBLE that, it's clear that this is no longer the richest contract, even when adjusted for inflation), but it does remain the LONGEST NBA contract and will hold that record for the foreseeable future (unless the bargaining agreement rules drastically change).  Magic rewarded Dr. Buss's faith in him with three titles and five finals appearances over the next 7 seasons before his HIV diagnosis lead to his withdrawal from the league.  But on a interesting side not, the Lakers were STILL paying Magic up until 2010!  That means that Magic was on the books for FIVE MORE TITLES (bringing his polemic ring count to 10). He technically won a title his 'last' season.  With Kobe.  That means that Magic was still getting paid to play basketball while LeBron was winning MVP in his last season for the Cavs.  When Steph Curry was drafted, the Lakers were still paying Magic for his basketball services.  Of course Magic wasn't expected to play until the age of 49: The contract was structured such that they could pay Magic all he wanted while not taking too hard a hit on the cap (which was still hard as far as I can remember).",

I am not really knowledgeable when it comes to bb defensive schemes, so I am curious how will your set your team up in this hypothetical scenario?

Speaking with ESPN on Wednesday before his Mavericks played the Celtics, Doncic called Boston the NBA’s best team and Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown its best duo, an opinion that’s been growing in popularity.  “They’re probably the No. 1 team in the league, and they probably have the best duo in the league, too,” Doncic said. “And we’re in the Garden — it’s always a special game. You have to come 100 percent. If you’re not, you’re probably going to lose. It’s a big game.”  The Celtics have the NBA’s best record at 13-4 even after Monday’s 121-107 loss to the Chicago Bulls. Tatum and Brown are the league’s top-scoring pair averaging 30.2 and 25.3 points respectively. But Doncic said the way their skills mesh increases their value beyond simply combining their statistics.  “Just watching their game,” Doncic said. “I think a lot of people can see that. I think the way they play. I know people try to separate them but they fit together, they went to the Finals last year, so I think those two are really great players.”  Tatum is questionable to play Wednesday night.  The Mavericks arrive in Boston as the No. 8 seed in the West coming off of a split of back-to-back games with Denver. Doncic leads the NBA in scoring at 33.5 points and is fourth with 8.5 assists. \"  Source: https://www.masslive.com/celtics/2022/11/luka-doncic-celtics-are-nbas-top-team-jayson-tatum-jaylen-brown-its-best-duo.html?src=rss  &#x200B;  High praise from Luka here, and he is entirely right about how dumb it was that people wanted to split them up.

    "self_text": "Quick Summary:  So, I got bored and decided I'd throw together an NBA ratings system for the 2021 season. In short, the rating uses over a dozen key stats (2pt shots made and missed, 3pt shots made and missed, free throws made and missed, offensive and defensive rebounds, steals, blocks, turnovers, opponent 2pt shots made and missed, and opponent 3pt shots made and missed) to compile a final number that's meant to act like a \"point differential.\" Ex: If player A has a total rating of 100 and player B has a total rating of 50, player A would be expected to have added about 150 more points to their team's total point differential than player B. Here's the dropbox link for the 2021 ratings.  &#x200B;  More detailed explanation:  To start the ratings process, I decided to create a model using total stats for each 2021 game to predict the point differential for those games. The final model resulted in all of the stats listed above being used as predictors, with point differential as the response. Principle Components of Analysis were used when modelling in order to avoid multicollinearity. Assists were specifically removed from these ratings since the resulting model would have had a negative value for its regression coefficient. After I decided on a final model, I combined the regression coefficients and PCAs, so that I would have a single value for each original predictor variable. I then took the corresponding player data for each statistic during the 2021 regular season and multiplied those by the values for each original predictor variable. Those values were then combined into a final total rating, and a final per minute rating.  &#x200B;  Sources:  Basketball-Reference.com for 2021 modelling data  NBA.com for 2021 player data  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  If you have any other questions, please let me know!",

That is of course mainly due to Luka having an MVP worthy start of the season, but I am on the opinion that if Kidd's rotations were a bit better, they could have snatched a few more wins. I think that almost all of the Mavs fans agree with me.  The main problem I see is that it looks like Kidd has his rotations already made up before the game and no matter what happens, he sticks to them. I am not talking about only ingame management. Not only he makes zero adjustments during the games, but he also plays the same players the same minutes basically every game, no matter how they performed.   Obviously, the most mind blowing case is with Christian Wood. CWood has been efficient, he seems to have a great chemistry with Luka and offers a variety of offensive skills that the Mavs roster as whole severely lacks. Despite that, Kidd is insistant on not starting him and playing him bench minutes. It has come to the point that Wood himself and even Luka publicly voiced their frustration.   Another example is THJ. This guy has the greenlight to do whatever and to shoot the ball at the start of the shot clock whenever he fells like it, despite bricking almost every shot so far. Not only is Kidd allowing this behaviour, but he is encouraging it by playing him nearly starter minutes, despite the fact that Hardaway is a pretty bad defender to say the least.  The fact that Kidd rarely changes the players minutes not only during a particular game, but from game to game too, screams heavy favouritism to me and stubborness.   Another thing that frustrated me about Kidd is that it seems like he is completely unable to draw set plays. This is most obvious at the end of close games. I am nearly 100 percent sure that the Mavs haven't done anything else than shoot a prayer 3, when losing by 3 or less points at a final possesion.  Kidd should be credited for improving the Mavs defence and for helping the development of some of the players. Also, I doubt that there is another coach in the league that could do much better him with the current Mavs roster as currently build. However, I think that he has proven to be a very stubborn and boneheaded coach, that severely lacks the capability to make offensive adjustments. I am curious what  the fans of his previous teams think about this. Was he always like that?",

    "self_text": "Link to box score  This is such a weird box score, even by Wilt's standards, especially when you consider that 1967 is the year where the Philadelphia 76ers dominated the NBA, going a then-record 68-13, crushing the Bill Russell-led Celtics in a gentlemen's sweep in the ECF. In game 5, Wilt went for a cool 29-36-13 in 44 minutes and then beat the Warriors 4-2.  But it's only the third-most minutes played without attempting a shot. Second is, of course, also Wilt, when he put up a 2-14-4 in 46 minutes against Kareem on the last day of the regular season. Wilt's Lakers also made the finals that year but lost to the last truly great Knicks team in 5.  Number 1 on the list is Ben Wallace, someone who makes a lot more sense. Ben played 47:47 in an OT loss for Chicago against Lebron's Cavs and put up a 2-12-3 in that game. This game is much less interesting, although Wallace had a 134 offensive rating, way higher than Lebron's 116. Lebron had 39-5-9 but tossed in 7 turnovers. Okay, the game is kind of interesting.  I went down this rabbit hole thanks to basketball reference's tweet that pointed out that Grant Williams's 0-0 FG in 38 minutes last night was the 11th highest minute count on record. (I saw another post where statmuse tweeted this, but called it the 8th most)",

Bar Jokic - easily the GOAT passing big - you don't see those assist numbers from a big man very often. Especially not with the scoring volume of nearly 40ppg.   Most impressive of all to me? His defense. The STOCKs numbers are obviously great, but even beyond that as a general deterrent and rim protector he's been phenomenal. He started the year slow on this end, but has easily turned it up to DPOY level with the 76ers now boasting the league's 3rd best defense. There are tons of times throughout these games where he has singlehandedly shut down an opposing offense.   He's also been incredibly clutch for the 76ers. He scored the Sixers last 11 points on 84%TS to finish a comeback against Atlanta last night. He hit three straight jumpers to put the Bucks away with 3 minutes left. He had 26 of the Sixers' 27 points in the 4th quarter of his masterclass v. Utah. None of this is even mentioning the late game stops he made on the other end.   Scoring at an all-time level, incredibly clutch, passing at an all-time level for a big, and playing at a DPOY level on the other end. Embiid's been the total package lately and looks like he's elevating his game to another level this season.   Over this stretch of games the Sixers are 4-1 with victories over Atlanta(2x), Utah, and Milwaukee.  Source",
