    "self_text": "Major Spoilers  All through GoW ‘18 we hear about how bloody and sadistic Thor is, meanwhile Baldr, Magni and Modi are psychotic. They build up that Asgard is basically a bastion for violence and debauchery. The writers made it seem like we were going to be going up against a pantheon of mad men.   Then, they all become sympathetic villains… even Odin. Unlike ‘18, this game is filled with one sappy event after another. Thor has a sweet family, he changes his mind in the end. Greta fully forgives Kratos. Midgardians take in Thors family. Freya even forgives Odin in the end… I guess they didn’t want to do GoW 3 all over again (even though they built up that story in ‘18).  I’m just so incredibly disappointed with how they went with it. I thought it was such a lousy dynamic. Everyone was kind of a good guy. It felt like there were no stakes at all. I know Atreus is Loki, but it just felt so out of place for him to come and go from Asgard as he pleased.  It all felt so PG too, which is fucking insane to me because this is Kratos we’re talking about… not saying he needed to be a bloodthirsty maniac, but SOMEBODY did! It was just one harmless character after the next. I got so incredibly bored halfway through, but I was holding out hope that Odin was going to kidnap Atreus and Kratos would have to go psycho to get him back. So something would happen.   But we just got this sappy ass lukewarm story the entire way through. I’m so depressed.",

If I can't do it immediately, then I play against the table with the one card draw shenanigans. I have low cost creatures to help me win after the Worldfire if necessary.   Starting with getting Tevesh out for the card draw and the possibility of doing the ultimate ability. I only cast Jeska after the Worldfire.   I don't have any swamps to avoid getting stuck after a worldfire. The Black mana I need usually either comes from treasures or dual lands (and the once in a while Phyrexian Altar).  I would like to make the deck faster and more reliable. Any thoughts or ideas are more than welcome. Thanks!",

    "title": "Suggestions from a returning player",
    "self_text": "The game is becoming stale   I believe that after a few wipes there is very little content in the game to keep me interested. Battlestate Games have tackled this by implementing wipes and daily quests which are good addition to this, but not enough. For me, when I look back the most enjoyable aspect was learning the game, I believe that for the game to emulate this it would need to have major changes between wipes.  A few examples of this could be to change locations of: loot spawns, marked rooms, scav spawns, barter trades etc. Basically add some randomness that requires to relearn certain aspects of the game.  Also quests could change, instead of having the same quests Battlestate Games could create hundreds that alternate between each wipe. Or they could have a more personal approach and have a main theme or story each wipe which reflect on unique quests.  &#x200B;   Lobby for hackers   Hackers are clearly present in the game, which is natural due to the economic nature of the game. Although Battlestate Game has been doing a large amount of work to tackle them, they keep appearing. Clearly this approach doesn't seem to be working as the main problem is that the developers have to spend time dealing with hackers rather than adding content and improving the game.  The Cycle: Frontier, a looter shooter, has addressed the issue in a unique way. They use a system called trusted matchmaking, once a player becomes trusted they get matched to other trusted players. Cheaters are also pooled into their own lobbies. There are multiple factors that go into determining when you are trusted such as: numbers of hours played, lifetime of the steam account, stats in-game etc. Also if you get killed by a hacker the items you brought into the raid are returned back to you.  Although Battlestate Games may be hesitant to introduce any sort of \"matchmaking\" system, I believe this may be necessary to combat hackers.  &#x200B;   Reminders in main menu before joining raids   Currently if your health is low you when starting a raid you get a warning. I believe this is beneficial but should also be applied to other areas as well such as: low durability in armour, mags not filled, bags not empty, food and fluid is low.  I understand that EFT is a hardcore game and has little to no hand holding. However I don't believe forgetting to do something in the lobby is reflective of your in-game skill. Furthermore loading into a raid with the above negative effects detracts from the overall experience, it simply leaves you angry and frustrated. Games are primarily meant to be fun.  New players in particular are already having to learn a lot and will naturally forget some things, informing them of mistakes before they are made will increase player retention and enjoyment. Although I'm sure this also affects experienced players, the number of times I have died for forgetting to eat a drink is more than I can count over the course of several wipes.  &#x200B;   Filtering   The filtering in the game menu currently highlights items in set categories, however I don't think this is really helpful.  I believe instead a more useful approach would be to display an inventory with just the filtered items at the top, including anything in containers being brought out and shown.",

I read on wowhead that 'leveling progresses about 60-70% faster for 1-50, compared to the time it used to take to get from 1-120'.   When I used to play wow my favourite part was the questing, and even back in the old days I always found this went by so fast (I started questing in Outland at lvl 60, but reached 80 by the time I completed it and then pwned everything in Northrend). I'm concerned that the level squish won't let me get the same enjoyment out of questing.   Do others (who enjoy questing, I know that isn't everyone lol) find that they are able to play through vanilla, then burning crusade, then wotlk, etc. at a steady pace since the level squish? Or do you just reach the next expansion at a very high level and lose all the challenge?  Sorry if this question has been asked before!",

    "self_text": "Shireen's name may be a clue in favor of the theory that she will be sacrificed to R'llor. I think there is some wordplay going on here.  Separated into the two syllables \"Shir\" and \"Reen\" the name can be read as \"Bright-Reborn\" using Old English (which George very commonly uses) and French.  >Shere or Shire is derived from the Old English \"scir\", meaning  \"fair, bright, shining\" .  >René meaning  born again or reborn  in French is derived from the Latin name Renatus.  Why think French? Because the name Shireen or \"Shereen\" is also a French name from the word \"chéri\"  (Listen to Google translate French to English say chéri. The pronunciation is almost exactly the same) . Also George likes French and the history of France as he motioned when discussing the book  Les Rois Maudits  which was an inspiration for ASOIAF.  This reading of the name very closely matches the language used when a follower of R'llor discusses fire sacrifice or death.  >\"Let these girls be reborn in light. - Victarion  >Better that they be reborn into the light.\" - Selyse   The name \"Shireen\" is a play on words.  Within the \"darling\" Shireen or \"chérie\"  hides a more sinister meaning related to R'llor worship.",

If the villain has almost killed the hero, they won't finish him off because its beneath them. Whenever the hero almost kills the villain, they won't finish him off because reasons.    These people have more blood to spare per person than a hospital which received an infeted batch of donations. Everyone's always bleeding like a faucet but no worries bro, I have will power    Physics:   As long as there's funny music, all injuries are minor, including getting kicked in the head, having a brick drop on your head, or falling down a deep hole. Funny music = immortality + its a joke bro  People jumping around on buildings and trees like they're in Naruto, but during a fight they're suddenly restricted  When the fuck did they all gain the ability to fly while fighting? Why would anyone walk after they realized they can fly??   Characters if they were real people:   Ichigo: In jail for domestic abuse, cellmate is his dad  Inoue: Conjugal visits to Ichigo  The eyepatch captain that Ichigo beat: Running an underground fight club  Ishida: Class topper with a side hobby of building chemical weapons   All in all, 8/10 show.

    "self_text": "Hello Redditors! Very,  very  funny story happened today. Well, not for me, but that's not the point.  &nbsp;  It had been a beautiful morning of Eight of November. A young, yet aspiring man hath riseth from his bed, waddled to his seat, and henceforth the story fully began. He awoke his computer from sleep as always, and frittered away the time. Seconds felt like pure blissful eons, as he scrolled through the endless internet. He decided to start a long dead game called Evolve, and start it he did, indeed. 10 minutes into a thousandth match of his life, his PC  suddenly   shut down . This has happened before.     \"A power outage it must've been!\"  , - he thinks to himself. But, as swiftly as he came to that conclusion, he just as quickly noticed the contradiction in front of him, as well as above him. Ceiling lights remained on, and router remained on as well. By this time - the computer has already started turning itself back on. He waits 15 seconds for the splash image to arrive - but it never does. So, he resets the computer. Still nothing.  Coincidentally, he notices that the mouse and keyboard lights aren't coming on either, so he grabs his pluggable USB voltage meter and plugs it into his USB ports - it reads 3.5V. 1.5V lower than intended. Instantly, frightened of data loss, he turns off the computer and removes all drives. Then, he grabs his voltmeter and measures 12V, 5V and 3.3V rails of the PSU. He reads 9.5V, 3.5V and 2.7V. All lower. Not good. He thinks it's a bad PSU when he notices that his motherboard has LED debugging LEDs. He reads what the LED says - the \"CPU FAULT\" LED is on. What could it be?   The introduction has been pretty simple so far.   Sudden shutdown  Won't post, but fans spin  Low voltage on all rails, but...  IS IT?   the story continues     He decides to remove the GPU as well, to prevent the damage to it, as he remembers the GPU has very sensitive MOSFETs that operate in a specific voltage saturation region and low voltage could kill them. Besides, the computer has integrated graphics, so that's not a problem.  &nbsp;  Correcting steps, commence!  &nbsp;    With only PSU, Motherboard, RAM and CPU remaining in the case, he decides to clear the BIOS via BIOS jumper as well as remove the BIOS battery for 30 minutes. He does it, no change.    He decides to shuffle ram, no change.    Voltage gets measured again, and this time..  SURPRISE!  Voltages are good and within spec! 12V, 4.98V and 3.3V!    He decides to take out PSU completely and to the paperclip test - it works great! So..  is it not the psu after all?      What do we know so far?   Voltages seem to be fine now  Still no post  Paperclip PSU test works ok   What happened next?    Stupidest moment of the story begins!   Next loical step in diagnostic would be reseating the CPU, possibly a new one and trying a second motherboard. As motherboards are more expensive than cheapest compatible CPU, he decides to get a CPU. However, the seller said it will have to wait until tomorrow, so he grows impatient. He searches the internet a bit about the problem a Youtube video about an user facing the exact same issue and solving it! And the comment section is FULL or positive replies. So he decides to try it!  &nbsp;   How is it done?   Simple, turn on your PC that won't post, and then quickly shift your ON/OFF switch on the PSU back and forth, quickly as in crazy fast.  I did that once, nothing happened. Second time, nothing. I guessed I was too slow. Third time I'll try it super fast, I thought to myself. So I do it and - woo! Power outage for real!! Wait - that's my breakers popping. Wait hold on did my PSU just blo-----.   Yes.    Yes it did.    So all in all my beloved Redditors, now I'm stuck with a dead PSU and either a dead motherboard or CPU. I'm out of ideas or any thoughts at all, so I hoped that you'd have something to share in the comments.  &nbsp;  Thanks for reading, love you all.",

    "self_text": "Hi, I've been lurking here for some time and I often see people with really good ideas for their colonies stories, and other that would like to try something new. I've seen people with 400%+ age growth for a multi generational colony, a mad mechanitor trying to clone her dead daughter and much, much more. So let's share ideas and be inspired by others !  I'll start : I've started with a goody two shoes rich explorer named Huabuka, with a wholesome ideologion. Everything was nice and all, up until the archonexus quest. Huabuka wanted the Archonexus. She had given up her colony for the first part of the map, and arrived to a new, barren place. She researched the monument, but soon realised she needed more funds, so she enslaved raiders and built tons of clothing and managed, after some years, to get her hands on the second part of the map. But it wasn't enough, and going more and more against her ideologion, she attacked allied caravans, enslaved as much people as she could and began an enormous flake farm to finance her research. Her longtime friends and husband were against it, but her speaking talent got her free from them rebelling. And flake. Tons of it. When she got the last part, she burnt everything to the ground, killed all the slave and when to the final Archonexus monolith. After a tough battle, and blinded by greed, she killed her last standing companions and took it all for herself. Would this downward spiral from her convictions, aggravating her mood, enslaving innocent and killing everybody really worth it? Only she can tell, but she isn't there any more to tell us.   TL;DR  : a kind person with a charitable ideologion turned to slowly to madness, slavery, drugs and murder to fulfil her craving for mysteries  No need for special mods for this story :)",

One of the things I liked about 1 and 2 was how vibrant and fun they were, despite the series stakes in both games, it truly felt like Bayonetta wasn't taking things  too  seriously and was genuinely having a good time, which served well to contrast the more serious moments when she did actually take things a little more seriously. By contrast, Bayonetta's attitude felt almost forced in this game and I only felt that whimsical fun in during the intro but with the apocalyptic backdrop (the other games had bright and sunny stages to contrast the literal hellscapes, something sorely lacking in Bayo 3) and constant death/destruction, the overall mood of the game was bleak, leaving Bayonetta's sassy quips falling flat.  Discussion of the story and gameplay has been done to death so I won't say anything on that, now that I've beaten the game the drastic tonal shift had me kinda bummed and I wanted to vent.",

As nice as they are, my Series X is reduced to a space heater if I don’t have internet (game share with the gf, I know it’s my own decision to do that but still) and I know buying games through Valve is just as much of a “license to play” rather than actually owning something as any other digital storefront. I also just plainly don’t like digital purchases. Physical media is for me.   Things of this nature just really nag at me sometimes. They’re my games, dammit! If there’s a title out there I  truly  want to  own , I’ll usually track it down on the oldest console it’s available for. I collect a lot of PS3 games for this reason, and am about to begin grabbing some PS4 games I’m interested in too because I know neither of those systems are reliant on internet to just play things, and in the PS3’s case it’s easily jailbroken for even further preservation.

    "title": "How to find an accidentally hucked weapon?",
    "self_text": "So last night I was building an outpost on the pavers bordering the upper yard. I went to relocate one of the storage chests when I accidentally hit the very ridiculously defaulted key to throw a weapon. It was a level 9 toenail scimitar. Sadly I was facing the koi pond and the thing flew off the edge of the paver and down into oblivion.   I spent over 45 minutes scouring the pond surface and depths where I estimated the weapon would have gone but to no avail. As I have upgraded my other weapons to high levels I don’t have any supreme whetstones left to get another one back to level 9.   I found that weapons sink in water but all searches came up empty. I know that dropped or thrown weapons have a proximity icon when you get close to them but that doesn’t always work. Why it doesn’t work is beyond me and clearly is not working as intended as I’ve lost arrows and other hucked items in the past but miraculously picked them back up by running over where they just happened to land but a weapon like this may as well be a needle in a haystack to find in the koi pond provided that’s where it is in the first place.   Will this weapon eventually despawn or will it be somewhere in the world waiting for me to find it by chance?  Here’s an idea for the devs: Make an item that was thrown ALWAYS show up on the HUD regardless of how far you are from it!!!!  While I know that you can remap the keys I would love to know who in the hell thought it was a great idea to default the huck key to R???",

With the help of House Light and the assistance of Empress Caitl, we have rebuilt the original Tower/expanded the current Tower. Happy Lightfall.\" Even if we don't get this, I'd love to see more passive and active NPC representation.  Since the City Faction leaders have been gone, the Bazaar is an empty space with Ikora Rey and Hawthorne. It'd be great to have Cabal and Eliksni NPCs filling this space, even if as passive denizens. We have some Eliksni down by the Annex vending machine and drop-point, but as of now Eliksni have joined the Vanguard's tower defense forces thanks to the community event. Hopefully we see more of them around.  This feels like a great opportunity to have NPCs like Mithrax or Lord Saladin/Valus Forge representing our allies, even if just standing there with passive dialogue.  During Seasons of the Chosen and Splicer (maybe Hunt, too?), Osiris was a non-interactable NPC wandering near Ikora by the storage boxes and giving commentary.  Eris Morn is technically stationed on the Moon, but in lore she returns often to speak with Ikora as one of her Hidden. Every few hours it would be cool to see her wandering the Bazaar or down by the Drifter. Doesn't she have a laboratory space where Savathun's corpse is on an autopsy table?  Ana Bray is \"technically\" in the Tower studying the Rasputin engram with Caitl's Psions, but I don't think we have her physically present anywhere in the current Tower. That's a shame!  A passive dialogue Eido would likely be a treat, commenting on all sorts of human things.  &#x200B;  We already have this kind of thing happening in the HELM, where Crow is standing there but only does anything when specific parts of the current plot call for it.  Some small changes like this could really upgrade the Tower ambience and fill in some of the barren spaces we have now that a bunch of the old exotic quest content and secrets were sunset.",

Story time: the DM was giving us the history of the town we were going to though a ranger we met on the road. About halfway into the history I ask if I can pull a fish out of the bag. He says sure and I rolled a nat20. He describes how I pull out a 5 foot long dog shark. Which I then proceeded to stroke like a cat periodically dunking it in the bag so it can breathe. About an hour later we are at a wizards tower and I have a great idea:  Me: “hey dm, if I roll at nat1 in religion can this dog shark evolve to have wings and breathe air because Christians don’t believe in evolution?”  Other players: “Pls allow it”  Dm: “you know what, sure why not”   I roll BOOM nat1. Ladies and gentlemen I introduce Spot the Flying dog shark.  It was a lot of fun. Spot sadly died to save another player by body blocking.

I know, that I've mentioned the big three in the title. However, this question in my opinion applies to all of the shows that became mainstream hits during the late 90s, early 2000s.  Was it the fact that those shows had plenty of episodes compared to other shows, especially coming out after or during the OVA craze of the 80s and 90s?  Or were they just better marketed and thus managed to reach the masses?  Or was it merely a coincidence, simply because they were aired at the perfect time for kids to watch after coming home from school?  Did they do anything so spectacularly different from other (western) shows that were airing at the time?  And most importantly, why have other (modern) Anime failed to replicate this success. Sure, we have new titles that are extremely successful like MHA, AoT or recently Chainsaw Man. But I'd argue that they are nowhere near as popular, especially outside of the Anime fandom.  What do you guys think? I would love to hear your thoughts on the matter.",

Her parents live in Japan, and it was a whole ordeal, and I am so grateful for all of them and their efforts - the watch is an absolute marvel.   The only issue is the band.  It was the largest size band that Japan had to offer, but my arm size is just a little bit bigger.  I  went to a watch dealer a couple of years back to re-band it, but the band he put on wasn't a perfect fit, and one of the clasps broke in the process.  What I want is, an original replacement clasp (that is, the little trapezoidal piece that connects the band to the watch, itself), as well as a few original links (5 should do it), for it to be able to fit my arm.  I'd love nothing more than to wear this all the time.  I've already contacted SEIKO and they were not much help, saying that the watch was a limited edition, and used a specific band that is virtually impossible to get parts for.  There are some bands I've found that  may  work, but it is my absolute preference to just extend the length of the original.  So, I'm hoping to source the parts from here, as a last resort.  I'd also be willing to pay for shipment and the parts, themselves.  Just...anything short of buying a second watch would be excellent.  Thank you guys for any help you can offer.",

After that, the ennemy player started his turn, did not shoot, declared a charge, so I used overwatch, and we agreed that rapid fire also applied, so 10 shots again   Is our interpretation of that correct, or does rapid fire not count when doing overwatch ?",

As people got better building it made me practice and refine my building too which made it really fun.   &#x200B;  With the introduction of no build I thought like it was fun since it went back to the pubg style BR that most games follow but it just didn't feel like fortnite. It actually feels way too easy. I know people enjoy it but it makes the game really bland and predictable. All I do is run around and kill whoever I see without the engagement of trying to out build the other person. Even though it was fun at the beginning I think the no build game mode is just a way of appealing to the players that can't build and don't have the dedication or hands to learn how.   &#x200B;  That was my little rant.   &#x200B;  TLDR: no build is skill less and outdated.

It seems Arven always carries a copy of one of the books with him.  📷📷  Photographs and sketches of unidentified creatures fill the pages of the Scarlet Book and Violet Book. While there have been sightings of similar creatures in recent years, such reports are rare, and specific details of the creatures’ biology are still a mystery.  📷📷📷  The Monster Known as Great Tusk  The book describes how this savage monster attacked the expedition team with its large body and tusks, mortally wounding one of the explorers.  📷  The Monster Known as Iron Treads  It is said that when this monster curls its body and rolls to attack, it leaves a trail gouged into the ground, as if it had scorched the earth.

    "title": "This Movie made me dislike Shanks",
    "self_text": "I must say that whether you liked the film, Uta or not, I felt the whole story was super forced. Before anyone says anything to me, UTA'S MOTIVATIONS AT AN EMOTIONAL LEVEL ARE UNDERSTANDING, I mean at the story/event level:  Uta doesn't seem to have lived 7 years of her life as a pirate: A girl who doesn't like to get dirty, who loves jewellery, who is characteristically naive and spoiled... Was she brought up by a gang of drunken pirates who dress like they bathe once a week and canonically plunder ships? Even their treatment of music doesn't fit, how pirates who sing Bink's Sake end up with a mini diva, who they fawn over like a goddess when she is a 9 year old girl who never had any musical education? Even in extra material she doesn't seem to know that BM is a pirate or that what is a bounty! (Uta's Diary)  Shanks is a shitty father in every way:  The reasons for abandoning Uta while understandable in context do not justify his actions, why blame you for genocide when there is a literal demon you could blame? Why not say that anyone released the demon or that a third party did it?  Why leave her with a stranger instead of leaving her with some powerful ally who could protect her or Luffy? Considering what happened with Ace, leaving Uta (the daughter of an emperor) on her own puts her in more danger than being a pirate and innocent people as well.   Didn't anyone think that leaving Uta to study to be a singer would put her in the global public eye and only bring more trouble because it would attract unwanted people who would seek her out for her DF?   Why leave your daughter, who is the only person capable of freeing a demon on the island where that demon is?   Why did Shanks never want to meet Uta again to explain the truth or at least see if she was okay once she was an adult?  Why did Shanks forget about his daughter, especially once he became emperor and had the means to protect her better than anyone else in the world both from herself and the world?  Uta could be used to get to him, even Elegy could be attacked and she could hurt innocents again in seeking to defend herself, the responsible thing would be to take Uta and prepare her to know the truth someday and be able to bear the responsibility of her power, not abandon a traumatized super-powered child to her fate and never return. But this theme is never explored, he tries to justify Shanks but Uta has worthy reasons not to forgive her father, which is a pity because this event could make Shanks more human.  Shanks is worse off if the film is not canon:  because it means that Uta was forgotten by his father and is still isolated on her island or died at some point without any closure to his conflict, but we will never get any kind of reflection or drama from Shanks about it because the film exists and Uta will never be relevant again. This is made worse when you consider that Shanks is patronised as a protector of the younger generation when the only one he cares about is Luffy. (Ch. 1055)  Suicide: they spend the whole movie trying to sell that Shanks loves her. Maybe it's just my opinion on this, but if your child doesn't want to live (commit suicide), you don't let her act on it, especially if she wants to escape reality. Letting an extremely unstable girl (drugged) suicide with her own father allowed it. The worst thing is that the justification is poor, Uta needs to sing or die to free everyone? it contradicts what was previously established by her powers and comes out of nowhere, how does Uta know that?  Extra: A good plan   ⁠Tor music attacks  ⁠Shanks beats him, uta asleep  ⁠Gordon explains the situation  ⁠Shanks takes Uta and Gordon on his boat  ⁠Uta wakes up  ⁠Everyone tells her that an earthquake destroyed the island /or that Tot musica destroyed the island but they say they don't know what the demon was.   ⁠Shanks convinces Uta that she is not pirate material and that she would be happier being a singer, besides that being her daughter could bring her problems if she becomes famous.  ⁠They leave Gordon and Uta on an island, it could be in Fusha, so she could grow up with Luffy  ⁠Shanks leaves but on good terms and with a Uta without trauma (They could still see each other occasionally or talk on Den Den/write letters to each other)  Give me a plot hole in this plan   Or left Gordon somewhere and continue with their life’s normally",

Now I know the point of the game is \"explore, explore, explore\" and trust me I am getting my fun from that...but I really wish there was a point to getting better tools and ships or that some form of even an optional final boss or challenge existed. Either a true final confrontation with sentinels or something akin to a gauntlet that tests our resourcefulness maybe.  I don't know. I've just sunk in 90 hours into the game doing the tasks presented to me in the general gameplay and defintiely have had my fun, but without something to really \"test\" my resources and upgraded on, the end game if you will feels pretty hollow. I feel like I need to sit on my hands and wait for one of HG's next major updates for something like thus, but it looks like that isn't a direction we're going.  Just some of my thoughts.

I want to use the ship for racing ofc but I like my ships to be used in other scenarios too like why not a bit of pvp or other things.  And that’s why I cannot choose the best razor for me 😅  I know the LX is the fastest and is as maneuverable as the other right now ( I think it is not intended because of the description of this ship) but it lacks some poolhp (2900hp) whereas the others got more (9000hp).  The EX version is “stealth” at least it is intended in the future but will not be as maneuverable as the Razor original. But the stealth part can be a good point for him  And now the original Razor is good but I cannot see the advantage of it ? It’s maybe a good compromise between the two variants I don’t know 🤷🏻‍♂️   So, I’d you guys could give me some advises on which one could be the perfect fit for me I will be happy Ahaha  See you o7",

    "self_text": "SPOILER ALERT     SPOILER ALERT    I want to start by saying that I think the game is a masterpiece visually. The art direction is out of this world, and the gameplay coming straight from GOW2018 means the actual gameplay is great too (if not a bit too overly familiar). The side content of climbing the living tortoise in Svartlfeim and releasing the giant Jellyfish in Alfeim for instance were also amazing.  I am however profoundly disappointed in the main story, writing and boss fights. The story never came anywhere close to moments like rediscovering the blades of chaos, undoing Kraros’ arm bandages atop the highest peak in Jotunheim, or stepping into the Light beam in Alfeim in GOW2018.   •Odin killing Thor is lazy writing.   •Artreus destroying the mask for no reason is lazy writing (he spends the entire game seeking answers. Why not just use the mask after dealing with Odin? Because that would require actually thinking up something compelling to be inside the crack in the first place. The plot point went absolutely nowhere).   •Sif/Thrud radically going 180 and turning against Odin despite us murdering her own children is lazy writing  •Freya deciding to team up with Kratos again for no reason out of nowhere after the disguised Valkyrie fight was lazy writing.   •There’s even the token sacrifice of a character scene that’s supposed to feel emotional but because they were never developed even remotely we don’t care at all (the dude with the beard and the big sword who jumps off the boat after saving Freyr). And then there’s a stupid needless sacrifice scene where Freyr sacrifices himself FOR ABSOLUTELY NO REASON. It’s just very bad writing.   •And there’s more examples than I can cite  Second, the boss fights for Odin and Thor are so forgettable. This is Ragnarok! God of War 3 12 years ago did an apocalypse better than this. This should have been an truly epic fight like we had against Poseidon or Zeus. It just seemed so lazy. So rushed.  I do not know how on earth you could play this game and call it a 10/10. The perfect game! Games journalism is a joke. Wtf even is IGN",

What could have done is that they could add extra few lines during the twist scene with Uta saying she has no right to hate pirates, but she had to keep going because there already way too many fans listening her fans and cries about their suffering because of the pirates, and she couldn't let her fans down, or add the scene where Shanks (or Luffy) asks her why she did it and Uta responds by saying after she realized the truth, she has been consumed with so much guilt that she believed she didn't deserved to be loved, but she has to keep going as \"Pirate-hating Uta\" because there way too much fans who follows her and she doesn't wanted to let them down. And admitting that she initiated new genesis plan as the mean for atonement for what she did as well as she wanted to see Shanks one last time.

    "self_text": "Hi all,  I'll be honest, I don't game properly much - I'm super busy, but when I can, I really enjoy the gaming I can fit in. I'm a hardcore starcraft: brood war fan, and enjoyed SCII when I had time for it. I'm far more likely to play mobile games here and there, broadly in the RTS genre, with some games leaning more toward factory building, others a lot like Stellaris. When my city was locked down for COVID, I bought Anno 1800, and really enjoyed that too. Next on my list of recommendations was Stellaris, and I have to admit - it doesn't seem that fun.   I see a handful of elements which make for interesting gameplay, and a rich depth of possibilities to explore (particularly with all the DLC), but I'm just not particularly enticed by the central premises to bother continuing to dig.  Am I missing something with this game, or is it just not for me? I've got plenty more on my list of games to check out, but before I go buy something else, it's there anything I should check out first in Stellaris? I know the purchase price is probably nothing to serious gamers, but I feel like this really wasn't worth the investment.  Apologies if this seems like trolling, I'm honestly looking for suggestions.",

It had different orcs that could grow with you and become leaders. And any time an orc beat you, he promoted. It is a neat idea if you have never tried it check it out.  Anyways, I think this would work GREAT for a pokemon game. Either a main title or a legends game could us this. If a trainer beats you, they promote. Maybe to gym leader or maybe to one of the trainers inside the gym. The gyms and trainers around you would always change. It would make the worlds feel so much more real and dynamic.

Is this a tool tip aura mix-up from the devs or does mechs not count as allies?  Second I tried making a Mech obsessed craftsmen guild with production specialists. But since they can't haul this causes a lot of not only non-existent synergy. But is actually damaging. Shooting specialists had (and have) the same issue of not being able to craft too. But for roleplaying I decided to suffer through assigning and reassigning them.  It seems none of the specialists, even the leader's combat command, does anything.  It's kinda sad to see that you can't hyper specialize specialists further into mechinators.  Posted this as feedback (in hopes for change). And as a PSA so people who are into roleplaying don't fall into the same traps as me thinking this would be cool thematically and interesting from a gameplay standpoint.  It really sucks but specialists don't have any good combos to offer as mechinators.",

    "self_text": "So I was thinking, what if Cypher’s cams could show enemy abilities? Like how you can normally check how many abilities your teammates have. It could be every time you stick someone you also catch a glimpse of their ability count. It would also be helpful on making Cypher’s ult a little more rewarding if it could show their abilities for a few seconds.  I am fully aware that this is near useless but it would be pretty cool considering Cypher’s character. Also it would make him a little more relevant in early rounds and late in the round if you can deduce what your opponent has. Like if you know the enemy is out of flashes or something, it makes dueling a little easier or if you know that a sage hasn’t used their heal so you go for body shots.  The info although little can be beneficial in a match and I believe it would be a very much appreciated buff to a character not a lot of people use.   Plus it really fits his whole intelligence gathering schtick. Wouldn’t it make sense that he knows a something a bit more than what initiators already fo 10 times better for free?  What are your thoughts?",

Just want to share how fun this game has been playing lots of songs and buffs for different players, if you haven't already, you should try!  Yesterday I played songs in the middle of a big PvP war happening in one of the starting areas and it was so funny watching people attack each other while I'm standing there playing the drums lol.  Hope everyone is enjoying the game.  Yum Espresso :))",

    "self_text": "I resubscribed today after playing the free weekend last week, I haven't played since the start of BFA but I levelled a warrior up to 60 through the pre patch event today and on that weekend, which involved taking a short quest chain that started from Ebyssian and ended with farming the event.  My issue is from what I understand there is a quest that is meant to be available that sends you to the Uldaman:Legacy of Tyr dungeon and gives you weapons as a reward (which I want for transmog) but I can't find that quest anywhere? The dungeon is available to queue in the dungeon finder but nowhere in Orgrimmar or the tower outside Durotar where you get the daily primal essences has the quest available. Anyone else had this issue?",

    "self_text": "Screw, performance, graphics and bugs - my by far biggest problem with SV are the lack of clothing options. The character customization is so good and the models look great, but the the fact that you’re stuck with these four ugly ass academy uniforms is so bothersome. This isn’t what I expected, when they said that they removed gender-locked clothing. They removed clothing entirely. All they did was make four male uniforms and make girls wear it to. So many hair colors clash heavily with these outfits and you can’t make them look good.  How could they make such good improvements to the facial customization, yet remove clothing options entirely?  I’ve had a pretty good time with Scarlet so far, but I can’t look at this ugly ass uniform for much longer…  EDIT: Let me also add that the customization/shop experience is absolutely terrible. I don’t get why it’s 2022 and some games still display text rather than a preview image of the article of clothing. And having to wait like 4 seconds for the model to load after selecting a new article of clothing… It would literally be so easy to design a better interface for this, and like please just let me select an article and then show me the color variants, rather than displaying every color variation as it’s own article…",

    "title": "Some ideas i have been brain storming",
    "self_text": "A new elemental mod that spawns a elemental well when you drop a super (not the same as   SUPREME WELLMAKER  which is stasis only)  big topic: armor 3.0 should come one way or another and specifically should require some high expense to create 71 stat on seasonal specific armor with the ability to choose based only on the drops received. (will prob never happen but cant hurt to through it in)  A tip or a note i have noticed.  If you are using a melee super you are handicapping yourself. For both pvp and pve  (Not going into detail this is not a pvp rant).  I think every weapon found in the public should become craft-able after at least 2-3 seasons of it being out. as the weapon is a public drop that means it is a free to play drop (ive never been a free to play in destiny 2) but allowing free to play players the change to see the value of crafting would be nice (yes i know kingsfall is also free to play and free to play players can craft those weapons but a lot of free to play players do not touch raids at all). I would finally be able to get my perfected funnelweb.  Getting thruster on arc was an amazing experience i have wanted a dodge on my titan for years but i would really like it if i could get it on my other classes also even if the time for them is doubled heck even tripled i would happily wait 45 seconds for a dodge on my solar titan at 100 Resilience it is worth it and if your a titan and you dont like it you can always use something else. I assume Warlocks would like the same for Icarus dash minus the time part, i cant speak for them in that part. (prob wont happen but it doesn't hurt to ask)  Can warlock healing greande grant X2 restoration for like 10 sec minimum. like they are the healing /support class if anyone should get x2 restoration for that long it should be them. on the note if sunspot doesn't grant x2 restoration then can their original damage and ability restoration be brought back to what it was pre witch queen. essentially give it Radiant on activation only and in the background its ability regen should be brought back in line with wat it was.   we should have mayhem strikes. because why not. (and no it wont break the game)  A super improvement would be for all supers to get the chaos reach capability of being turned on and off. this would allow time based supers to not go to waste such as well or bubble, which would mean that when its like 15 seconds remaining you can pull it back but after 14 seconds their would be diminishing returns, while roaming supers could be based on how many kills before deactivation for example after 1 kill the maximum you can refund if you stop super would be like 70% , after 2 kills 60% and so on and on. but this wont work for any shutdown super as they are roaming damage (titan missiles once you start you have to either run out of super or hit something)  Last suggestion bungie needs to allow certain abilities to work while in super for example while on arc titan the juggernaut shield does not work while in super, the thruster ability still uses it recharge time. it should have an unlimited spam while in super like every other class can do with their dodge ability while in super. like dawnblade and arcstridder. This is right their at the bottom for 1 of the worst melee supers in the game it ties with shield bash which has its own problem which is not that big of a deal but if you try to use an overshield from the barricade while in super you wont get a shield.  &#x200B;  Thats it lots of other suggestion bungie has already taken them and are adding them to game such as crafting, raid matchmaking, loadout in the game, increase of vault space I believe its 100 ever 2 seasons, new pvp maps, pvp ranking system. Its good to know that bungie is listening and they are really making a lot of additions an improvement into the game while still giving us quality season story lines and content. to me this is a great time to be a destiny 2 player (content draught at the end of the season just means take a break and get ready for another amazing season.)",

Me personally I dont like Elden Ring but I get why people like it.  But I strongly disagree that the same amount of love and care and professional work was put down into Elden Ring as they did with God of War. That is why God of War should win game of the year, end of story.  My personal opinion is that IF Elden Ring wins it is NOT because it deserves it, it is because it has a wider range of players. It is because X-Box players and PC players also voted for it and that is not fair.  So if you are an Elden Ring fanboy, I am sorry if this post hurts your feelings but I think that the best work done on a game should win the prize and at this moment God of War is by far the superior here.",

The gameplay feels simplistic, but the added shooter mechanics can make it enjoyable despite it's limited options. Cons: This is basically an early access MMO. There's a huge lack of content, missions are as generic as they can be, with the principal theme being walk from A to B, repeat. The PVE suffers from a lack of mechanics, it's as simple as it gets, with most mobs being just bullet sponges that don't push you into learning anything. PVP wise, i was attracted to the idea of \"open world pvp\" but it just isn't. You basically get a bind to turn PVP mode on or off, with most of the population prefering the latter with the exception of those that reached the cap to both level(60) and gearscore (625) one shotting the random unfortunate low lvl player. In regards to farming, it's a disappointment, there's no reason to learn any trade till you are max level, because you'll level up faster than you can grind any trade, and you'll get most drops that you need from random enemies either way, or the auction house. So really it's just an endgame extra labor for those of you that wanna have an edge in the PVP scenario. Finally, i wanna say this game feels very casual (lack of mechanics to learn) and boring. If it didn't look as good as it did none would play it, it's a walking simulator with no mounts, were you'll spend most of your hours running and grinding, never needing to learn anything more than what you did past the first 10 hours.",
