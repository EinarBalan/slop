One of the main reasons I went for my assessment was because of how badly it impacted my undergraduate. I am currently doing my masters & already struggling - which is why I am going for this appointment.   I just don’t really know what kind of support I can ask for? they asked how do I think they can help, so what they offer, I’m guessing, will be based on what I say I struggle with at uni  Obviously I don’t want to ask for things that won’t actually help.   At the same time, does anyone have examples of things that their university or DSA assisted them with that made university more accessible for them.   I struggle with inattentive/hyperactive and impulsive & I know support is individual, but if I could get ideas of examples it would be helpful.  (I literally know nothing about the service because I didn’t even know this was a thing till my course director told me)",

It starts of slowly of course, arrays (and Numpy arrays) were quickly introduced. However I have a fundamental question about arrays.  This was one of the tasks (working with fictitious height & weight data)  # Print mean height (first column) avg = np.mean(np_baseball[:,0]) print(\"Average: \" + str(avg))   The coding itself is easy to understand, but I keep struggling with internalising the \"[:,0]\" bit. It is used to take out the first column of data, and do some analysis on that. But in my mind, \"[:,0]\" means to take the first row instead.  I see them as coordinates, which always follow the [x,y] formula. For me, the colon means to take everything from the first x value (so the data from the horizontal/row), with the 0 limiting it to the first row.  I hope that all made sense, because it is a fundamental problem for me right now. How am I wrong in my interpretation that arrays use the coordinate system the wrong way around? [0,:] for me means to stop on the first x value, and take everything from the y axis.",

Here’s how the conversation went:   (Also, the whole conversation was in sign language- it’s a deaf classroom- so while my teacher was in the room, her back was turned- she was busy talking to another staff person so she didn’t see the exchange).   Me: “What are you planning to write about?”   Him: “Ummm…you! (My name)”   Me: “That’s not appropriate. Find something else to write about.”   Him: …comments about me and pajamas…   Me: interrupting “No. Something else…for example,…”   Him: Interrupts and starts rapid firing questions about whether I have a girlfriend or boyfriend or am I married…   Me: “I won’t answer that.” (Glances around for my teacher and feeling unsure of what’s to do…first time dealing with this- she’s still busy and I can’t easily get her attention)…I then walk away signing “Absolutely not- find another topic” and focused on other students. Students who witnessed this joked that the male student should be spanked.   Should report this to the lead teacher and possibly administration?

I'd call that the onboarding phase. Since then I don't feel like I've gotten a deeper understanding of anything or come up with any innovative ideas. I feel like I plateaud very quickly. It could be my ability, my motivation, the management & start-up culture, or me having unrealistic expectations.  I haven't learned to build bigger things, just build the things I was building but at a slightly quicker pace. Basically, I feel like my growth & impact is linear/sublinear whereas I had expectations that it should be exponential (building bigger things rather than building quicker). My manager assures I'm doing good work, but they never give me concrete goals and I worry: 1) being disposable in the current economy 2) failing to improve myself for future jobs.  Are my expectations realistic? What is typical growth for 0-2 years?",

    "self_text": "TW: self harm   I am a 5th year in college who is non-traditional student aged. I was previously academically dismissed and worked so hard to get back into my college and I did! The community college classes I took in the time between was so easy and I didn’t really learn to cultivate better habits as I was able to quickly do work and still get As, which felt good, but not the same at a 4 year college. I have been diagnosed with ADHD/ anxiety/ depression since the 5th grade and didn’t start utilizing accommodations until high school. Used them and did great. College is another story as I started to having to advocate for myself and thought all of my negative symptoms were how everyone felt and who I was. I never saw those things as barriers, but as I have gotten older, the dots have started clicking. I have been embarrassed to use my accommodations until this year because past friends made comments that it’s unfair and I took those to heart. The academic resource center purged my files upon my dismissal so it’s been a mess trying to get the correct documentation and my doctor only sent in the documentation last week even though I was asking for months. I am very frustrated as I’ve been falling behind due to my mental health rapidly declining this semester upon starting a new medication that made everything worse: insomnia, more anxiety, not taking care of myself, thoughts of unaliving myself, and started c*tting myself for a few weeks. I started to make the connection that it was my new med I started and then cut it cold Turkey and have felt better, but I’m still in a disassociative state making functioning hard. I am scared to disclose all of this as I can’t afford to medically withdraw and am supposed to graduate in the spring. I would appreciate any advice for how to handle this",

    "self_text": "To preface, I recognize that this is a first-world problem. I went into this recruiting cycle thinking that as long as I got an offer, I'd be very happy. I already feel very grateful to have gotten the opportunity to interview and be thinking about this in the first place.  I had a Bloomberg offer deadline that was set pretty early. Was also in late stage for SWE intern at a trading firm. Three days before my deadline, another recruiter reached out to me for Citadel Launch, an internship program for sophomores.  Both recruiters knew of my deadline and asked me to get an extension since they couldn't expedite the process any further. The time I asked for an extension happened to be the time my Bloomberg recruiter was transitioning to another role. She said that she would put me in touch with my new recruiter, that she couldn't promise an extension but would forward the message along, and in the meantime, treat the deadline as the original.  I accepted the Bloomberg offer as the deadline approached, as I wanted to have a guarantee and hadn't heard much follow-up about the extension. Clearly, accepting offer = no extension  The recruiters asked me for news on the Bloomberg extension request. I didn't want to lie about my extension, also felt icky about reneging. Given the job market situation for CS internships, I'd rather not burn any bridges, especially since I'll be interviewing again next year and the year after. After learning more about the nature of the work, I've also become less certain that I'd enjoy HFT as a long-term career. I'm interested in trying, but not enough to outweigh the cost of reneging.  Among the offers I had, I narrowed it down to Bloomberg and two Big-Ns. My reason for leaning towards Bloomberg was that it would be a very different experience. I want to see more of the East Coast, as I grew up on the West Coast, previously interned at a Big-N, and think that the other two Big-Ns wouldn't be too different (both are either based in my hometown or near the place I was at last summer). I'm also curious to explore outside of pure tech companies and learn more about finance as a domain, including finance outside of trading.  Am I sacrificing career opportunities by making this decision? I'm fairly confident in my reasons, but a few people whose opinions I trust have asked me why not renege, or take the more well-known options. I'm willing to reconsider if it's worth it. Thank you!",

He's only been working a few months and is already making this much. I was looking at his account on LinkedIn and many of his coworkers have similar educational paths. He's also working remotely in a low cost of living area while the position is stationed in a high COL city in California.  I'd personally much prefer to do technical sales since there is a higher degree of personal interaction, and I am extroverted/competitive. The main reason I'm grinding leetcode and working in SWE is due to the salary. I would gladly take a minor dip in salary to be doing something like technical sales. I mean $170k is more than a many SWE's make. I did a bit of research on this subreddit but most of the posts are dated.  TLDR: Friend making $170k+ in technical sales after a few months of work.  Is it viable to transition to technical sales and get an MBA? Does anybody know how competitive this field is in terms of salary/positions compared to SWE?  Thanks for reading.  EDIT: for clarification, I have a new grad SWE job lined up in the summer. Pays decently. I'm just trying to see if there's something I could be more happy doing while also making more money.",
