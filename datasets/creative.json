I wake you up with a kiss and spend the entire weekend together, and listen to your beautiful voice talking about your day on our long late calls at the middle of the week  A universe where we concretize all of our plans, where we vague through the world as we always talked about, with our hands together, where I see a smile on your face and be certain that I'm the cause of it, as you were the cause of mine.  But then the alarm starts ringing. I wish I didn't woke up.",

It's like someone turned off the television and I can no longer see the movie. And sometimes, it doesn't come back. And, if I AM able to get the scene out, it lost all of its magic and integrity that made it so wonderful. Details go missing, I stumble on major and minor plot moments, etc. It's so frustrating! I have two amazing stories I'm  excited to write about but I'm scared I'm going to lose them. I even tried dictating my stories but it does the same thing.   Help!",

    "self_text": "Ok, so I think the earth is crumbling from beneath my feet. I am a big fanfiction reader and I feel like I've read every interesting fanfiction there is of the shows I care about. (I use ff and webnovel) I keep chasing for that feeling the rush of excitmenent I'd get when I find a good fanfiction, but I simply have not found any new ones that make me feel the same way. So I come here to beg you, please show me the way to your favorite fanfictions. About the tags I personally prefer, I like fics with kind mc, I have read too many villain/grey moral mc's recently, I like OC's maincharacters a lot, I like shows maincast interacting with MC. I like both serious and carefree stories but I don't think I've recently found any stories from worlds such as One Piece that stay true to the nature of the story which is pretty carefree (even tho it tackles some heavy subjects)  most of the time in these fanfictions they picture the world to be brutal and unforgiving, while the original work depicts very carefree picture most of the time.Feel free to comment any fanfiction you like. Even if I haven't watched/read the original work yet, at this point if the fanfic plot sounds interesting enough I think I will have to give them a try.  &#x200B;  Or is this the point where I am supposed to graduate from a reader to writer, never wrote my own fanfiction but I've been very interested in doing so, reading is my favourite pasttime after all so I might like creating it.  Anyways thank you for all the amazing works you have written up to this point they have made my life hell of a less boring.  [EDIT 1] Forgot to mention I pretty much love everything that is shounen, and I for reference one of my all time favorite fanfics is Percy Jackson and the World of magic by imjusttryingtofindmyway and The Spider by the same author ( minus the smut stuff not really my taste but I don't mind it I usually just skip the parts)",

Someone’s return.   Longing for recognition that I mattered to you and my attentiveness did not go unnoticed. I stare at the moon and admire its beauty. Others admire your eclipse for its rarity, yet I was there in admiration even when you were blue and waning. I illuminated your gloom to show you that even in darkness you are whole.   I hoped I was your wish. Someone whom you felt was enough. Yet, I was just a candle for you. Something of momentary use until you felt you did not need me for my light anymore.   I’m saddened by your approach and by you discarding me. I am deeply wounded by how replaceable I am. Yet this is a truth I have known all my life.  I tell my self that I am someone else’s wish.  To someone else I am a faint star.   Yet, a star no less.   -The sun",
