    "self_text": "Two weeks ago I went to the dentist. He had to fix and close a cavity. I was told that the operation was very urgent because the cavities were deep and I would have risked devitalizing the tooth.  The problem is that I think the dentist, while removing the cavities, went too deep and under covered/hit the nerve of the tooth. While operating I could feel that feeling of \"nakedness\" and pain, but I was not sure it was my nerve discovered. But the dentist didn’t say anything and proceeded to close my tooth. I have had an infernal pain in my tooth for two weeks now, it’s the same feeling as a dental abscess but without any noticeable swelling. I suppose the reason is the one I just described, but I don’t know if I’m right, or the dentist did everything in order and the pain is caused by some other problem of mine.  Now, I wanted to know if it is possible that a dentist could have made such a mistake without realizing it, what would be the consequences of such an action and what should I do to fix it?  &#x200B;  16, AFAB, no smoke, no alchol, 5'5, around 155 pounds, don't take any particular medication",

So 20 minutes of break = 5 seconds in real life  If you choose to sell the pill, you  can  make the pill very addictive. You can make a lot of money, but there is a 0.001% chance that the user gets trapped in the blank box for a very long time, scientist report that this amount of time is around 6 times the length of all of time itself. You know this is torture, but the amount of money is astounding, and the pill is sold under the same name as the company who first produced the pill, so there is no way of getting caught.  TLDR: earn lots of money off of an addictive pill you sell to others, but the pill can make you get trapped in your own head, for 6x the total length of time(not the length of time of the pill, the lengthbof all of time in the universe, so millions and billions of years of just yoyr consciousness).
