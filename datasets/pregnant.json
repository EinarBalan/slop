    "self_text": "I just need somewhere to write out my feelings. I have a severe case of the flu since Sunday. Think everything hurts, sweat attacks, chill attacks, the whole nine yards.  Today I visited my GP and she checked me out. We also listened to the baby‚Äôs heartbeat which was fine. But I didn‚Äôt feel her move until 10:30 which is super late for her. They scheduled me for an emergency ultrasound and it does seem that her movements are not as energetic as with the previous ones. I‚Äôm on bed rest and have another scheduled for tomorrow.  I‚Äôm absolutely terrified and constantly on the brink of tears of the thought of something happening to her, because I got a stupid flu. üò≠   The only silver lining is that I have a rockstar of a MIL who is taking care of my 1 year old and our dog. And she said she‚Äôll do it for as long as it‚Äôs needed.  P.S. my husband also has the flu. Otherwise he‚Äôd would take over childcare, which he did up until he got the flu last night.  Update: the baby is back on her regular kicking schedule with a vengeance üòÖ Kinda painful, but very relieved. With our first child we were contemplating taekwondo as a hobby, this one should definitely be kickboxing üòÇ",

I‚Äôm not close to my family and was hoping to only have my doula and one of my closest friends at the birth. My closest friends were also going to take turns staying with me for the first few weeks. I preferred my original plan because I know labour and the first few weeks can be hard and I wanted to surround myself with the people I feel comfortable being vulnerable with. Well my mom talked to my sister without consulting me and asked if she could come be with me at the birth and stay for a few weeks. My sister decided to take 7 weeks off work to come stay with me. She‚Äôs coming 2 weeks before my estimated due date and although I‚Äôm grateful and know that this is being done out of love, I feel sad that my original plan has been taken away from me.",

    "self_text": "I work at a small company who hasn‚Äôt had to deal with anyone going on maternity leave, therefore they do not have a set process. I am 7 months pregnant so I asked yesterday if my boss had discussed if any of my maternity leave is going to be paid assuming they would at least pay me part of my leave. (Keep in mind this is after they fully paid someone the whole time they were in rehab who makes double my salary). This prompted my boss to say she has never heard of paid maternity leave and has never experienced it in any of the companies she‚Äôs worked, which made me feel crazy. She also brought up how I said I would not be working from home during my maternity leave. So basically I just want to come on here and see how many of you that live in the US have partial or fully paid maternity leave, this can include having something in place like short term disability which my work also doesn‚Äôt have! This way when I talk to my boss about it again I can have a little more insight.",

    "self_text": "UPDATE: We had our results back today and was advised that we are now in low risk chance and the chances are 1 in 10,000. So happy to receive this news and happy to not proceed with further invasive testing.  I wanted to say thank you to each and everyone one of you who commented and shared your experiences.  Lots of love ‚ù§Ô∏è   Original post was:  Hey all. Currently growing baby #2 and we've just had our \"12 week\" scan.  Nothing was mentioned at our scan and everything with baby seemed to be perfect (to me, anyway) but with the NT measurement taken and my bloods, the screening test results came back as \"increased chance\" of baby having down syndrome.   We were advised it's a 1 in 42 chance, which I've been advised is 2 point something % chance.   Wasn't overly keen on having an amnio or CVS, so I opted for NIPT - which I had done yesterday and just waiting on the results. (Could take a week/just overüòî)  I've read a few posts on here regarding this and I'm also aware of r/NIPT... but I don't know if it's helping me or making me feel worse. I take everything with a pinch of salt anyway as I know everyone's circumstances are different.   They never told me if it was because of the NT measurement or if anything was amiss on the scan, they also never said it was down to my blood results, they just mentioned it was a combination of both, and including my age when baby is born (which would be 31)  My gut is telling me everything will be fine, trying to ride on that 97(ish)% chance that baby doesn't have down syndrome, and it's not about that so much, I just worry that there may be other defects.  I think I just feel a bit scared, and in limbo whilst we are waiting for the results.  Thanks all for reading.",

I‚Äôm losing my very short maternity leave, I‚Äôm so uncomfortable, I‚Äôm obviously getting inpatient but I don‚Äôt want this to sound like it‚Äôs just a patience thing - I‚Äôm riddled with anxiety abouty baby being okay. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it and truthfully I don‚Äôt even really feel like I‚Äôm going to get to bring my baby home, it‚Äôs just a weird anxious feeling that somethings is wrong.  Problem is, midwifery care doesn‚Äôt induce. They wait until you‚Äôre 42 weeks and then you‚Äôve termed out of care and I assume Is have to go to the hospital and beg for an induction.  Is there a way I can do that earlier? Will the hospital schedule an induction on someone they haven‚Äôt seen? I‚Äôm going crazy :(",

    "self_text": "Hi everyone, this is my first time posting. This is my second pregnancy. We had been trying for over 2 years to get pregnant again. I miscarried the first time during implantation 2 years ago. We didn't even know I was pregnant yet. According to my last cycle, I should be about 8 weeks, 4 days right now. I had an ultrasound on Thursday, Nov 4th and was informed that the gestational sac was still implanting and was scheduled for a follow up 2 and 1/2 weeks later for the 21st so we could see the baby. That Sunday before my scheduled ultrasound. We had to rush to the ER because I was bleeding. After they did the ultrasound, they said nothing was wrong, the baby was okay, and the bleeding was old implantation blood being expelled. They said I was measuring at 5 weeks 3 days but they said they were able to detect fetal heart tones. We went to our ultrasound appointment the next day on Nov 21st and we saw the baby. They said I was measuring at 6 weeks 3 days, and they were able to pick up fetal heart tones for about 2 seconds, (measuring at 138bpm) and then they said because of the baby's position, it was hard to hear. Everything was fine and normal until that Friday on Nov 25th (my birthday). I was bleeding again, and we went to the ER. We were told that I was having a miscarriage. The doctor said the gestational sac, the fetus, and the fetal pole were no longer visible, and there were no fetal heart tones detected. They said I would be having some cramping and bleeding over the next few days as my body starts to break down the \"reproductive material\". I was told to come back this past Monday, Nov 28th, to have my HCG levels checked again to make sure they were going down. I went back, they ran the tests, and my level went up by 4,056. They did another ultrasound and said that fetal heart tones still weren't being detected, but the fetus and gestational sac are growing. They said the blood and spotting were coming from a subchorionic hemorrhage, which increases possibility of a miscarriage but doesn't mean I'm having one. They said the baby, the gestational sac, and the fetal pole were clearly visible and I was measuring at 6 weeks 5 days with the gestational sac measuring 5mm, which was almost twice the size of what they said when we went to the ER on Sunday, Nov 20th. The doctor said there may be other factors for why they can't hear the heart tones. They said it may still be too early, it may be the position of the baby, or the blood could be in the way and could be interfering with them being able to hear the heart tones, but they're not sure and can't give me a definite answer yet, but they said the baby measuring right where it should be is a good sign. So instead of it being a definite miscarriage, it is a threatened miscarriage. I was told to come back Thursday for them to check my HCG levels again, and possibly do another ultrasound. They said in the meantime, I am on bed rest, and I should still operate as if I am pregnant. I haven't lost any pregnancy symptoms, I haven't had any bleeding since I was spotting on Monday. I haven't had any signs of miscarriage. I'm just confused and I'm so scared and worried. Is it possible for my baby to continue to grow and my levels to keep increasing if my baby is no longer alive??? I'm trying not to freak out and stress over it and just wait until I go back Thursday and wait until my OB appointment next week, but I wish there was a definite answer, and I wish I knew if my baby was okay. Has this happened to anyone else?? And if so, would anyone mind sharing their outcome??",

    "self_text": "Hope this is an okay place to post - just wondering what all you think about the positives of visitors at the hospital?   Genuinely asking. I‚Äôve read on here that a lot of parents do not want visitors at the hospital, and I am all on board for that. No, I don‚Äôt want a family reunion after i just gave birth and no Great Aunty Carah who I barely know cannot come either.   This is my 2nd pregnancy, and my first was born during a peak time of Covid. That was such a blessing cause we could use it as the ultimate excuse - only my husband allowed in the room with me and no visitors at all (no one had the vaxx at the time). People couldnt argue with me cause it wasnt my rules, it was the hospitals.   Now with baby #2 i feel like its shifting a bit with expectations. My mom (who is great, just needs a gentle reminder of boundaries sometimes) asked me if i would allow visitors after birth and i said no. She asked why and i said cause i don‚Äôt want it - dont want the family reunion, people can wait until we are comfy and back home. She starts going into how people would love to come visit me and the new baby and i say great, they can visit when we are home.   She threw in that its very usual for family members to come visit a new baby, and i said maybe it was the usual 30 years ago, but thats not really what i hear, and proceed to tell her that i hear lots of stories from my gals and friends of friends of people nowadays asking for no visitors at the hospital.   This seems so normal to me but maybe i am missing something? I‚Äôve made up my mind but I‚Äôm actually curious to people who think yes to visitors and why?",

    "title": "Graduated 38+1, breech, failed ECV, birth plan out the window and a sudden scheduled C section. Lots of detail and SO INCREDIBLY BEYOND POSITIVE.",
    "self_text": "So, to begin with - I had a very smooth pregnancy. Apart from morning sickness in first trimester and food aversions, everything was pretty textbook. My birth plan  was  a drug free, vaginal birth and everything was on track until our 36 week midwife appointment.  During my abdominal palpations, the midwife suspected baby was breech, it was then confirmed via ultrasound. In hindsight I think she was always breech and what I thought was her bum was her big ol' noggin all along! My midwife decided to book me in for an ECV and get me in for a growth ultrasound scan to see how she was growing and what position she was in. So we have the scan and the ultrasound tech is like \"uhh.. she's VERY small..\", concerningly small. She was measuring 3 weeks behind (2nd percentile). So we were of course in a panic. They make us wait in the waiting room for a doctor to give us the okay to even leave the building. He does. We then have to wait until the Friday (3 days later) for our doctors appointment. The doctor decides that they want to continue the plan of the ECV as although she is small she is in proportion which is a good sign, they book us for the ECV for the next Thursday. LONGEST WAIT OF MY LIFE.  We get to the hospital for the ECV and they have pop the monitor on to track her heart rate for an hour or so and then pop an IV catheter in for them to give me a drug to relax my uterus and help spin her around. The drug makes your heart race like crazy, I went from a resting 97 to a resting 157 within about 10 seconds. It made me feel super anxious but I was way too distracted by the actual spinning to pay any attention to my heartrate. I'm not going to lie, It hurt like hell. Everything I read said it would be 'uncomfortable' but it straight up hurt. She was frank breech with both feet by her head she was awkward. They tried to push her clockwise twice, but she would just pop back into place. The doctors even said that they could feel her almost popping into head down but she would just spring back. They then tried anti-clockwise once. Then her heart rate plummeted for a second, on the ultrasound we saw her heart stop for a minute and then pick back up. After that, the doctors didn‚Äôt want to continue any longer because it was too risky.  It was all super overwhelming and as soon as the midwife asked if I was okay I burst into tears because I was so overwhelmed and did not expect the massive wave of disappointment that hit me, but I came to terms with it pretty quickly - not that I had a choice.  Then we just had to wait for them to give us a c section date. They still wanted her out early because she's so small and she was officially classed as IUGR (intrauterine growth restricted) because they didn't know why she's so teeny.  So, we are then stuck in this terrible limbo waiting for the phone call with our C section date. They wanted me to go back in on the Monday for more fetal monitoring due to her heart rate drop. I was so anxious all weekend because if she went longer than 30 minutes without kicking I was certain she had died. I had never felt anxiety like that.  Monday (now 38 weeks) comes around and we go in for monitoring, we expected to be monitored for 30-60 minutes. It turned out to be three hours of monitoring and then they decide to do an ultrasound while I was there. A doctor takes me through to have my ultrasound and she takes A LOT of images, I become more panicked again. She then tells me that there is questionable blood flow to my placenta (Which was also hypercalcified) and that she is still really small and hadn't grown much since the last scan. She leaves to chat to the team and she comes back and says \"Yeah, we want you back tomorrow - we're getting her out.\". SUCH a shock, I think my partner and I went home in a daze. C SECTION DAY IS FINALLY HERE! We got in at 6:45am, fasted from midnight but could sip water until 6am. They popped us into our room and got me on an IV catheter and took all my obs. Because she was breech I also had a doctor come in and ultrasound and confirm she was still head up which she obviously was and I could feel her big ol' noggin in my ribs anyway so I knew. The anaesthetist came in and introduced himself and went through the procedure and the risks of the spinal block. They also discuss the option for a full general anaesthetic. Then they placed my urinary catheter, I was SO nervous for this. A lot of people said they will only place it post epidural but I actually had mine placed before any drugs. They get you to sit frog legged, like with your feet together and knees apart and then they just slide it in. Stung for like a second but nothing unbearable. When it was in it didn't hurt but was just a super weird, uncomfortable feeling. Like when you have a UTI and feel the constant urge to pee. We were originally first on the list but then got shuffled down because they schedule 3 c sections a day in this ward and the woman after me actually started to go into natural labour. She went in at 8:30am.  A bit after 10am, a midwife came through and took us up to pre operative. They gave my partner his outfit to get into - a gown, hat and booties to cover his shoes. We hung out there for like 15 minutes while they got the theatre cleaned and ready. The surgery nurses and doctors came back and introduced themselves (the ones I hadn't met anyway), The second anaesthetist came through and also introduced herself too and went through all the risks again with us. Then they took us through.  It's super overwhelming when you first go into the surgery room because there's SO MUCH STUFF IN THERE. Like all the monitoring equipment and tables and stuff for baby. And lots of people too. There's nurses for baby, two surgeons, anaesthetist and we also had specific baby doctors because of her size and her being breech. They also warned us that often when breech babies are delivered with c sections they come out stunned and don't cry - but not to panic because after a quick rub they usually get yelling. But that they would take her straight over to the monitoring bay to check her if this was the case.  So, They got me off of my prep bed and I sat on the edge of the surgery table with my feeties on a chair hugging a pillow. It was a little awkward walking with the catheter but you can't really feel it and the nurses are super patient. So when I was hugging the pillow they started prepping my back, they wiped it down once, let it dry, then the second time. Then then got the spinal block ready. They give you a local which stings for literally 5 seconds but it's cold and sudden so catches you off guard even though they warn you. Then within like 10 seconds my butt and legs got SUPER heavy. It's the WEIRDEST sensation. Like you can feel but you can't feel pain. So I could no longer feel the catheter which was the biggest relief for me because I found it really weird. Not painful, just weird. Then got me lying down on the table and got all my monitoring gear on. They then check how the epidural is going by using a little ice pack to see how high it's coming up. If they want it to move higher they actually tilt the bed because it runs up your spine obviously and gravity just does it's job - it's super cool. After about 5 minutes of angling me we were ready to go. The put up the blue sheet between my head and body and started. I couldn't feel anything except for pressure. It was weird but not in a bad way. My partner was up by my head and talking to him the whole time DEFINITELY helped because if I sat and focused on the weird sensations it just made me feel weird. They have to get through a muscle layer and it almost feels like a 'pop' sensation which kind of grossed me out, and I'm a vet nurse so I'm not squeamish at all. But once again, didn't hurt at all. Within like, 5 minutes they were like \"get your camera ready!\" and she was out. They held her up over the drape and she didn't cry, like expected so they showed her to me for a second and then got her on the monitoring table. But they called my partner over and he was allowed to hold her hand and talk to her and kiss her and everything so she wasn't by herself. They took all her measurements and once again, because she was small they had to check she was over the 10th percentile to make sure she didn't need to have her sugar levels checked and she JUST made it weighing in at 6oz1lb. After she was all measured, weighed and stable they brought her over to me for skin to skin. They lay her on my chest and I got to hold her. Me, her and my partner just cuddled for like 30-40 minutes while they stitched me up. Which I forgot was even happening because of everything going on. I almost felt a bit in shock because it was so weird that it had finally happened.  After that they put her back in her little crib and we went to recovery. In recovery they took her foot prints, gave her her vitamin K and hepatitis vaccines. Then when all that was done they gave her to me for her first feed. She latched super well but there was a midwife there to help me if I had issues. We stayed in recovery being monitored for minimum 30 minutes and once that was okay we came back down to our room and just hung out there together.  I was also incredibly anxious for the first night as our hospital protocol was that my partner could only stay 8am-8pm, but our midwife was lovely and let him stay until 9:30pm. It wasn't at bad as I expected being by myself with her, it was actually really nice having bonding time alone and I was basically awake all night just looking at her little face.  I really thought I was open minded and that my birth plan was 'healthy mum, healthy baby' through the whole pregnancy but when everything went topsy-turvy so fast, I was so disappointed having my 'choices' taken away from me. But, despite my entire birth plan going out the window, I couldn't have asked for a nicer experience. So if you, like me, have things go awry in the final weeks, please try your hardest to 'go with the flow' as best you can. I didn't believe people when they told me that 'once your baby is here, you won't care how they entered the world.' but it is so true.  I also know that I was very, very lucky with my birth being so positive. My midwife and doctor team were so lovely and made me feel so comfortable the whole time. So, if things don't go according to plan and you struggle with that, please talk to someone to work through those feelings because it is still overwhelming, even when it's overall positive.  As for now, Sadie Alice is 3 weeks old and is absolutely incredible. Apart from some jaundice that took a few weeks to be checked off by her midwife after a few blood tests - she's perfect. She sleeps like a rock, eats like a champion and is finally over 3kg so doesn't need any more midwife checks! I am so beyond in love and I feel so lucky to have had such a positive experience.",

    "self_text": "Not really sure exactly why I‚Äôm posting, more just to vent a little I guess. As the title says, was just discharged after a 48+ hour stay for threatened preterm labor. Was laying in bed Sunday night after baby‚Äôs dad had to go home for the week to work (don‚Äôt currently live together, was a long distance relationship and baby was a bit unexpected, should be together in the next month! As long as we aren‚Äôt hospitalized again that is because I‚Äôm moving to him and will be switching my care providers) but I noticed some oddly intense ‚ÄúBraxton hicks‚Äù that were just a bit too regular for my liking having had a baby before. For sh*ts and giggles I started timing them‚Ä¶ 4-6 mins apart lasting 30-45 seconds consistently for an hour and a half. Called the after hours nurse line, on call doctor said to take Tylenol and drink 16 oz of water plus rest over the next hour, and to call back if things stayed the same or got worse. By the end of the hour I had started contacting every 3/4 minutes and they were lasting about 62 seconds now. Called back and they said come in asap. Get to the hospital and on the monitors, contractions have stayed about the same, had not dialated yet, baby‚Äôs heartbeat was very strong and steady though she was not very happy about the turn of events and made it well known with plenty of kicks and rolls when they‚Äôd start poking and prodding at her (my belly). The first injection they tried slowed the contractions for about 2 hours, but as the medication worse off they came back same timing but stronger overall, so we were admitted. They went ahead and did another cervical check and we had dialated to just shy of 1cm so they decided it was time for a magnesium drip to hopefully bring things to a stop. Magnesium drip has worked for the most part, it at least got them to spread out to about 1/2 contractions an hour and much less intense. So they went ahead and sent us home after monitoring for a few hours off the drip. We are home now with very few restrictions but told to take it easy. Basically a very lose bed rest. If the contractions start coming back I was told to try Benadryl and a warm shower/ bath, if they don‚Äôt slow down after an hour or 2 it‚Äôs back to the hospital again. Just frustrated at this point, this is baby number 2 and we are now 2 for 2 on threatened preterm labor. My sons was triggered by a kidney infection at 29 weeks though, this is just completely out of the blue outside of me having the flu a week ago, and it‚Äôs so much earlier this time. The doctors said it really just seems like my body can only really handle one thing at a time when it comes to being pregnant or being sick, or that maybe it just gets a little  too  protective of baby and sends itself into a bit of flight mode to try and save the baby from illness too? I‚Äôm just at a loss. I honestly feel like my body is trying to fail me. I managed to hold out to 38 weeks with my son but I‚Äôm so scared that we will end up with a premie this time around because the contractions just won‚Äôt fully stop, only spread out. I spent a third of my last trimester with my son in and out of the hospital with preterm contractions. And it‚Äôs looking like we‚Äôre in for a similar experience this time aroundüò≠üò≠üò≠",

My boyfriend and baby‚Äôs father (26M) has a huge family on both sides that prioritizes getting together for holidays. Tomorrow is of course Thanksgiving in the US and while I am not feeling up to going I have agreed to go to his grandparents‚Äô house. With Christmas coming up as well, we have gotten quite a few texts about whether or not we will be at gatherings. There will be his grandparents on his dad‚Äôs side, his mom‚Äôs side, and his immediate family has asked us to come up from the 29th of December to the 2nd of January to stay (they live two hours north of us). My son will most likely be about three weeks old on Christmas and I am so nervous about bringing him to family gatherings. With RSV in full swing as well as Covid it‚Äôs already a lot, but with me being only three weeks postpartum at that point it‚Äôs even more. And then his mom asked us if we would stay with them for the four nights after the holidays and that put me in tears last night. I feel like so much is being asked and expected of me while having my brand new baby and freshly postpartum, still healing, bleeding, and in pain. I feel so much pressure to show up because I know it‚Äôs what my boyfriend wants and I don‚Äôt want to let him down, and I also worry that his family will have resentment towards me not bringing the baby to the gatherings. This is the first baby on his mom‚Äôs side in 19 years and everyone is very excited, but I wish they were more understanding. I worry about disappointing everyone and letting them down, and what they will think of me, including my boyfriend, but of course I also worry about my baby and I am feeling so overwhelmed.

    "title": "Seeking: Labor Experiences with Syncope and/or Cardiac Problems",
    "self_text": "There have been a number of posts about pregnancy/delivery with vasovagal syncope, and reading those posts and comments have made me feel quite a bit better about things! However, I have a strange form of vasovagal syncope that causes my heart to stop for a brief period of time (11 to 22 seconds have been clocked during tilt table tests in the past). I've been fainting since 16 months old, and my heart has always restarted on its own without intervention. My triggers are pain or perceived pain (myself being in pain, seeing others in pain, blood, etc.). I get a strong aura before an episode, allowing me to lay down to prevent concussions or other injuries.   I'm 19+5 and not terribly concerned with how it will affect pregnancy at this point (I've been handling blood draws like a boss so far!), but I am concerned about delivery. My OB and midwife haven't heard of this before (as most doctors haven't), and don't have any insight for me as to how this could affect labor/delivery. I'm trying to get in to see an autonomic specialist, but I haven't seen one in about 7 years, and it's looking unlikely anyone will be able to see me prior to my due date. I may see if I have better luck trying to speak with a cardiologist, specifically to get some facts as to if a cardiac pause would affect the baby (I'm having trouble finding research relating to this online).   All of this is to say, I have some concerns, and I thought I'd see if anyone here with similar experiences might have some advice.  First, as mentioned above, I don't know if anyone has any insight as to how a cardiac pause could affect blood flow to the baby. Sources would be very much appreciated.  My current plan is to get an epidural as soon as they'll allow me to during labor. I believe I'll handle the pain of getting the epidural better than I would handle the ongoing pain of contractions. I know that in some cases, the epidural can cause blood pressure to drop, which could be a different precipitator to an episode. I'm hoping they'll be monitoring me close enough to add something to my IV to correct quickly. My first concern is that I'll faint prior to the epidural (for example, when they put in the IV or during a contraction), and that they'll then be hesitant to administer an epidural. I'm not sure if there's any real substance to this concern, but I've seen doctors get weird or panicked on me after I've had an episode (for example, when I was 17 a doctor over-reacted and wanted to rush me into emergent surgery to place a pacemaker; my mom refused and my cardiologist later agreed that it wasn't necessary). My second concern is that the epidural will fail, at which point I don't know what my best option is. I worry that contractions could cause me to faint multiple times in a short period, and I worry that it could put a lot of stress on my heart (normally I only have a single episode at a time, though I've had up to 3 in a row before) or that the frequent cardiac pauses could negatively impact blood flow to the baby.  If it comes to a C-section, I have my own concerns. I've had two surgeries in the past. One was an out-patient procedure for the removal of a benign lipoma. I was under local anesthesia, but even though I wasn't experiencing pain, the sensations I was feeling caused me to have an episode during the procedure. I was strongly advised to be put under general anesthesia for similar procedures in the future. When I had an appendectomy and umbilical hernia repair, I was obviously put under general anesthesia and I didn't have any negative reactions. (I did, unfortunately, faint prior to the procedure when and IV was put in.) This leads me to believe I'd do better with being under general anesthesia for a C-section, but my research seems to suggest that this is only done in emergent situations (and has its own set of additional risks and complications).   My husband will definitely be in the delivery room with me, and I'm debating asking my mom if she would be willing to join as well. My husband has been wonderful learning how to advocate for me over the last five years, but he has never faced needing to do so in a high-pressure situation. My mom, on the other hand, has needed to deal with advocating for me in high-pressure medical situations. I'm still on the fence on having another person in the room, but I trust that she'd make the right calls under pressure.  Sorry for the info drop, and bless you if you actually read through all of this. My purpose in posting this is to see if anyone with vasovagal syncope AND/OR cardiac problems has insight as to how any of this might play out. Personal anecdotes, research, and advice are all appreciated here.",

I'm also super particular about things like this  if it's a party for me and little bub then I feel like it should go how I want it to! I know of family members who have had a Shower for each pregnancy, but I want to know if it could come off as me asking for stuff if I threw it myself for a second pregnancy. Thanks in advance!  Edit for a little extra context: We really don't have much that we CAN hand down to the next baby. And everything new out of pocket is gonna hurt a bit in the financial dept. Since we only got clothes, some new mostly used, is it acceptable to have just one more shower? Really, the only actual \"baby gear\" we got for #1 was from my mom who didn't attend the shower, and we will be needing a new stroller by the time next baby is born.",

I didn‚Äôt know her very well before my daughter was born, then all of a sudden they were over every day to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù. The drama started when we asked her to get the TDAP and flu shot - she left the house crying and sent some nasty emails to my husband, who eventually let it go. I‚Äôve had some underlying resentment towards her ever since, but we‚Äôve been civil to each other. Now that I‚Äôm pregnant with #2 we‚Äôre dealing with this argument again, except that my husband says he‚Äôs not backing down this time. Nasty emails were sent again and we were basically no contact for about a month and a half.   Now I guess my husband made up with them cause they‚Äôre back. Which would be fine, except MIL is now completely ignoring me. They walk into our house, FIL greets me, but MIL avoids eye contact and doesn‚Äôt acknowledge me during the entire visit. No hello/goodbye, nothing. This has happened 3 times already in the last 2 weeks and I get so hurt and upset every time. I‚Äôve tried bringing it up to my husband but he just wants me to be the bigger person. It happened again yesterday and I tried to hide how upset I was because my husband isn‚Äôt good at dealing with my feelings, but he could tell I was upset. I told him that his mom makes me feel like garbage and I started crying. He hates it when I cry, like he gets really mad/annoyed, sometimes yells at me when I cry. He said he can‚Äôt make everyone happy, that I can‚Äôt do anything to change her and I‚Äôll just have to accept it. He said that his ex-fiance left him because his mom also made her feel like garbage (he told me before that none of his previous relationships worked out because of his mom).   I‚Äôm just so angry that she gets to treat me like this and still have a relationship with my kid(s), all because my husband lets her get away with it. I feel like her wants and needs will always come before mine, even when it comes to my kids. I knew it was too good to be true when he told me a couple of weeks ago that he was ‚Äúdone with those people‚Äù after yet another nasty email from his parents. I feel so alone and unsupported, and afraid of how this constant disrespect towards me (and my husband) in our own house will affect my girls.  Edit: Thank you everyone so much for the support and tough love! I‚Äôm still going through all the comments and trying to get back to as many as I can (not much time with a sleepless toddler).

He‚Äôs my first and I did a vaginal delivery so to say I‚Äôm sore is an understatement lol Saturday was filled with trying to breastfeed, sleep, acclimate, and attempt to be comfortable with little to no sleep. Sunday (yesterday) was filled with the same but with person after person coming in and out of our room almost hourly for his tests, my check ups, paperwork, and everything in between. I cannot imagine what having visitors on top of everything would have been like in the last 48 hours.  If you‚Äôre considering no visitors I highly recommend it! It would have just been added stress, in my opinion, and not worth it. I‚Äôm definitely a grumpy when in pain person and don‚Äôt think I would have tolerated entertaining visitors well at all. Grandparents will come and see baby once we‚Äôre settled at home later today and that sounds much more doable after this whole experience and he‚Äôll still be less than 72 hours old so it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre missing much.",

    "self_text": "Dear future mothers,  I am a very private person who does not share personal aspects of her life with anyone. I hid my pregnancy during the first trimester. At the end of my third month, my husband told his family that I am pregnant. I can't explain how much my previous love for them has turned into hatred. I feel they want to interfere in my private life. I think they want to take away my baby.   Such strong feelings happened because they also have some strange costumes. For example, in their family, when a baby is born, the parents ask everyone in the extended family to give a suggested name, so they can choose one from the suggested names. I had a big argument with my husband that I do not want such stupid culture and I am the only one who should choose the name of \"MY\" baby. My husband said we still can do the stupid culture (asking for a suggested name), but in the end choose my preferred name. But, at the end of our discussion, my husband came to the conclusion if he does this stupid culture, it would end up in our divorce (since I have intense anger about this stupid ritual).  I also feel my MIL and my SIL want to insist that they knew I am pregnant from the first weeks. I know they are lying. But this level of insisting when I am such a private person has led to my haterade for all of them.   I used to love them. They are not mean people. They have always respected my boundaries. There was never any deliberate mean behavior in any of them. I think becoming pregnant for the first time in a patriarchal family (my husband is not one), being insisted that \"we knew you are pregnant\" (when I am such a private person), having some disrespectful cultures (naming a baby by the extended family), having a MIL who is a depressed housewife and thinks my baby is the one who brings her out of loneliness and depression, and many other things have changed my previous love to hatred.  I just wanted to share my story and seek your advice. I know I should be calm and avoid stress. But hatred of my family-in-low has taken away my peace of mind. I don't know how to keep calm and ignore them for my baby?",

They sent me to get an ultrasound to check amniotic fluid levels and said they are still within normal range but on the \"low end of normal\" so she is having me come back on Tuesday to check amniotic levels again. She thinks the bleeding is coming from the contractions I been having since friday. Although im not dilated she would like to wait for my body to go into labor on its own. Hopefully it will happen soon. Thank you to everyone who commented. Im so glad I came to get checked out and have some mental relief for now.   Edit: Thank you everyone. I am definitely going to the hospital to get checked out. I will post an update once I know what's going on.   Thinking about going to the hospital this morning to get checked out. Im 39w and i been having ongoing bleeding since yesterday. It started friday around 1 am and now its Sat and hasn't stopped. I am not bleeding heavily. Its light bleeding but continous as I have to change my panty liner multiple times throughout the day and light pink in color. I been getting very irregular cramps/contractions since friday that can he anywhere from minutes to hours apart. At first I thought it was my mucus plug \"bloody show\" but from what I read online it should have stopped by now?   Didn't want to go to hospital and get sent home since contractions are nowhere near regular and consistent. Last clinic visit, My Dr. stated that light bleeding or spotting was normal unless it was like a heavy period (which it's not) Would you still go to get checked out?",

    "self_text": "I love my MIL. She is incredible. We found out about her cancer diagnosis a few months after our wedding in 2021. My husband and I talked and agreed to try for children sooner than we had originally planned so she could meet her grandchild.  I‚Äôm currently less than 60 days out from my due date and we received news that her cancer has advanced. We don‚Äôt have a timeline but her treatment has switched to every week and it‚Äôs more intense than before. There‚Äôs so much wrapped up in the news, I‚Äôll try to bullet point it out.   For starters, my husband has helped picked up slack around the house as I‚Äôve had a difficult time keeping up with my normal half of the work. He is also incredible. The news has thrown him into a grieving process. He hasn‚Äôt been able to help as much and as a result things have started to slip. I‚Äôm trying my best to keep the basics in order.   We‚Äôve had so many open conversations about it but he‚Äôs definitely fearful that she will not make it to the birth. He‚Äôs also fearful about balancing his excitement for this new chapter of becoming a dad but also the thought of losing his mom who he is very close with. He wants to be there for me and make me a priority but his cup is definitely empty right now to pull from.   I‚Äôm also grieving as I love my MIL. She has been a huge part of my life these last few years. Another piece I‚Äôm personally stressing about is that she‚Äôs been the primary child care for my BIL‚Äôs two kids and had expected to take on our baby as well. I know we will figure that piece out but it‚Äôs still a genera worry.   Overall, this news is devastating and we‚Äôre working through some complicated emotions. We‚Äôre lucky to have a very strong support system of family and friends but it doesn‚Äôt make anything easier.   Any advice or ways to help my husband through this are so appreciated",

Little anti scratch mittens for baby's hands.

If you have a nest thermostat, a real help to my anxiety has been buying a sensor for where baby sleeps so I can prioritize his room to be the correct tempature ( the rest of the house, I don't care about maintaining a certain temp)  Pacifiers multiple  Little face cloths ( baby acne is normal, and you need to wash your babies face alot)  A little chair of some sort for them to sit back in during the day (ours is Fisher price and our baby likes that it vibrates)",

And then turned into a little argument then he said fuck you. And I couldn‚Äôt even enjoy the first few hours of my son being here and I cried for hours the my son opened his eyes and he makes so many faces already he‚Äôs so precious. Then later their dad is at the house and he goes in my wallet for my food stamp card I‚Äôm completely mad because I don‚Äôt like people in my stuff especially when they don‚Äôt ask. I just want to go home now.",

That has been working great and my nausea has been pretty manageable with the medication. Last week it was practically gone. On Friday morning it came back with a vengeance! My Zofran won‚Äôt even touch it now. I have tried B6, ginger, snacking more frequently, sour lollies. All of these helped before a few days ago. Now if I‚Äôm not laying still and just sipping water (even after medication) I have to run to the bathroom to vomit.  I see my doctor in 10 days after my NT scan, so I will ask her then what else I could do, but I need help until then.   Is it normal that the nausea gets worse at 11 weeks? I have to be so switched on at work and I am struggling with how this week will go if I‚Äôm this sick :(",

I notice that at night baby comes up very high under my ribs exactly where the pain was comes from.. It is mainly only hurts when I sleep or lay on my right side.  One night last week it got so bad that in the morning I went to the hospital, fearing pre-eclampsia or Hellp syndrome. After a full abdominal ultrasound, blood tests, liver enzyme test, urine test, I was all cleared. No scary results. All normal.  I'm stumped. During the abdominal ultrasound the pain began to flare up because they had me laying on my right side. I said it was flaring up and suggested we look where the pain is. We looked and yes we did see baby up under my ribs. \"We caught him!\" I exclaimed. Lol. Of course the pain wasn't at its worse yet. I sat up to let the pain subside.  But this only happens at night or when laying on my right side, and the longer I sleep on my right side, the worse the pain is when I abruptly wake up in indescribably painfull pain. My husband has to push my back until I am in an upright position so I can stand up. The pain is too unbearable to use my own body strength to sit up.  The pain is sharp, and hot like a hot knife in my ribs, right where the ribs meet the pregnant belly.  I have to stand up to walk it off and it can take several minutes of being in agony to subside. It is like torture. I can't talk in full sentences or communicate it hurts so much when it flares up.  Am I going crazy? Can a baby under ribs cause this much pain? What is going on in there? The pain is in such a small, precise area. I am worried something has been missed.  No injuries or broken/ hurt ribs.",

    "self_text": "Hi everyone!   Just wanted to say a big thank you to everyone for all the love on my other posts about our little guy having fluid in his belly and sharing your experiences with Amniocentesis testing. Much appreciated! Our appointment last week wound up being a very long 6 hour day at the hospital, with an extra scan on top of the already extra scans and pokes. We got a lot of unexpected news that has been a lot to process but here goes the update...  The fluid in our little guy's belly had already gone down a bit (yay!), but they found something worrisome with his heart. The doctor we saw wanted us to have the pediatric cardiologist do an additional echocardiogram on baby. So we met with the pediatric cardiologist, who said that although his little heart is pumping and running beautifully (he actually said beautifully which was nice)....baby's main arteries are actually reversed (something called Transposition of the Great Arteries).   So our little guy will need heart surgery right after he's born.ü•∫   Needless to say it's been a heavy week with a ton of information thrown at us. The team of doctors and nurses were amazing though and I know we will be well taken care of. I did decide to go ahead with the amniocentesis after finding out about his heart issue, so we have as much information as possible before he arrives. So we're still waiting on those results. We will now have to go for check ups every 2 weeks or so, 3 hours from home. Then when I'm around 36-37 weeks (I'm 23 weeks now), we'll have to relocate to a city 4 hours away to be closer to the Children's Hospital when it's time for little guy to make his arrival. I'm still kind of in shock but feel super grateful the doctors will take care of us and have a plan. We of course are shocked and worried but also very optimistic that he will be just fine after surgery. He's been moving around a ton and waking Mama up with his karate kicks so he's doing well.‚ù§Ô∏è   I'm terrified but I know there are amazing things doctors can do these days and so far I've read a lot of positive stories, people having the surgery as babies and being over 30 years of age now so that gives me hope.  Please keep us in your thoughts and thank you all again for being so kind and offering sweet words and advice on my earlier posts! If anyone has been through similar or has any words of advice or comfort, I would love to hear from you! ‚ù§Ô∏èü§ó",

    "self_text": "FTM-40weeks & 5days My work only pays for my boyfriend and I (we work together, same hoursüò¨ we're switching our schedules though to make this work after) anyway our work only pays for 2 weeks off for each of us. And I know that 2 weeks isn't a long time. I'm not sure how fast \"recovering\" will be for me or what the baby is even going to be like by that time. We can't really afford for me to not be working and not getting paid.  People who have used FMLA, does there need to be a specific reason to get more paid time off? Like say I have a smooth birth and don't have a serious medical reason to stay out longer can I use FMLA and get at least partial pay for an additional week or more so I don't have to rush back into work and have more time to recover from being pregnant? I know it takes a toll on your body and most people I've told I'm only going to stay out of work for 2 weeks seemed shocked and say it's not enough time. But I can't afford to stay out longer than that completely unpaid.  Sorry the post is so scrambled but I guess my initial questions are: -How long do mom's usually stay out of work to \"recover\"? -People that have had smooth births or not smooth births have used FMLA after the initial maturnity leave was used and got paid even partial pay?  -Has anyone gone back to work after just the two weeks and how did that go?  Idk I think I have more questions but I'd like to hear anything from anyone on the situation I guess.",

    "title": "Call center for after hours triage very rude",
    "self_text": "So I called the after hour call service today. I've had very itchy hands for the last week or so. Which can be an indicator that your liver isn't working properly. I'm 38 weeks pregnant so it can be concerning at this point. I had no idea this was a thing, but I put in \"itchy hands at 38 weeks\" into Google because it has felt like I was going to itch them off at some points. Seeing it was an indicator for the liver not working properly I wanted to talk to a nurse to figure out if I needed to wait until Monday to get blood work done at my doctor's office or what would their suggestion be.   The triage person was so fucking rude and condescending. She asked me where I heard that itching hands is something I should be worried about and as soon as I said Google, she wrote me off. She started to ask triage questions, but kept inserting condescending comments. I politely called her out on it and explained that itchy hands can be the only indicator for the liver not working properly and can be dangerous at 38 weeks and that I just needed to know how to proceed and that she was making me feel silly. She then acted all baffled that I said she was trying to make me feel silly. I said point blank that she is and was being rather rude. It was the truth, a dangerous truth, because her attitude could keep someone from getting help they needed just because she deemed it silly and that the person googled it.   Well she was about to continue triage questions and said, \"I have to keep asking questions, even if they make you feel silly\". I said, \"the questions don't make me feel silly, I'll answer any triage questions, but the questions aren't what made me feel silly\". At this point she sighed and said, \"I'm just going to get with a nurse, that will make this go faster\". Then she hung up. Called back a few mins later with a heightened dramatic voice, \"the nurse said if you're concerned go to the er\". I said, \"but I have a doctors appointment on Thursday so I'm wondering if I should wait until that or if there is a fast track place I can get blood work done. Because obviously this isn't an emergency and I'm trying to get advice\". She then yelled at me, \"the nurse said to go the er if you're concerned, that's the only option\". I just politely got off the phone with her at that point.   Then I went to my chart to see what she put in the notes about me which absolutely proves that she was being rude and condescending to me the whole time. She put reason for calling is, \"patient googled itchy hands and saw it could mean liver disease. Then accused me of making fun of her. Wouldn't answer triage questions and wanted to just talk to a nurse. Was told to get to er for her concerns. We don't expect that she will go. Wanted to know if there was somewhere she could go to just get labs done.\"  I did not refuse to answer triage questions, I even told her to go on with her questions, she purposely didn't mention that I wanted to know if I should wait to talk to my doctor. She worded it all in a way to make me sound crazy. Just because she couldn't handle her attitude being called out. An attitude that is dangerous and could keep someone from seeking help. I'm just not sure what to do. If I call this woman back and tell her how awful she was and how dangerous her attitude can be then she will just write up another nasty note about me making me look unhinged. I was completely polite to her too. My tone stayed polite while hers didnt. She was just a total freaking old hag Karen. Idk what to do  Edit: I came to L&D. Baby is on the monitor right now and is doing great. Going to be monitored a bit longer because I've had a few contractions since I've been here. They want me to wait until Monday and call my doctor to get blood work done, but since baby isn't in distress they think all is okay. So everything is looking good and the staff has been so nice! The woman on the phone this morning can kick rocks",

There was a  delivery delay, so I got them two days after shipping. I spent an  emotional day repeatedly calling FedEx to no avail. I was distraught.  The following morning I rushed over to  FedEx to pick up the tank.  I inseminated 20 minutes later in the  backseat of my Jeep. I inseminated in my Jeep again about 4 hours after  that. It turns out that shipping delay was God working in mysterious  ways. If I‚Äôd gotten the tank on time, I would‚Äôve inseminated too early. I'm super excited!",

    "self_text": "28w. On Sunday my husband and I went to L&D because I was sure I had felt less movement than usual. Before, my little one was fairly active and used to have periods of pretty intense movement (including a sort of shivering/shaking) in between periods of quiet.  I was hooked up to the monitors and satisfied all of its requirements within 15mins (enough movements and heart rate doing the right things) so they let us go. I feel awful, like I wasted their time, but I'm glad I went just in case. But I'm sure I'm not feeling as much as before.  I feel movement but the periods of moving are shorter and the kicks themselves are not as strong. It also seems like the times it is active have shifted so it doesn't move so much in the evenings and when I go to bed any more. I think I might have a touch of confirmation bias about this and I don't know how to be sure that everything is OK. Trying very hard not to drive myself to distraction about it.

    "self_text": "Graduated 9 days ago! Little guy made his debut almost a month early after a pre-eclampsia diagnosis following a trip to the ER due to an episode of losing half my field of vision for a 10 minute period. After a clear CT scan, I was admitted to Labor & Delivery and put on Magnesium while awaiting an MRI, which also came back clear. At that point I was told I was being diagnosed with pre-eclampsia and would be induced. We were told the induction process could take days, but after only two doses of the medication to start the process, my water broke naturally and little guy decided he was ready to come. From there it was a matter of a few hours till we welcomed our baby boy. I gave birth in a hospital with an epidural and honestly didn't know what to expect, but I couldn't have imagined it going any better. I was definitely in control through the whole process and still had mobility to move into multiple positions through the labor process as well as be able to tell when contractions were coming and it was time to push. I was a huge concern of mine that I would lose all feeling and it would be fully guided by the doctors so I was very happy that I got to have a sense of control while still controlling the pain. Unfortunately little guy went straight to the NICU due to his little lungs not being quite ready and I couldn't see him for a full 24 hours because of being on Magnesium. I did however get to pump and provide colostrum for him from day one, which really helped. Little guy spent his first 6 days of life in the NICU as he struggled to pass all his milestones for discharge. It was definitely hard coming home without my baby and not getting to start out breastfeeding like I had planned but after 4 days of having him home I will say don't fret if this happens to you, the baby will still come around to breastfeeding and the bond will still be there. Sorry for the long post, but wanted to share my story in case it helps someone else.",

    "self_text": "I don‚Äôt know how even start this because I feel a bit crazy by now. My partner and I moved to a new apartment in August. The building is new (1 or 2 years built) all good until I found out in September I was pregnant.  By week 6 or 7 my sense of smell increased as expected. And I found certain smells in my apartment that I don‚Äôt like. I don‚Äôt know how to describe them but is the smell in the closets, cabinets, shelves. This is not a previous tenant smell. Seems to me that might be the wood which the covers were built or the glue or something like that. I started lighting inciense, I bought air freshener that after also got sick of it. Then I went to a nice candle store and bought candles with autumn smell, after a couple of weeks I also got sick of them. I tried a diffuser with scented oils. I can‚Äôt get rid of the smell. Then I decided to do deep cleaning like I‚Äôve never done in my life wiping cabinets inside out, mopping every week. I love mr. clean smell but does not last long, Lysol sometimes helps a bit. For more than I clean the apartment the damn smell still there. The problem? Makes me puke every day, just once a day or twice. I feel so grossed out I just hate this weird smell and sometimes I hate being at home (I work from home) My partner agrees that the weird smell exists, but of course doesn‚Äôt bother him as me. I‚Äôm helping myself wearing a mask (indoors yes) with essential oils like lavender or eucalyptus. I just find the whole situation ridiculous but is real and I‚Äôm sick of it. I wish we could move somewhere else. Anyone else experiencing a weird obsessed situation like this? Thanks for reading!",

My midwife let me know that baby is healthy and everything looked great except for mild dilation of the kidneys. She said the left was 6mm and the right was 5mm and that anything above 4mm was considered to be dilated. She called it mild bilateral pyelectasis and said that most cases will resolve on their own however I will need to have an additional ultrasound in the beginning of the 3rd trimester to see if the condition has improved or worsened. I read online that pyelectasis is fairly common in male fetuses, but we are having a girl.   She also mentioned that pyelectasis is a soft marker for Down Syndrome however I did NIPT testing earlier in my pregnancy and everything came back low risk with a 12.9% fetal fraction. So they are not concerned about the possibility of Down Syndrome.   Has anyone else had experience with this?",

So I thought \"okay baby must be uncomfortable, let's do the 3 point turn and lay on the other side\". So I roll over and... so... does... baby. Felt the weird wobble it does like its rotating your stomach along with it kind of thing. It starts kicking the other side, stops and stretches out and stays stretched. Tf baby? What do you want?

Something about her saying she's excited for herself rubbed me the wrong way. She has in the past during my pregnancy so far made plans without consulting me that me and my husband had to stop like them planning for us to host Thanksgiving, apparently she's coming to watch our dog and clean while I'm in the hospital etc.   I understand why she's excited to become a grandmother sonim wondering if I am being over sensitive or if this was as weird and off-putting as I feel like it is.  Update: my MIL came down to help us get some cleaning done this past weekend. My husband ended  up talking to her to explain to her that I am anxious about being overwhelmed ( I am and we have talked about it- i feel this is where some of my irritation has been coming from with how excited his side is)  This actually helped the 3 of us talk about how to handle when the little one arrives and I think help me to help her understand some of my concerns with the change in hormones of post partum.

    "self_text": "(Trigger Warnings Ahead)Hi, so I've posted on here a few times, I'm almost 21 weeks now and I'm super excited but also nervous of the up coming weeks. This is not my first pregnancy but the first to last this long (the other one to last a good minute I had a miscarriage at 16 weeks) and 3 others at 7-8 weeks. I've been having symptoms of preclamsia but I'm not sure if I actually have it. What's even more worrisome is that just about all females in my  family have babies extremely early, one being at 21w5ds and he did live but only for a little over a month. The doctors have no explanations of why this happens to my family but as I get closer to these days I'm so scared it could happen to me. I go to the doctors Wednesday and I'm already planning on asking them to check me for preclamsia just to be safe. I was never put on high risk because they didn't see the need with it being military doctors and not wanting to actually listen to me about my medical history and family's history. I know family history doesn't really play a part into it but it seems to with mine.",

I was diagnosed due to elevated BP (highest was 160/107 before they put me on medicine), protein in my urine, hyperreflexia, the clonus reflex, and frequent nearly constant headaches with spots/glitter in my vision.   I have been in the hospital twice since being diagnosed, the first time for four days, where they put me on a magnesium drip to prevent seizures and protect mine and my daughter's brains. They also gave me the betamethasone shot for her lungs. During this stay they had the NICU team come speak to me about what my daughter's prognosis would look like should she be born soon...it's not great. She would have a lot of potentially lifelong issues. I am grateful that my hospital has a level 3 NICU, however!  I was discharged due to my BP being stable on the medicine and my labs looking relatively okay for the time being, and landed back there less than 24 hours later because I went to my OB appointment and my BP was 150/90, and I had such a bad headache that left me feeling weak, with increased spots in my vision.   My second stay in the hospital was three days, where they monitored me and had multiple consults with neurology to insure that my headaches and vision problems weren't being caused by something more serious. They aren't- and all doctors now agree that they are preeclampsia caused. My BP remained relatively controlled and my labs were decent so they sent me back home.  I asked my OB, however, on the day he discharged me, at what point they would take my daughter out regardless should I stay stable. He said 34 weeks.  He said that there is still a great chance I will deliver before 34 weeks, because the second something goes wrong she has to come out. I have a notch on my uterine artery and they are concerned it will cause growth restriction.   No matter what happens, my daughter will be premature, and I can't help but feel so guilty about it. Like it's my fault...even though I know it isn't. They aren't even sure what causes preeclampsia.   Right now, my team's current goal is for me to get to 28 weeks. I have weekly appointments with Maternal Fetal Medicine and my OB. My next being tomorrow with MFM...I'm really hoping that it goes well enough that I avoid the hospital. My OB said next time I have to be admitted that he will not be sending me home.",

However, from the first test I had during my 3rd week and the second test I just had today my doctor was able to confirm that my HcG is doubling at a rate of 1.7. So would it even be worth it/necessary to go in for another blood test in a couple days? My doctor is not recommending another and my first OB appointment is in 4 weeks.   Also curious to know what others‚Äô HcG counts were this far along. According to what I see online my HcG is high for the 5th week. Is there a such thing as a HcG that is ‚Äútoo high‚Äù?",

I moved past it and tried to bring up other issues I had been having. I‚Äôve been experiencing numbness and pain in my feet and hands, and sometimes the pain in my hands shoot‚Äôs up to my forearms.

    "self_text": "29, FTM expecting twins   On Monday, at 29 weeks (2 days) I went to my OB‚Äôs office for my final 3hr glucose test and cervix length. I didn‚Äôt have an appointment with my actual doctor, which of course is not usually the case. So I get through my 3hr and I‚Äôm feeling great - excited to do the final cervix length and then head to lunch. Well, the ultrasound showed some major shortening, while I was ~3cm on 11/10, they were getting a max measurement of ~1.8cm‚Ä¶ good day to not get to talk to my doctor. So they send us on our way and tell me that I‚Äôll get a call later that day with advice/instructions. The MA spoke with the other 2 providers at the office and basically all I was told was to go back to the MFM doctor for (I guess) a second opinion and then keep my appointment with them in two weeks. MFM doctor called me to schedule last night and can‚Äôt get me in until the 9th (my next OB appt is the 12th, ugh!). I know it‚Äôs not too long from now but I‚Äôm scared that every little cramp/discomfort is early labor - except that I have no concept of what I should be watching for. I don‚Äôt remember what a period cramp feels like and I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs normal at this stage vs what I should be concerned about and I don‚Äôt want to rush off to L&D a million times, but I also don‚Äôt want my babies born too premature. I know I‚Äôm past viability at this point and things would be okay, but I‚Äôm not ready yet. I want them to stay in as long as possible so they‚Äôre healthy and good to go home shortly after delivery.   I had some shortening around 23 weeks but it was only like 2.7cm so not a major concern and then went back up, so I thought I was good.   I‚Äôm relying (hoping more than anything) that if it‚Äôs happening, I‚Äôll just  know  but what if I don‚Äôt? What if I chalk it up something else because I‚Äôve dealt with chronic pain for most of my life and don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúoverreact‚Äù.   I‚Äôm trying to take it easy and not stress but it‚Äôs hard when two little lives are relying on me and I feel like I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing.",

I feel lucky it happened easily but also I am now planning the wedding in a hurry (trying for late February) and finding it overwhelming. On top of that we bought a house last year and have been planning on renovating it before moving in but he has been dragging his feet on even starting and now I feel we won‚Äôt have it ready in time. He keeps saying next week but I stopped believing him months ago. I snapped at him via text today and told him I have lost all trust in his word on when this renovation will be done. To top it all off I left my job last year to travel with him and finally got the courage to start my own business the same week I found out I was pregnant. All of it is good news but all of it is very overwhelming and each aspect could be stressful on its own but compounded I feel like I am just beyond my capability to handle it. I‚Äôm also feeling like I am going to lose my ability to function because the first trimester exhaustion is already hitting HARD. I am doing nothing so far today which is the opposite of what I should be doing. I am going to schedule talk therapy and I‚Äôm hoping it helps me think and see more clearly because the fog of stress is making me feel so depressed.

I'm lacking as a mom to my toddler because I'm struggling so much so I decided to use 2 of my 12 weeks FMLA to stay home and get through the worst of this (I'm hoping). I'm 10 weeks now. The hard part is I make up a huge chunk of our income, the majority of it. I wish my husband had a better job. Anyway, I'm feeling defeated but I'm also trying to give myself grace and realize mental health is important too, especially when carrying a baby. Can anyone relate?",

    "self_text": "Yesterday morning I had an ultrasound and my baby was healthy, had a strong 170 heart beat and my doc said everything thing looked great. Fast forward to 1am that night I woke to pee like I do every night and there was blood in my pee. At first place I was petrified because it was dark but as I continued to pee it lightened up. At the end it was simply pink transparent pee. Therefore I presume only a few drops of blood was present. I'm not sure if I overreacted but I went straight to the hospital. The doctors in the hospital said I didn't overreact. But my grandmother who's gone through 12 pregnancies with my mom said it would be a waste of a trip and tried to calm me down. She did, a lot. They did another ultrasound, blood work, and pelvic exam. They couldn't find the source of the blood, my cervix was closed, baby was still there, heartbeat was still 170, but they're not sure why I was bleeding, possibly a separation between they yolk and placenta. Something like that. They called it a miscarriage threat and said the bleeding does heighten my chances of having a miscarriage.  I'm going back and forth between being excited like I was yesterday morning after the first ultrasound to be scared out of my mind to work out, sleep certain ways, eat anything spicy (ik this is a myth but I had just eaten a bag of chips with an bottle of Tabasco sauce, I had spotting after eating takis about a week before too). I‚Äôm rethinking everything I did yesterday and telling myself I can't do any of it again for the rest if my pregnancy. I just hate this feeling of being so uncertain of how things are going to go. The chance that within 6 months something really good and beautiful is going to happen but there's also a chance that within 6 months I'm going to experience one of the darkest moments in my life alone. To not go mad I plan to take my preventative measures even if they are not scientifically proven. I also plan to keep moving along as if I'm definitely going to have the baby so that I'm not emotionally split every single day. I guess I just want to hear from the people who have experienced this and what the outcome of their pregnancy was. Sorry I know that's an intimate topic for most but any info would help me prepare at least a bit mentally. This has been a rollercoaster but I really just want to be happy and excited and see my baby.   Tl;Dr This is my first pregnancy, I've had some bleeding, doctors say thinks look fine but my chances of miscarriage have increased. I know I sound dumb but I'm highly suspicious of spicy food being the cause. Any advice or anyone want to share their experience with bleeding. I'm 10 weeks 6 days in, so it's not implantation bleeding. Baby seems fine and healthy.",

We‚Äôre excited but also a bit stressed because my morning sickness has been a bit intense and there‚Äôs a lot we still need to do for the house. For example, we need a lot of new furnitures and to get shades/blinds installed on all the windows. We also have an anxious cat who I think will take some time to get used to all the new space.   I love my grandma and am very close with her, but she just booked tickets to visit us at our new home a few weeks after we move in. We are not ready for guests and I am not comfortable with entertaining right now. We had a conversation about a week ago where she mentioned visiting and I said sometime early next year would be better for us and that our cat needs to get used to the space. But she went ahead and booked these tickets anyway, and only informed me afterwards.   I am now really upset and stressed out. This means we now need to prioritize getting our guest room together ASAP, when we already had other areas of the home we wanted to focus on first. I‚Äôm hesitant to push back on her right now because we  will  need her help eventually, but I thought she understood that now isn‚Äôt a good time.   I think my mom played a role in convincing her to do this as well, because my mom has lowkey been wanting my grandma out of her house. They don‚Äôt have the best relationship and I don‚Äôt want to make my grandma feel like a burden. My suspicion is based on the fact that my mom asked me if my grandma mentioned visiting me. I told my mom that now isn‚Äôt a good time and she said that I should ‚Äúrethink that‚Äù and tried to get me to concede.   I‚Äôm really tired of my family not listening to what my needs are. They‚Äôve done this since I was a little girl. They always think they know better than I do and try to strong-arm me into doing things their way. I‚Äôm fucking 30 years old now and I feel like a child. I‚Äôve never asked them for anything and I thought that since I‚Äôm pregnant and sick all the time, maybe they‚Äôll listen to me for once.   Anyway, idk if I necessarily want advice. I know I should tell them to back off but this hard because of my relationship with my grandma and how things have been difficult for her too.

I haven‚Äôt even taken a bump photo because I don‚Äôt care.   Feeling this way has been shocking for me. I‚Äôm worried I won‚Äôt care about the baby or be interested in being a mom once they come.  I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm doing this to my husband. That is the worst part for me. I am robbing him of this experience, and if I don‚Äôt turn it around before/after the baby comes I will totally destroy his dreams/vision of family life.  He doesn‚Äôt deserve this, and has been over the moon excited to be a dad and start a family for years now.  My husband is aware of all my feelings and has been super supportive. I talked about terminating for awhile and he supported that as well, not wanting to move forward with a pregnancy until we were both sure and ready.   I also feel like I‚Äôm letting myself down. Just allowing these moments to pass by. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll regret it later.   I‚Äôm sorry for the long post. I feel like I can‚Äôt share this with anyone other than my husband without being judged.",

    "self_text": "At my last appointment with my doctor, they gave me some paper work for a Nuchal Translucency (NT) Ultrasound. I was told this looks for things like down syndrome and stuff. Where it took what I think was a really weird turn was she asked me if after this test I learn my baby has a problem will I be aborting?  I was taken aback by this question as I didn't expect her to ask this, let alone ask if I was going to have an abortion.  I said I honestly had not even considered this, but right now it would make no difference for me to learn this child has issues it would just be nice to be prepared for that as early as possible.  She had what sounded like a sigh of relief and had a huge change in her tone and body language almost as if she was pleased I \"answered the question correctly\"  I couldn't stop thinking about it... and how she would of reacted to someone or even me who would of said the opposite.  It made me really uncomfortable and felt that this doctor might be incredibly judgmental and I didn't like that at all.  These tests are to provide the mother more information on there babies and if they choose to not bring a child into this world, for whatever reason that be, that is their desire and not one to be judged for.  Maybe I'm over thinking this like crazy, but it really truly felt to me as if this doctor was extremely judgemental which concerns me about my future with this doctor because what if something else comes up and we don't \"agree\" on something...  How can I trust this doctor is providing me reasonable advice and not biased?",

    "self_text": "My BIL is in the military due to COVID and babies they have not been to the US in 3 years. They have two kids 5 and 2. They will be in the states for 2 weeks a week or two after we have our second. My in laws don't really understand home boundaries and even when we had a one bedroom apartment would stay with us (which is anywhere from 4-6 people not counting the brother from out of the country). When we had our first I said we could not have the 9 people at the time in our one bedroom so they got an Airbnb. They did ask though! This time around we have a larger home and I no longer have the space excuse. I just don't want to clean up and deal with 10 people staying/being at my house that soon after birth. Plus I remember breastfeeding initially was tough so my boobs were just out constantly. I would now have to go upstairs to feed him while recovering. My husband thinks a compromise is having his brother, wife and 2 kids stay with us and the rest can stay with his niece or other brother. Since both have one bedroom apartments I know everyone will use our house as homebase and be here all the time regardless. I'm really worried about all the things mentioned plus sleep for us and even them bringing in illnesses. It has become an issue between me and my husband at this point BC we can't come to an agreement. He thinks if we ask his parents to get an Airbnb they just won't come to our city and he won't get to see his brother. I'm pushing for the Airbnb so we can meet up when possible. What do I do? Keep up the good fight and put my foot down or allow the \"compromise\" just make my husband do EVERYTHING while they are here and I just hide up in our room with the baby 80% of the time.",

    "self_text": "Let me start by saying I‚Äôm in the US (Louisiana to be specific) and I know compared to other countries, our pregnancy and maternal benefits are pathetic. I could rant about this for hours but I digress. I have been extremely nauseous for my entire pregnancy, throwing up at least once a day usually, but nauseous every. Single. Day. I am now 30 weeks and also getting extremely fatigued as well. My job is very busy and requires me to travel around to other businesses nearly daily and I am just absolutely drained. Between these two issues, I truly feel like I can‚Äôt continue to work at this pace but my job really isn‚Äôt willing to accommodate a less stressful work load. Nor is work from home an option. I am now out of PTO because I‚Äôve used it so frequently to cover the days I‚Äôve been vomiting (+normal sickness/vacation). I really feel like I need to take off until the baby comes but since I‚Äôm out of PTO, my job says the only way I can take leave is if my doctor puts me on bed rest and short term disability kicks in. Otherwise, I can either continue working and struggling to get through every day or quit. If I quit, I lose my health insurance right before I‚Äôm due. My husband is going to put me on his health insurance (mine is way better so I never went on his) this week but benefits wouldn‚Äôt start for a little while, so if I quit, I‚Äôd be taking a big risk of the baby coming while I‚Äôm not covered. I‚Äôm going to see my doctor this week and explain my situation but I‚Äôm scared she won‚Äôt want to put me on bed rest for my issues because their not really risky issues. Any thoughts/advice/opinions welcome on how to handle where I‚Äôm at!  (Disclaimer: I take zofran daily already & my job does not qualify for FMLA due to size)",

I then became pregnant again and had slight spotting at 6 weeks again so my OB (before my current doc) gave me a rhogam shot since I‚Äôm AB-. The embryo/fetus has been fine since then.   Fast forward to now (currently 13 weeks), I get blood work done at 11 weeks and it says I am positive for Anti-D antibodies. How will my OB know if it is just a false positive from the rhogam or if it is true sensitization from my previous miscarriage? Will it require an amniocentesis or is there a less invasive route?

    "title": "MIL/Living situation rant",
    "self_text": "Be warned, this is a long rant.   (TLDR: house is still being renovated and I am dreading the fact I still will be living with MIL after giving birth.)  I have  6 to 8 weeks before baby arrives and Ive been trying to deal with the saddening fact that I will be most likely still leaving with my partners mother after I give birth.  We were trying so hard to get the house livable before the baby came. When we originally bought it, we thought it just needed to be cleaned up, have a few minor things replaced and then painted. Nope. Fast forward to a year of surprise problems and road bumps and we are still trying to get things done.  Before we even got pregnant things were going well, and the house was on track to be done within 3 months or sooner. We had to gut everything out of this house and ended up spending way more money then we should have because of naivet√© and people scamming us. So that inevitably prolonged the renvovations. We lost so much money going with the wrong people and so much time having to wait for work to begin during which time I ended up pregnant but it was all good. The house should have been done with me having 5 months left before baby arrived. But more obstacles prevented that.  I still had hope that I'd be going with my new baby into my new home, even if that home wasnt 100 percent perfect. I settled on having the bare minimum done before we moved in and we could work on the rest while we lived there. Everything was again, set to be done by December. But life strikes again and that is no longer the case, unless a miracle happens and that is quite depressing for me.  We still live with my partners mother who is overbearing, has no respect for privacy and doesn't seem to understand the word 'no'. I am a very private person, and I don't like people in my space or constantly asking me questions that quite frankly, are none of their business. This is a struggle for me because Im in the constant state of needing basic privacy but not being able to get it because it's not my place to tell someone in their home to back off and get of my space.  The house is hers so every space is her space.   Over the years she has said and done things that quite honeslty made me go from thinking she was a nice lady to 'if I never saw her again, it wouldn't bother me.' For the longest I been able to just ignore her behavior and brush it off. Take it like a grain of salt, but the last straw for me was when she falsely accused me of physically hitting her sons child. (BIL kid, so my niece)  She went to the childs parents and told them that I was hitting her until she was crying and screaming in agony I only stopped because  she managed to run away.  This happened about a year ago but even now typing it makes me so mad. I watched this kid since she was born. I never raised a hand to her or even raised my voice at her, and  for this woman to go lie on me about child abuse basically was just too much. Even more insulting, this woman never seen me be aggressive or angry towards the toddler 1 time.  MIL has even commented that I  had way more patience then she ever could. This is also a woman who has screamed, yelled and at times cursed out this 3 year old when she gets frusturated.   Her entire lie was based off of nothing but the child crying and her own internal negative beliefs that she apparently had about me. Every 3 year old has temper tantrums and crying fits, but my goodness if you heard the poor girl screaming you'd think someone was trying to hurt her when in reality they just told her to pick up her toys.  Thankfully her parents knew this was a lie or an over exaggeration on MIL part. But even so,  to prevent further lies and stress to me I just stopped watching her and letting her hang with me. Hard to make up lies if I don't let an opportunity present itself.  After that incident I was D-O-N-E any chance of trying to have a relationship beyond hi and bye was thrown out the window. I wanted to pack my stuff and go. But at the time I legit had no where to go. All my savings had just went into the house we bought that we couldnt live in just yet. At this early stage, I was still under the impression that the house would be done soon and I figured I can hold off for a few more months then that turned into a year and here we are. Still waiting.   Not only does this woman seem to think so poorly of me, but as I stated she has no sense of boundaries or privacy.   We can't lock the doors unless they lead to the outside. She doesn't like locked doors and she will bang and yell until the door is unlocked and then accuse you of using drugs which is why you needed the door locked. Not the logical answer, which is your doing something private, like pooping, showering, changing  clothes, or engaging in intimate activities.  She will rifle through my personal things and take items if she finds them useful. Most of the time she won't even say she took something and I find out by finding it in a place I did not put it.  Enters the room at all hours of the night to randomly scream or yell about something regardless of us having to go to work and ya know, needing sleep.   Many times I have come home to our stuff thrown on the floor and spread out in the hallway like the police just raided our room. Her reasoning: im cleaning your room, your welcome. But the room was never dirty to began with. The only thing that was messy was our bed. Niether of us find it a priority to make the bed when we leave the house. We are wild sleepers.  She likes to invite people over and into our room with out notice. She just opens the door to introduce us to distant relatives or family friends. People niether of us know or will ever remember exist. More than half the time she does this we are sleep and or indecent. So it's always awkward for the people she brings with her and us.  No doubt that with a new baby she will be constantly barging in, waking me up,  waking up baby. Giving me unsolicited outdated advice and basically trying to take controlled of everything baby related. I have no problems with telling someone no, but my issue is I am blunt and to the point. My words unintentionally hurt feelings. Given I already don't really like her that much it is a huge struggle to say what needs to be said without sounding like a jerk.",

But she goes to check my cervix, and she had a hard time even finding it at first!   It was still up high and towards the right, and she said that while it‚Äôs soft, it‚Äôs pretty much completely closed still. She was feeling for a divot because she was going to try to manually dilate a little bit, but she couldn‚Äôt even do that because it was still ‚Äòpinhole sized‚Äô.

So, due date was actually perfect because they were off of school for the 10th-14th, and it would‚Äôve given us optimal time before he had to go back.   Is there any tips for getting dilated naturally? I know everything can change really quickly, and baby‚Äôs gonna come when he‚Äôs ready, but I‚Äôm getting nervous!

    "self_text": "I wanted to write up my birth story for this sub because it was so helpful to me when pregnant, but I was always in the search bar looking for people talking about having fibroids while pregnant/delivering.  RIGHT before quarantine (we weren‚Äôt even wearing masks yet, just wondering if we should or not) my obgyn discovered a rather sizeable fibroid. At that same appointment we discussed wanting to get pregnant within the next 2 years and planned to address the fibroid before starting trying. My next appointment was last February (so 2 years later) and on a whim my obgyn gave me a pregnancy test, it was positive! My doctor said that sometimes fibroids move or shrink due to pregnancy hormones, so we will monitor it as we go. Spoiler alert: mine grew a lot and moved to completely block the birth canal. There was some light hope that I could deliver vaginally if I wanted that would fade with each ultrasound appointment. Also, when the fibroid grew the most during my 2nd trimester it hurt. I called the emergency line because the cramps were so painful. The doctors there said it was likely the fibroid growing or shrinking as long as it didn‚Äôt turn into contractions or started bleeding, I was fine to just take tylenol and use a heating pad or bath.  My doctor office has both obgyn and midwives. The way it‚Äôs set up is that pregnant women see all the midwives in rotation so you‚Äôre familiar with whomever is on call the day you go into labor. I too saw midwives after that first appointment and until my third trimester, when it was beyond definite that I would need a planned c-section. The last midwife I saw, right before my 3rd trimester, warned me that I was extremely high risk for pre-term labor and placental abruption. I was so anxious and spent a lot of time googling the symptoms of both, staring at the calendar, and googling time in nicu for each week along. The next appointment, in 2 weeks, I switched to an ob who said she disagreed that I was any higher risk of those things, I just had a higher fundal height because the fibroid was making the baby grow like a twin. It was such a huge relief to hear. In hindsight, I wish I had switched to an ob sooner. They see more high-risk births.   The c-section was scheduled for 39 weeks. Because of the fibroid‚Äôs size and placement, I had to have 2 obs scheduled for my surgery and was warned I may need a blood transfusion. On the day they added a 3rd ob because a final ultrasound showed it grew more.   I checked in at 6am for my 8am surgery. I started in a recovery room where 2 nurses asked me a lot of questions, drew my blood, then the primary ob came in, and the anesthesiologist. I was moved into the OR a little after 8. Everything started moving really fast there. The anesthesiologist inserted the spinal-but missed a few times which hurt. Apparently my spine is packed really tight and I had undiagnosed scoliosis. After that the anesthesiologist nurse and obs started testing to make sure I was numb. It was wild feeling. Like I could feel everything it just didn‚Äôt hurt or feel like anything but pressure. They brought in my husband which helped so much. He said it was crazy watching my body get kind of pushed around and stuff. I was like teeth chattering shaking the whole time. My baby was born at 9:09. Because of the fibroid, he never dropped so he was still breech and up by my ribs. When they took him out, they warned it would feel like a lot of pressure. That part didn‚Äôt bother me at all. They dropped the blue drape and pushed him against a clear drape so I could touch his tiny and and watch him scream. My husband went over to the warner where a ped team checked him out. It was very weird being left alone but then I got to do skin to skin for the rest of the surgery (except for a brief window where I got super nauseous. The anesthesiologist nurse was on it with anti-nausea IV and a bucket. After they finished, I was wheeled to recovery. I was weirdly anxious about the catheter removal but it didn‚Äôt feel like anything. From there I practiced wiggling my toes Kill Bill style.   Then we all got wheeled to our room for the next 3 days and 2 nights. Recovery has not been bad at all. The first night I was able to walk around the hospital floor and pee. I had diet and exercise controlled gestational diabetes which meant I had been walking 3x a day up to the day before birth. It also meant my baby had to have his sugar checked every 2 hours, so a lot of interruptions.   My baby is perfect despite hating sleep and loving nursing  too  much. He‚Äôs gorgeous and I‚Äôm so happy to have grateful to have an extra week with him.",

    "self_text": "I spent the weekend in a different hospital. Baby was diagnosed with growth restriction and me with too much amniotic fluid (think losing 20+lbs in fluid when my water broke, I blew up and looked like I was pregnant with triplets, I couldn't breath@)   Just under 2000 grams(1870, so 4lbs roughly), but since I didn't change over the few days I was there, they sent me home, told me to come back Monday for a growth ultrasound.  Told my husband that wasn't gonna happen. Also told him I didn't want to have the baby at home or in the car, lol they sent me home last night. I said I wanted a good night's sleep.  I lost my mucus plug all day in big gross chunks, and was grouchy, hungry, and packing my stuff. I felt fine.  I had a few cranky moments on the 2 hour drive to go out to dinner with him and kids before my 4pm dr apt. We had a good dinner, walked to the park, our oldest snarled at him for walking so fast and me walking too slow lol he kept having to stop for me.  Go to drs office. I tell him I have too much fluid and I can't breathe. He measures with ultrasound, agrees it's way to much, baby's so small. He goes to check me at 430 to decide what our options are, says he thinks I'm leaking fluid, finds out I'm 5cm... Pulls his hand out and epic movie like explosion, my water breaks like a fountain.   Due to risk of cord prolapse I have to stay on my back and he helps control the fluid so I don't have a cord issue. Once enough water has come out and baby is in a safe spot, he sends me to the hospital at 5. I have wads of papertowel that do nothing. I walk into the hospital gushing fluid like the movies. Or worse. A horror movie   I get upstairs at 520 and they want to transfer me, they don't do babies before 37 weeks. I laughed, I said check me. I was an 8. They said nevermind it's not an option. They get me into a room frantically, and less then 8 contractions later, he's out at 6pm.   I had like 5 contractions, asked him to check me, he says I'm a 9, he says don't push yet. 2 contractions later I say I can't help it, he's coming. I give birth standing up ü§£ pediatrician is mad at me because I told her to shut the hell up until I was done, after I asked her to stop talking nicely 3x first. She told me I was a disrespectful ass. Lol   I apologized after for being so rude, I just couldn't help it. I was one step away from throwing my flip flop at her if she hasn't shut up. I just needed 2 freaking minutes. Lol   They had to work on baby, but he stabilized with surfactant, no oxygen, he's doing good nursing. I bled too much because the female ob pulled out my placenta. My make ob had to manually massage a couple times and do pitocin, but I'm okay.   He can be with me during the day but observed at night for a few days. Once they decide the right combo of requirements we can go home.  I suspect he'll need bilirubin lights.   We are nursing successfully so far, his blood sugar is stable for now. Crossing fingers he surpasses expectations so we don't have to stay for too long.  Ok, that was all. Fast, hard, no meds, standing up, and husband didn't make it back in time while trying to park the car and older kids.   Just. Too. Fast.   From time my water broke, to baby was 90 minutes.",

I only have my circle's stories to go off of, and would love more perspective from other later-term pregnant folks who had to make this decision to keep waiting or induce‚Äîthanks in advance!",

    "self_text": "At the same time I became pregnant, I had to stop taking my sleeping medication (Ambien), which I had been on for many years due to a brain injury.   I had always figured that once I got off of Ambien, I would feel more well-rested during the day because the medication would not be circulating through my system.   However, since becoming pregnant and stopping the medication, I am needing about 16 hours of sleep a day and never feel fully rested. Even when I wake up in the morning (with no alarm) I am not fully rested and within 2 hours I am ready to go back to sleep.   I‚Äôm wondering, is this level of fatigue common during the first trimester or could something else be going on? I‚Äôm considering asking my doctor to refer me for an at-home sleep study to see if I have sleep apnea. (3/5 people in my family of origin have sleep apnea, no due to weight, so more likely due to anatomical structure.)   Any insight is much appreciated!",

I saw my OB yesterday for a check-up and baby is in the right position with his head down, but she said I need more Senkwehen (contractions which help to push baby's head down - couldn't find one specific word for this in English when I googled it). She said based on this fact, he probably won't come early, which is good to know, I guess, albeit a bit annoying üòÖ.  Before she examined me though, I mentioned to her that I have this pressing feeling in my lower womb, which I thought was his head, but apparently not. I'm curious how it will feel once he's lower down?  I also feel like something is permanently pressing on my bladder. Again, thought this was to do with how low down he is, but apparently not.  Can anyone shed any insights on the above? How did it feel for you? How long did it take for your baby's head to move further down?",

Normally, if someone has just smoked before they entered the bus it stinks, but the smell subsides within a few minutes. Not with these two.

    "self_text": "I am stressed out about an event I really shouldn't even have a part in lol.. Basically the dilemma is with all of the families mixing together. My dad is black and my mom is white. My boyfriend's family is Ecuadorian. Everyone has different cultures and ideas of that the baby shower is supposed to be like. The topic of discussion that's causing all the commotion is who gets invited to the shower; the full family or only women.  &#x200B;  My mom's side is all about only women for showers. Baby showers bridal showers all of that. When I brought this idea up to my dad and my boyfriend they looked at me like I was crazy. In their cultures, all parties are for everyone and just another celebration for the fam to gather for. So on top of all of the different types of people coming together, I have all these differentiating opinions about how it should be thrown. At this point I'm thinking of having them separately and letting each of the families do it their own way. Is that obnoxious? I just want to make it less stressful. Also if we have everyone all together, its close to 100 people. Ugh. Has anyone been in this spot before?",

    "self_text": "I had a miscarriage in my first pregnancy at the end of September. While we were sad, we were hopeful that I'd get pregnant again soon, as I'd gotten pregnant the first month we tried. After the miscarriage, I was waiting for my period, thinking that would be when my body would be ready to ovulate again.   But it never came! So i was getting very impatient and my doctor sent me for bloodwork to see where my HCG level was at, and scheduled me for an ultrasound to check on a spot they'd seen during the miscarriage. Imagine my shock when the bloodwork came back higher than it had been in the hospital when I miscarried. In the last 10 days I've had bloodwork 3 times, with the HCG doubling nicely, and yesterday was my ultrasound.   The tech confirmed that we were there to check on that spot, and I told her that I thought I might be pregnant again, but it was probably too early to see anything on the ultrasound. She did both abdominal and transvaginal and at the end, asked me if i'd like to see. I said yes, and she showed me a little tiny flashing spot - the heartbeat!   I'm 6 weeks 2 days and looking forward to surprising our families this Christmas with the news if all goes well!",

Just nausea and diarrhea. So naturally, being concerned, I called a health advice line as my OB is closed and while she was very nice, she was very unhelpful. She pretty much told me that I could have Listeria, or the stomach bug and I could have a miscarriage from it and to play it out and see how it goes. Well, that was great for my anxiety.   I am 12 weeks on Sunday, and I have a couple questions for you all. Has this ever happened to you? Was your baby fine? Does it sound like listeria, and how will I know? Is it safe to assume that if I have no bleeding or severe cramping that my baby is fine?   Sorry for asking a medical question, I did try to seek out help but I think this community has a wealth of knowledge. Thank you.",

Doctor proceeded with a TVUS. Curiously, the doctor had great difficulty in locating the potential gestational sac that was more clearly sighted in the TAS. Doctor scanned the uterus thoroughly, highlighting the potential gestational sac as outlined in TVUS2 scan image above.  Doctor continued to scan outside the uterus (in particular, left and right ovaries) and concluded that there was no visible ectopic pregnancy.  When the doctor came back to the uterus, the doctor focused on the potential identified gestational sac, and paused for a moment. Then the doctor says that she could potentially see a heartbeat, and true enough, when I looked, the screen was flickering. This flickering was not due to the grayscale effect of the ultrasound, rather it was a focused dot-like flicker. She seemed more certain that it was a intrauterine pregnancy after detecting the flickering.  However, the doctor remarked that it was unusual that it looked like there was a large white-ish structure within the potential gestational sac, relative to the size of the sac. She posited that the gestational sac was not being seen clearly in the TVUS due to the angle at which the sac was located within the uterus.  Doctor measures the potential sac at 5.7mm and remarked that the pregnancy was at 5w2d. However, ovulation most certainly happened on 7th or 8th October, so the gestational age considering the ovulation date was either 6w1d, or in the best scenario, 6w0d.  Doctor says to stop doing any further HCG tests and to submit to a follow up ultrasound within 7-10 days.    Questions:    Is it possible for a TAS to show a more clearly defined gestational sac (though empty) than a TVUS that locates it with greater difficulty / lesser certainty?  Is it possible to see a heartbeat flickering before seeing the development of the yolk sac / fetal pole?  Is it possible for visibility of the TVUS to be hampered by the angle / location of the gestational sac within the uterus?",

I have been having extreme panic attacks and emotional outbursts, and I feel like I'm going crazy. No treatments, either prescribed or homemade, are really working and I can't sleep/eat/etc.  On Saturday, we got into a fight over me having an emotional outburst (crying, and my husband yelled that he \"better be getting some extra stitches for putting up with this sh*t\". As in, he wanted the doctor to put in extra stitches after I deliver our child. I yelled at him to get out of our room and locked him out. He knocked on the door to be let in, because he needed to brush his teeth in our bathroom, but I slid it under the door and told him to leave me alone. It was a couple of hours before I let him back in, but after I did, he told me that I was being dramatic, and won't really speak to me except in passive-aggressive comments.  I don't know how to communicate why his comment hurt so much, and how to process this change in our relationship. I've tried to tell him that it hurt and apologize, but he refuses to speak in more than 3-word, sharp sentences. Does anyone have any advice or experience with this? Thank you.  tl,dr: I had a panic attack and my husband made a joke, so I locked him out of our room. After I let him back in, he won't speak to me and I don't know how to communicate through this with him.",

Im skeptical because it does not seem to be triggered by certain foods and i have tried tums and they dont seem to help. Though i actually wouldnt use ‚Äúpainful‚Äù as a word to describe the sensation. Its more like an odd/uncomfortable feeling in my throat. Starting from the base of my neck and sometimes getting pretty high up.",

Everyone is a genetic special snowflake, and your outcome may differ from mine. But I have talked to my psych NP (who apparently just quit so....), my gyn NP, and an OB doctor and have gotten conflicting statements from all of them. I'm also a nurse, and am at a total loss of what to do here. I'm really just looking to see if anyone else have experience with these meds while pregnant and any info you may have. I apologize for this being long, I have tried to shorten the post as much as possible.  Quick history: have treatment resistant major depressive disorder: I have been on 8 different meds and had TMS therapy. Finally on one that works, and have tried all the pregnancy approved antidepressants before. I have ADHD, anxiety, and some sleep problems. I take 30mg Buspar daily, 60mg adderall daily (though I have cut it down to 45mg), 40mg viibryd daily, 25mg trazadone nightly, and 25mg vistaril nightly.  My psych NP wanted me to get a second opinion, then a third opinion once the second opinion was nearly opposite of hers.   Psych Np said once I was pregnant I would need to stop viibryd, and try to decrease my adderall dose, but otherwise everything else should be fine. Gyn NP said Viibryd should be fine, but absolutely no adderall. She didn't mention anything about the other meds. OB doc said I have to stop Buspar, trazadone, viibryd, and decrease my adderall dose. When I told her about my medication history and conflicting advice on viibryd, she looked it up online and said \"you can keep taking it, but there is no guarantee about no birth defects.\" Needless to say, I'm not any more sure on what to do after that discBuspar?  I know vistaril is safe for pregnancy, and I have seen enough studies about adderall in pregnancy to feel confident in staying on it. But any personal experience on viibryd, trazadone, and buspar?

I am not against home birthing at all I think it‚Äôs a beautiful and powerful thing and any woman should be able to make the right choice for them selves.  But these people and accounts I follow don‚Äôt necessary advocate for ‚Äúnatural birth‚Äù they are more against the medical system.  All their posts make you fear going in for an indication, having cervix all checks, c-sections, that more things go wrong in hospitals than in home births, no need for a single ultrasound or Doppler and heaps more.  I read something once about someone saying ‚ÄúI watched this persons labour video and even though she said it was the best labour it would have been better if she was at home, you can‚Äôt beat that‚Äù  People also talk about giving birth at home like they are superior to people who give birth in a hospital. I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs a new trend‚Ä¶ *watch my raw and real birth‚Äù  And birth accounts sharing birth photos only sharing home births what about the beautiful hospital births?  I agree that there would be a lot of unnecessary intervention done in hospitals.  I believe woman should be able to ask questions and advocate for them selves but being in a hospital and having an induction or a c-section or lots of drugs doesn‚Äôt make a birth less beautiful or  raw    Im booked in for an induction and it upsets me to know people some people  think they have a better more beautiful experience because they did it naturally.  There‚Äôs no wrong or  more beautiful way  because you did it with out intervention.  Sometimes birth is traumatising and there will be a better experience which makes your next experience more beautiful compared to your first experience but don‚Äôt put others down for their seperate experience.

Thank you so much to everyone who has spent time reading and replying to this with your experience and views it‚Äôs very informative, educational and much more real compared to anything I‚Äôve seen on Instagram or TikTok.

Gaussian markers:  Level of Free BhCG 155.8 mlU/ml at 18/09/2022 : 5.2 MoM. (Truncated to 5 MoM in trisomy 21 Risk calculations.  Level of PAPP-A 22408 mlU/l at 18/09/2022: 5.73 MoM. (Truncated to 5 MoM in trisomy 21 Risk calculations).  LevelofNT 1.7 mm(CRLof 68.2mm):0.99MoM.  In a nut shell, they calculated it as low risk for Down, Edward and Patau syndrome.The doctor advised her to stop taking Inositol (Polysitol) from here.   Fast forward, Our second trimester ultrasound at 20 weeks 4 days report had the following 4 soft markers with intermediate risk for Down‚Äôs syndrome (Ratio 1:470)   Right and left choroid plexus - multiple cysts  Nasal bone - 4.6mm - hypoplastic  Left kidney - hydronephrosis   Heart - Multiple echogenic foci seen   Rest all are fine! The heart rate, weight, arteries, veins, nuchal fold, etc. Our daughter is still giving movements, especially after my wife eats something. The doc suggested us to choose between Amniocentesis and NIPT with more emphasis towards the former as we have more than 2 soft markers. Heartbroken, we chose Amniocentesis, and I am scared about the procedure as it seems to involve a needle to extract a sample from amniotic fluid. What if she moves in the process?! Also, has anyone heard about such markers? Do you folks think it is still possible to have a healthy baby? We are worried because our first baby was miscarried due to partial hydraditiform mole, and we have high hopes for the second one.  EDIT: We went with NIPT instead after some thinking.  EDIT 2: 29th November, 2022 (between 22 and 23 weeks) We went for the Advanced NIPT test 10 days back back and the results were as follows:   ‚ÄòLow risk‚Äô for trisomy 13, 18, 21, 9, 16, 22.  ‚ÄòNot detected‚Äô for chromosomal aneuploidies - X(XO), XXY, XXX and XYY   ‚ÄòNot detected‚Äô for microdeletions/duplications (60 types)   ‚ÄòNot detected‚Äô for incidental findings.    Insurance was not covered for this test. We are still worried about the soft markers on the 20th week ultrasound. The doctor asked us to wait and see if the markers resolve.",

    "self_text": "My Birth Story - So finally after 9 long months of a really tough pregnancy that included severe pre natal depression, HG , kidney stones attack, multiple infections and terrible pubic pain , I finally graduated 10 days back. I opted for an elective C section with general Anaesthesia (no guilt here) since I wasn‚Äôt mentally prepared to tolerate Normal labour pains. I also suffer from high anxiety. Also, the baby‚Äôs head was measuring big (all thanks to husbands genes) so there was high probability that even though I might have tried for normal, I would have ended up having c section later on. So, yeah. I am recovering okay and started walking from 2nd day itself. Although the post surgery pain was there for two days but manageable with medicines. Now that I am post 10 days , I feel it was the right decision for me. It made things so relaxed and easy for me.   I just want to say  what matters is whatever you choose, normal or c section, it‚Äôs perfectly okay. Whatever supports your mental health. I see a lot of people advocating for normal saying , this is how god made us to be, we should bear the pain and go the normal delivery route . I just want to say god and this nature is not perfect. God also originally made us to endure so many diseases and die early, only survival of the fittest. Didn‚Äôt mankind try to find cures for them ? Or did they just let it go saying , this is how god made us so so we should live this way? God also created us to live like nomads and hunt food ? But didn‚Äôt we upgrad ourselves? When it comes to women, it‚Äôs all about enduring pain and be strong but no , no & no, if you don‚Äôt want to, you shouldn‚Äôt endure just because of the default reason that we were born as a woman. Your life, your pain, your concerns are equally important.  You Go c section mamas.   Also, I wanted to post here since this group really helped me a lot to survive those 9 months.It was the only place  I felt heard & relatable and this is a wonderful place for pregnant woman .

I explained to her that I have a past history of trauma, so I would prefer to have an exclusively female team and she basically said that it‚Äôs most likely going to be all female with the slight possibility of a male laborist. And if I want to avoid that then I will need to schedule an induction on a day when only women are there. Personally, I am not interested in an induction or a C-section, I would prefer limited cervical checks.. basically as little medical intervention as possible, but I am thinking I will want an epidural.

    "self_text": "So I‚Äôm 26 weeks now and started overweight (roughly 100kg/200 lbs) into my first pregnancy.  I lost some weight (4kg/8lbs) early on due to nausea and have stagnated just under my pre-pregnancy weight ever since. Which, as I am already overweight, is not necessarily a big deal yet, but I literally don‚Äôt know how to eat more or get more calories even if I tried too.  My gynecologist did make note of my stagnating weight and seemed not too concerned yet - but some weight gain within the upcoming third trimester would be preferable.   The thing is, if I keep eating the way I am I don‚Äôt think I can pull it off.  I get uncomfortably full most times I eat and just end up feeling worse than before eating. The only way to up my calorie intake, that I can think of, would be by adding unhealthy foods such as sugary/fatty snacks or candy, which I guess is not a good idea either. I do currently add a little more oil/butter when cooking currently, or some more peanut butter into my cereal etc.   I am definitely not consciously restricting myself. But eating a bag of candy or chips or whatever against my will just for the sake of the calories seems unhealthy.  How do you guys balance eating healthy, eating enough and not feeling so awfully full all of the time? Did your ability to eat more pick up by itself later on in the pregnancy?  I would love to hear your experiences and input. Thank you!",

Ended up at 6 cm by 3 pm did stretches/movements to help everything along, by 5pm they manually broke my water hoping it would help my body go further in the active labor. Continued the stretches contractions got so bad I got an epidural so movements needed serious help from midwife and nurse because I was dead from the waist down lol.  The epidural scared me too, I thought my fiance would be able to stay and keep me calm but only Drs/nurses and I were allowed to be in the room during it...I cried a little because of that I'm not going to lie. The original numbing shit hurt like a mother fucker then the big needle came in, it originally went in too far to one side- he knew because I said my right toes felt tingly. He straightened out everything was fine from that point on, toes went numb immediately and my whole body was itchy for about 30 mins.  5 am comes around and everything but my dilation has progressed, baby's head is where it needs to be, 100% effaced but still only 6cm dilated. At this point the midwife tells me the pros and cons of continuing active labor given my water has been broken for 12 hours. I was looking at an increased chance of infection and hemorrhaging (there were other cons but these 2 we're the scariest). The pros were essentially that I still had the option to continue active labor but that definitely didn't outweigh the new cons.   I chose to have a C-section which was the scariest option for me but it went better than I thought it would. I sincerely didn't feel much while they were getting him out but sewing me back up was miserable. Throughout the whole process the anesthesiologist was amazing, she kept me loaded with nausea medicine whenever I asked and extra pain medicine when the pressure got to be too much.   In the end my boy was born, at 5:29am they told me there was no way I could have given birth to him vaginally he was too big, his poor head is coned and bruised because he tried to progress naturally. He's healthy and came out at 8lbs 9oz 21 inches long ü§ó",

For more context, I recently discovered/realized that he‚Äôs an alcoholic and have seen an extremely dark side of him that comes out when he drinks. I love him so much, and have told him in the past I‚Äôd stick with him through any hardships but this doesn‚Äôt seem like a healthy situation to bring a child into. I‚Äôve tried to talk to him about getting help (therapy, rehab, getting sober etc.) but he doesn‚Äôt seem to have accepted yet that it‚Äôs a problem.  At this point I know I want to leave but going through the rest of this pregnancy alone and being a single mom terrifies me.   This situation has already made me incredibly sad and I just want to hear from other women who have experienced pregnancy alone or are currently single mothers. Does it get easier? Were you happier once your baby was born?   (Please don‚Äôt judge me for wanting to leave him, I don‚Äôt want to go into detail of how dark and toxic he gets when drunk but just trust me when I say I know this is the best decision for me and my baby)",

    "self_text": "A little backstory. I‚Äôm ‚Äúold‚Äù (36) and my husband and I have been raising his 2 kids for the past 15 years. We are so blessed to have our families, truly. That said, this is my first pregnancy and our first ‚Äúours‚Äù baby. A result of a lot of prayer and intention. Nothing accidental about her and we are SO excited. I also find myself becoming increasingly recluse.   15 weeks until my due date and a lot of people continue to ask me about having a shower. If I‚Äôm honest about my dilemma, it‚Äôs because I have a very toxic SIL. She is extremely jealous and borderline obsessive, even before we were pregnant. She hates me but copies me, stalks my social media & got so pissed off I was kind to her last thanksgiving after all her crap talking that she WALKED OUT.  She completely skipped Christmas & repeatedly threatens to divorce my BIL, every argument they have, she ends up bringing me up even though I barely talk to my BIL anymore out of respect for her and despite him being one of my closest friends for 15 years. I‚Äôm no saint, but I try to always be kind and after 15 years of 2 HCBM‚Äôs, I‚Äôve gotten really good at letting crap go & not taking stuff personally.  Now that I‚Äôm pregnant, SIL is scorched earth. We delayed telling the family out of respect for her - she has some health issues and they have not gotten pregnant, but she wouldn‚Äôt see a doc. We told my BIL in advance, so he could tell her and make sure she knew exactly when we were telling everyone else out of respect for her feelings. I‚Äôve spent more time reading about how to be sensitive to someone struggling to get pregnant than I care to admit.   She made up some excuse not to come to my niece & nephews bday party bc she was made aware that at the very end, we were doing a very quick gender reveal. Literally a cannon pop for a picture and that was it. We waited until the end of the night so she could still come and leave if she wasn‚Äôt comfortable.  Instead, she didn‚Äôt come and called my MIL  during  the gender reveal to tell her she finally went to the doc. Anytime something has come up about our baby, she is no where to be found but somehow is this dark cloud overhead.  It pains me to feel no this way, I‚Äôve prayed about this so much, but ultimately I don‚Äôt want to have a shower because of her. I don‚Äôt want yet another event to be about her, even indirectly, when this is such a precious time in our lives. She treats my Sk‚Äôs different from the others and I worry how she is going to be when our baby girl arrives‚Ä¶ or if my baby girl is forever going to be her new scapegoat for all of her problems.  I‚Äôm at a loss, honestly. I don‚Äôt want to regret not having a shower, but I would also never exclude SIL. What would you do?",

There were a few who were neutral but one really stood out to me she had the meanest face the whole time she was there and when she would check me she always had an attitude. I stopped wearing a pad because I stopped bleeding and she said in a disgusted voice ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not wearing a pad?!‚Äù And I said no I mean why even ask when obviously there‚Äôs no pad there and no bloodüòí. The next nurse which was my discharge nurse saw the same thing and in a completely different tone said ‚Äúoh great you don‚Äôt need a pad anymore! You‚Äôre  strong momma!‚Äù Also one of the nurses told me that if I felt a lump in my boobs to call them so they can check and make sure everything is okay I did notice a bump and I called the nurses but it was when the mean nurse was there she looked so annoyed when I asked if they can be checked as if it was a stupid question. She said it was completely normal and if I want to slow down my milk production to wear something very tight. Which was the opposite of what the last nurse told me. Idk am I being too sensitive because I was vulnerable? Or am I being a Karen lol",

I know y'all were concerned, but some of the advice really helped!  First off, we found out that we're pregnant with fraternal twins about 2 weeks ago, and after our first counseling session, we went to our 14-week ultrasound appointment. And... we're having girls! We chose our names last night over a game of Uno and some chicken enchilada soup, and since I can't tell my family, I'd love to tell you guys...  We decided on Eden Maribelle and Hazel (\"Hattie\") Vivian, and they are due May 12th (due date changed since twin discovery)! We are so excited for them, and as a May baby myself, I'm so excited to have a girl-filled spring :). I'm secretly hoping that they come on Mother's day, as I did when I was born.  We talked with the help of a counselor and learned a lot about each other's feelings in this tough time. Communication was always great before the HG diagnosis and complications, so I knew we could make progress to get back to that state. I discovered that the reason he had been so hostile and closed-off is that he was worried about the pregnancy and the possibility of losing me and/or the baby. He told me that his mother had a miscarriage at around 5 months with a sister that his family was really looking forward to. Although I had heard about this miscarriage before, I was not aware of how hard it was on his family. He told me that was the primary reason that his parents divorced, and with my husband being 16 at the time, that was incredibly difficult for him. We had been dating at that point, and I knew of the divorce and of the miscarriage at the time, but we weren't really open enough to talk about the stress he was under. I've also FINALLY started a medication that works, after a lot of y'all recommended it!  Learning all of this and being able to communicate with a third party in the room was wonderful, and I am so grateful for all the advice I received recommending this! My husband promised to come for the rest of my appointments, and we are working on using \"I-statements\" and having productive before-bed talks. We have another counseling appointment for Friday :).  Thank you so much! <3",

    "self_text": "A new study from the University of Texas in San Antonio examined growth, development, and brain function of the rat offspring after prenatal buprenorphine.  A few thoughts on dosing. If a 70 kg person takes 8 ‚Äì 24 mg of buprenorphine, that would be 0.11 to 0.34 mg/kg. The dose used here was only a bit higher, 1.0 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally. Rat pregnancy lasts only 20 days and they administered the opioids from gestational day 10 until 20. This is fairly short and since baby rats are born very more immature, is roughly similar to only the second trimester of human pregnancy.   The offspring exposed to buprenorphine prenatally showed small but statistically significant reductions in body weight after weaning.  When they were tested as adults, they showed learning deficits in a type of classical conditioning, the prepulse inhibition test. The researchers conducted electrophysiology and identified abnormalities in the function of the dopamine neurotransmitter system. Perhaps more striking was that brain weights were also significantly smaller when they were adults.  The study was published in the journal eNeuro which has a very respectable impact factor (4.4).   Anyone have any thoughts on why this study isn‚Äôt getting more attention?   Citation   Elam HB, et al.

I‚Äôm hoping someone here can help me understand but I also am going to talk to my actual OB at my next appointment on the 28th   So for history sake, this MFM told me that last pregnancy I was falsely diagnosed to chronic hypertension (which the Ob who diagnosed me didn‚Äôt even treat me for) & that I actually had gestational hypertension that turned into preeclampsia.   My Bp is ALWAYS elevated or high (average 130-140s/80-90s) in the OB office. At my last primary care appointment in June my bp was PERFECT, 118/74! My OB had me start taking my Bp at home & on average it sits at 117/80 which is NOT chronic hypertension, right? My OB is very happy with these numbers   Anyway, after my scan was over MFM came in & right away said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to treat you for chronic hypertension.‚Äù Which then I tell her what my OB has said, how my bp has been at home, & that it was normal at my pcp back in June so why am I being diagnosed with chronic hypertension?   She basically said she believes I do have chronic hypertension. Which I just don‚Äôt get because 117/80 isn‚Äôt high bp!   She then said with the diagnosis of chronic hypertension that they can prescribe me bp meds if I‚Äôm at/over 140/90 but without that diagnosis they can‚Äôt, she said with gestational hypertension they can‚Äôt treat with medication which confused me. She also said that recommendation for gestational hypertension is delivery at 37 weeks while controlled chronic hypertension is 37-39 weeks.   She said after pregnancy it‚Äôs up to my PCP to decide if he wants to keep the diagnosis for me or not.   Of course she brought up my high BMI, which I completely understand does put me at higher risk, but I feel like if my BMI was normal she wouldn‚Äôt have diagnosed that.   She said because of the diagnosis of chronic hypertension she can go ahead & schedule growth scans for every 4 weeks, plus weekly nst starting at 32 weeks.   I understand better safe then sorry, but I don‚Äôt understand how I can be diagnosed with something that my PCP & OB have both said I don‚Äôt have‚Ä¶I feel like I‚Äôm failing my child.

We found out we are having a little girl which is amazing news. The radiologist reviewed the results and let us know that she thinks our baby might have clubbed feet. She doesn‚Äôt know with 100% certainty because of the way the baby was sitting it was difficult to fully see the feet but she felt confident enough that she wants us to see a maternal fetal medicine doctor to have an ultrasound done to confirm. We can‚Äôt have it done until 12/15 which is an entire month of waiting and feeling anxious and stressed about the situation. On top of not knowing for sure and now just having to wait a month for an appointment to be sure one way or another. I know this isn‚Äôt a horrible diagnosis and that people get much worse but I‚Äôve already cried about it three times thinking about our baby having to wear casts on it‚Äôs legs for the first 8 weeks of it‚Äôs life and then be in a brace 24/7 for the next few months. I just know it will be horribly uncomfortable for her having her legs stuck and basically not be able to move them freely for the first few months of her life. And then having to wear the brace at bedtime until she is at least four. It‚Äôs just a lot to take in and knowing how hard having an infant is in the first place I know this will make it much more difficult on both us and the baby. Just hoping for some advice on how to handle this mentally and get through the next few weeks of waiting.

Are there any good online resources for thyroid issues while pregnant? I had blood work done a few weeks back (11/4) while in the ER for dizziness. They determined it was vertigo and that was it, I have been fine ever since. I had a follow up a few days later with my OB and they said everything looked fine and nothing to worry about. I just got a phone call from my PCP about and hour ago saying they got my report from the ER and we‚Äôre concerned because my thyroid TSH levels were 6.2 and had anyone talked to me about it. No one at the ER said anything to me about my levels being high and the OB didn‚Äôt mention anything in my follow up. I just called my OB and spoke to the nurse and she basically said that although they got the results from the ER before my follow up appointment it didn‚Äôt look like anyone had actually looked at the report! This is totally unbelievable to me that they would have a follow up with me but not look at the results from the ER besides the fact that everything I can find about increased TSH levels during pregnancy carries all these extra risks so it seems so careless that they didn‚Äôt see this and start to treat it right away. So now they want me to see an endocrinologist to follow up about the results and I‚Äôm in full panic mode. To my knowledge I‚Äôve never had a thyroid issue before and it was basically luck that I had to go to the ER and they found this. Basically anything you google tells you how much more risk you are for miscarriage and all these issues and almost everything out there is just from studies but doesn‚Äôt give a lot of readable information. Are there any good resources out there for me to look at while I wait to have my appointment? Does anyone have any experience with this?",

Although we didn‚Äôt say not to post anything, my partner and I didn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd have to.  However, she posted that she was going to be a grandma on Facebook.  Because of this, people we were keeping the news from found out.  My partner asked her to take it down and she said it was already up so ‚Äúdeal with it.‚Äù  I miscarried and we went to a party a couple weeks later and I had to deal with strangers coming up to me congratulating me and I was so depressed that I didn‚Äôt have the energy to explain what happened.  I had the miscarriage and then she asked me to grab lunch a couple months later.  The first thing she said when she got in my car was that she had gone to a lovely baby shower recently for my partner‚Äôs ex gf.  I kind of let it roll off my back.  A few weeks ago we had a family dinner scheduled for her mother‚Äôs birthday at a restaurant.  She hounded my partner and I all day to make sure we were going and then a half hour before, texted me that she couldn‚Äôt make it.  When I asked her why, she said she had to be the labor and delivery coach for her ‚Äúfriend.‚Äù  When I asked her what friend (because obviously she‚Äôs an older woman), she said my partner‚Äôs ex.  Apparently the ex‚Äôs mother passed away and the baby‚Äôs father and her separated right before her due date.  My partner told me that that is just how his mother is and unfortunately she‚Äôs going to be the one suffering in the future because we are not going to let her spend a lot of time with our daughter.  He said he‚Äôs gotten used to the way she is a long time ago and that he loves her, he just does not like her.  Anyway, I‚Äôm now 6 months pregnant.  We have not told her yet.  And I found out from my partner‚Äôs brother that she has been sleeping over the ex‚Äôs house to help her with the baby and even let her borrow her car last week.  I just find this wildly inappropriate and disloyal but my partner says she has carried on relationships with a couple of his ex‚Äôs in the past.  How do I handle this??",

However, I have high TSH 6.5 and low level of vit D 23. I'm taking vitamins and vit D included like twice of the dose.  I worry more about TSH. I had a light hypoterios, but the level increased after pregnancy. I don't have levotyroxin treatment.  My next appointment is in the end of the month. Should I worry about TSH level or it's not super critical? BTW, t4 is good.  Thank you in advance for your opinion.",

    "self_text": "Yesterday I went in for my growth scan at 35w5d. It was the first time we had seen the baby via ultrasound in 12 weeks. I‚Äôve had regular appointments the whole pregnancy and never had a single issue up until yesterday. Almost immediately once the tech started I noticed the GA on the measurements were all coming up small and began to feel uneasy. The tech said baby is measuring small overall with an estimated weight of 5lbs 4 oz. We then went to our appointment with the doctor who said baby was measuring 15th percentile. She wasn‚Äôt worried. When I mentioned he measured 65th-ish percentile at 20 and 23 weeks, she said that‚Äôs not ideal but she still wasn‚Äôt concerned. I of course was. I came home and read all about babies measuring small and looked back at the notes from my anatomy scans and really started to worry when I saw baby‚Äôs abdomen was at the 74th percentile 12 weeks ago and was now at the 16th. I laid awake worrying last night and that was my sign to call my doctor this morning to ask about additional monitoring. When I called the nurse pulled the doctor in to look a little closer at the measurements yesterday (she hasn‚Äôt had a chance to review yet) and said the doctor is not happy with that sharp of a drop. Blood flow and fluid all looked good and heart rate was perfect at 132 and since we‚Äôre not below the 10th percentile I don‚Äôt have an IUGR diagnosis which is all good news. But now I‚Äôll be doing weekly NSTs until baby is here and probably being hyper-vigilant/obsessive about movement. Baby has some quiet days but I‚Äôve never had a problem getting to 10 kicks when I notice a quiet period. Overall I‚Äôm really starting to worry and trying not to. Any advice or similar experiences? My husband and I are not small nor were we small babies so my head is going straight to an issue with the placenta or some other reason I can‚Äôt sustain him.",

Additionally with general inflation, I feel like fresh produce tends to sit on the shelf longer, and thus gets moldy much quicker if not used right away (like‚Ä¶ same day use). I stopped buying strawberries because every single time I would get home with them, I would find that tucked inside, out of sight if just looking through the package, there would be several white or grey fuzzy berries, and that would be the literal day I brought them home. I bought a melon that I had for two whole days before getting around to cutting it and it was already totally squishy and slimy brown on the bottom. I‚Äôm sad now because I sprung for the expensive blueberries when we went shopping on Thursday, and got one of the ‚Äúfreshest‚Äù packs that were literally just sat out that day, and there was one in the middle of the package that was moldy, less than two days in our fridge! I throw out the moldy ones and inspect the rest, make sure they feel/look/smell fine and wash them off really good before eating them. Like I‚Äôm trying to eat healthy and make nutritious meals but then sometimes I just get in my head over it and would just rather have pre-packaged, processed snacks that I know aren‚Äôt moldy (though; I did recently open a fresh pack of crackers and they were all totally stale!), or just heat up a frozen snack or meal. Is anyone else noticing that ‚Äúfresh‚Äù produce is like, anything but fresh? Not for long anyway. Also - I am shopping at my local Publix, which tends to have fresher produce as compared to say, Walmart or Winndixie.

I‚Äôm always thinking about my husband dying in a terrible accident and when I‚Äôm home alone all day I‚Äôm paranoid that someone will try to break in. I am aware these are slightly irrational and I don‚Äôt let it bother me too much. However, yesterday I was visiting my parents and their small dog ran out the front straight into the road. It was pitch black outside and there were cars coming from both directions. I love this dog so without hesitation I ran after her, all 7 months pregnant of me. I started screaming at cars to stop waving them down. This is not new, this dog has gotten out like this before and I‚Äôve chased after her before. But this was the first time I was doing it pregnant and at night. This was also the first time she came inches close to being hit. A car sped up as she dashed across the road, my first instinct was to jump out in front of it, wholly believing she would be hit otherwise. Luckily the car saw me and the dog didn‚Äôt get hit, but I ended up peeing all over myself realizing the danger I had just put myself in as well. I‚Äôve been a mess of panic attacks and crying since. Usually this wouldn‚Äôt be so hard to deal with, no one got hurt and everything is all right. But being pregnant, this made my anxiety skyrocket and those few moments of stress are going to have me struggling this whole week. I don‚Äôt even feel like getting out of bed today. Anyway, I wanted to rant on here because I‚Äôm sure all of us expecting mammas are experiencing anxiety and I wanted to feel a little less alone.",

    "title": "Graduated! Emergency C-section at 35 weeks went better than expected. Mother and baby‚Äôs first week after birth were harder to endure.",
    "self_text": "I‚Äôm a 37 year old FTM. What I wanted was a low-intervention vaginal birth of a healthy baby, and an immediate start to our breastfeeding journey.   These desires came from genuinely wanting ‚Äúthe best‚Äù for the baby, but I also  have a history of medical trauma (like waking up during surgery as a child, among other experiences.) So the thought of a c-section was a bit terrifying, and being ‚Äúhooked up‚Äù to a breast pump made me squeamish.  At our 32 week ultrasound, my baby was diagnosed with IUGR, with his measurements at or below 5th percentile. So we began a regimen of NSTs, Doppler, and ultrasounds, and each of these appointments had the potential of sending us to L&D. The plan was to wait for his 36 week growth ultrasound to determine whether he‚Äôd grow better out, than in. We hoped he‚Äôd move into position by then, in case we had to induce at 37 or 39 weeks.  At 34 weeks, I was sent to L&D for observation, because the NST was measuring my contractions as unusually strong and frequent. (I told them I‚Äôd felt these for a few weeks already, and that I had assumed Braxton Hicks contractions just felt worse than anybody admitted.) After hours of no/minimum changes in dilation (less than 2 cm) I was released to go home.   At 35 weeks and 2 days, I woke up as my water was breaking at about 3:15 am. Very soon after, the contractions increased in intensity, to the degree I couldn‚Äôt talk through them while on the phone to L&D, so they advised me to come on in. The contractions escalated further, so it took about 45 minutes to get me off the floor, dressed, and into the car with frequent breaks for breathing through the pain. We got to L&D around 4:30.   At my first cervical check of that morning, I was 90% effaced and two centimeters dilated. The baby was frank breech at this point, and there was no option of turning him anymore because there was no amniotic fluid to cushion him. I had no choice but to have a c-section.   I was going to have a C-section for my early, tiny baby.  Not what I wanted at all.  Within an hour, I had dilated to 7 cm and the contractions literally brought me to my knees on the exam room floor.   It finally occurred to me to remind my doctors that I had been warned to expect a precipitous labor due to family history and my connective tissue disorder. At that point, I was rushed to surgery with urgency. They wasted no time, doing the epidural and cleaning the surgical site even before my husband had time to get prepped to enter the operating room.  I could not have asked for a better experience with the epidural. Insertion was remarkably painless, and it worked quickly and thoroughly. The vibe in the operating room was positive and calm, and I quickly found myself surrendering to this complete departure from what I had hoped for. I felt so unexpectedly calm through the surgery that I asked what drug was making me feel this way. The anesthesiologist said to me, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt take credit for that, it‚Äôs all you.‚Äù  When my baby was born, I did not hear him cry, but my husband encouraged me, saying his eyes were open and he was moving. They rushed him out of the OR to warm him and improve his breathing. My husband and I had agreed in advance that if mother and child were separated, he would go with the baby. So it was of course hard to endure more of the surgery without my husband or my child; but, they returned pretty soon, and then I held my son on my chest while my husband beamed happily at us both.  His time of birth was noted as 6:14 am‚Ä¶ so about 3 hours passed between my water breaking and his birth. He weighed just over 5 pounds, and measured less than 17 inches long. For preemies, his measurements were in the smaller end of average. Compared to full-term babies, he was smaller than the 1st percentile.  We had a few hours together, during which his temperature and blood sugar levels were borderline-to-low. Then, he aspirated a dose of glucose and quickly turned blue, terrifying us and sending into the room the pediatrician and what felt like a whole flock of other care providers looking serious and grim. His doctor said this was the final indicator that he needed more care than he could get in the regular wards. He was taken to the NICU, ‚Äúfor as few as four hours of observation‚Ä¶‚Äù  It was a full week before we could bring him home after that.  The general consensus while in the NICU was that he was just not developed enough to self-regulate his respiration, temperature, and blood sugar- which made sense given his gestational age. His smaller body and lack of body fat also contributed.   It was a two-steps-forward, one-step-back journey toward his release from the NICU. The treatments, uncertainty, and cycle of hope and disappointment, were all heart and gut wrenching.  My own recovery probably suffered from my stress and frequent trips to the NICU, which often made me late for my doses of Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen. My pain never got below about a 4 on the pain scale (except under rescue doses of oxycodone) and spiked to about 6-8 pretty often that first week.  Two days after my release from the hospital, I fell behind on my regular medication (due to a combination of exhaustion, visiting the NICU, trying to pump every 2 hours, etc) and my 35 pound dog also stepped on me, just below my rib cage.  My pain escalated over the course of the night, eventually getting worse than even my contractions at 7 cm dilated.  We rushed to L&D where they were very thorough and kind, even arranging for me to pump so I could keep my supply up. They ruled out any complications; I just needed more pain management. I was sent home (after a nap and pain medication) with enough oxycodone to feel like I could take it as needed.  Since then I‚Äôve been slowly improving. My baby is more vigorous each day, but we‚Äôve been unsuccessful in breastfeeding so far. I grateful for the care we both received, and am delighted to be home with him.  I hope this incredibly long post is at least somewhat helpful to one of you!",

Except like two days in, this pregnancy is already kicking my ass harder than the first one.   I‚Äôve felt like an insane person for two weeks - major anxiety, a constant desire to break down and cry, feelings of dread, and surges of anger in response to small irritations. At least all that makes sense now. For 36 hours after finding out, I was in a total euphoria - happy about the baby, massively relieved I wasn‚Äôt like, having a mental breakdown. The hormones are real yall.   But ever since finding out I am already in the throes of morning sickness and I feel like such a whiner - a faker even - bc I am barely pregnant. Like not even 5 weeks along. I feel guilty like I‚Äôm playing everything up bc I now have an excuse.   I know I‚Äôm not! I genuinely feel like shit man. Why do I care if it ‚Äúlooks‚Äù that way? A thing no one has actually said?  It doesn‚Äôt help that I have a cold (i got one very near the start of my first pregnancy too?) so I have constant thick drainage setting off my already sensitive gag reflex. I think I was even nauseous before I found out and chalked that and the lack of appetite up to my incredibly sore throat. Now my throat is better but I feel sicker.   I hate tummy upset - hate it.  I want to start crying again. I‚Äôve been up for almost two hours since before 5 and nothing has helped the feeling ease so I can get more sleep. I have a 10 hour shift in another 1.5 hours.   The tools that I‚Äôd normally use to help with nausea are shut off to me as a pregnant lady. I‚Äôm dreaming of the Zofran I had when I got COVID of all things.   I won‚Äôt see my OB until I‚Äôm 8-10 weeks and I‚Äôm almost positive they couldn‚Äôt do anything anyway. So I‚Äôm just laying here on the sofa miserable and reminding myself it‚Äôs going to get a lot worse. I haven‚Äôt even actually vomited yet.   Last time, I did have a little sickness but it came and went periodically in little mild bursts. This constant sick feeling is so draining. And on top of fatigue which I also have. And hunger bc I can‚Äôt get anything down. So now the gnawing hunger is exacerbating the nausea and I know I need to eat bc it‚Äôs not just about me anymore and now I‚Äôm crying again.   I don‚Äôt want to work today and I‚Äôm so spoiled bc I do call center work from home. ü•≤  I want this baby so much but I‚Äôm also so scared of losing/changing my bond with my first. She‚Äôs almost 3 and she still cosleeps with us. I should be sleeping next to her right now. It‚Äôs like all my fears about the second child taking away from her are already coming true.   35 more weeks. Ooooh, 33 if this one comes Johnny-on-the-spot like my first.",

As of Thursday everything was fine, just possibly an irritated cervix. It continued and I made sure to keep my doc updated. My spotting was letting up, but I had my maternity shoot yesterday and there was a bit of walking and light exercise involved to get to the photo sites, poses, etc. Early this morning my spotting increased in amount and bloodiness and I went to L&D again. After being strapped to monitors, blood work done, ultrasound, cervical exam, and answering a ton of questions the BLEEDING STOPPED. Because of course it would  after  I'd gone through everything üòÖ Baby is fine, I'm fine, not even dilated yet. I was discharged, got myself some consolation donuts, and headed home.  Among this latest development I've also been pooping way more for a couple weeks now and having Braxton Hicks much more in the last few weeks. They even got to see a few on the monitors today. I've also had random huge bursts of energy that I've spent cleaning and organizing and I've been feeling much more grouchy/mama bear-like when it comes to people in my space. And the spotting started up again a little bit ago.   I know all of these could mean imminent baby-having or they could mean nothing at all and I'll make it to my due date or beyond. I can't help but feeling like it's the former though. I've been mentally and emotionally preparing for this baby to come and I am feeling very zen about going into labor/giving birth. Am I crazy to feel like that's going to be sooner than later?  I guess I'm just looking for any kind words from you mamas about how labor started for you. What were your early signs weeks, a few days or even just before?",

I am completely losing it at the time because I think something is very wrong. I get the ultrasound done and NST done. Baby is happy but my placenta is making too much pressure. They book me again for another NST and Ultrasound for tomorrow. To make matters worse my MIL was near death from battling cancer. She had assisted death scheduled for last Thursday which she went through with and is now gone. Her cremation is tomorrow and so is my second hospital ultrasound and NST.   I feel baby is ok, I do kick counts 3 times a day and asked them to reschedule my ultrasound and NST for Tuesday. I‚Äôm just completely emotionally drained and MIL‚Äôs cremation is tomorrow and I don‚Äôt think I could mentally handle a hospital appointment. I am also aware that my baby has to come first.

What are your thoughts? I am trying to view both sides, but a pregnant woman wants to eat what she wants lol.  FYI- I am 22 weeks pregnant and baby is healthy per doctor visits, bloodwork tests, and ultrasounds.  Edit: Appreciate everyone‚Äôs feedbacks and perspectives! Husband ended up getting me an Italian hoagie, which as I said would only eat half. I do want to mention that we aren‚Äôt going to ‚Äúban‚Äù this relative as she is one of our closest relatives. We both want the relative to be in our child‚Äôs life, but we would definitely speak to our pediatrician to figure out what is considered an appropriate age for the relative to visit the baby.

We live together, love each other, and are very set on a future together. We‚Äôve discussed kids and agreed we both want them. We were kind of in the mindset of whatever happens happens. Ideally we would have liked to start a family in 2 years. I know my AMH is very low, and I may have possible endometriosis. I‚Äôve wanted nothing more than to be a mother my whole life, so I was a little scared to wait.  I found out I was pregnant yesterday and felt like a huge weight was lifted from me.

I‚Äôm super worried about money, work, being a good enough mother. Am I doing the right thing here? Should I be waiting till I‚Äôm married? That doesn‚Äôt really matter to me, but will it matter to my baby? Should I wait until I‚Äôm in a better situation financially?  I know some form of anxiety is normal, but do I have too much? Is it there because I should be listening to it? Am I letting the happiness cloud my judgement, or am I letting the anxiety cloud my judgement?   I know I can only answer these questions for myself. Im not looking for anyone here to answer them for me. I guess I‚Äôm just looking to see if this is normal. Did anyone who wanted children but didn‚Äôt necessarily plan this feel this way?

For example, relating their body image issues/weight concerns with my changing body. ‚ÄúUgh I can‚Äôt lose this weight, at least you have an excuse!‚Äù Which in itself is problematic for many reasons (fat phobia, societal expectations etc) but can we please not pretend that our experiences are the same?

I am 38 weeks and was advised to be monitored after a change in movement pattern. Following some scans they have advised that baby isn't putting on as much weight as they'd expect (15g a day instead of 20g) and they have booked me in to be induced in just under a weeks time - when I'll be 38+6. I'll be monitored every day until then and will have a scan in 2 days to check blood flow through the cord and placenta.  This has very unexpectedly brought back all the trauma from the rape and I can't stop thinking about it. I really don't want to have the internal examinations or pessary inserted and I just don't know what to do. On one hand I obviously want to do what is best for baby, but on the other I know how traumatic I am going to find this. I feel like I have been robbed of a positive birth, it makes my planned water birth much less likely.

I just needed to rant for just a second to people that understand my pain. This might be a long post but here we go.  This pregnancy has been AWFUL. I took a test at 6 DPO because I am impatient and got a positive. Not even a week later I am puking my guts out 25+ times a day. My OB says it‚Äôs just bad morning sickness even though by 9 weeks I am down 20lbs and have been in the ER multiple times to get IV fluids. I go through 4 or 5 different nausea medicines and none of them touch how sick I am. Eventually I get diagnosed with hyperemisis and my paramedic sister comes to give me IV fluids every other day. This extreme nausea lasts until I‚Äôm 19 weeks along, and gradually subsides into plain ole food aversions. Even food in commercials makes me nauseated.   At 20 weeks I notice my heart is acting super weird. My resting heart rate while sitting on the couch hits 165bpm.   Along with my racing heart I start having panic attacks that my doctor gives me more pills for, but I can‚Äôt take them because they just knock me out and I have a 2 year old to take care of.  Two weeks into that bullshit and I wake up with my right boob swollen and so painful that I am having trouble speaking through the pain. I get told it‚Äôs a clogged duct that is close to turning into prenatal mastitis and I am instructed to do warm compresses and massage. I cried through both from the pain.  My tiddy eventually clears up and I get a week long break until today.  I woke up with UTI and bladder infection symptoms. I am so uncomfortable and can‚Äôt get any rest because I am getting up to pee literally every 5-10 minutes.   I have 12 weeks left until my due date and I have never been more ready to be done in my entire life.  If you made it this far, thanks for listening to my whining. Everyone around me has been helpful but I just feel like they don‚Äôt fully grasp how miserable this has been. I keep getting told ‚Äúwell you wanted another baby‚Äù and someone is going to get throat punched the next time I hear that.  TL;DR. I‚Äôve had Hyperemisis, tachycardia, panic attacks, a clogged milk duct and now a UTI/bladder infection and I‚Äôm only 27.5 weeks along. Sos.",

The day we found out, I started reading every pregnancy book I could get my hands on. I have been watching educational videos everyday too. My wife, on the other hand, has taken the 'ignorance is bliss' approach. She says she just wants to relax & get by knowing as little as possible. Basically, stay on auto-pilot & hand the wheel to her OBGYN, mother, MIL, & The Universe. For context :   Her OBGYN is a family friend & there is a lot of trust there with how she has handled previous pregnancies in our circles  We live with my parents (we're Indian) & they share a great equation with my wife. She says if she needs/wants/doesn't know something, she'll just go to my mom. Her parents live a short drive away, to her own mother too stays available.   While I appreciate having all these wonderful women around my wife during this time, this feels absolutely bonkers! I tried talking to her about it.. She eventually gave me 'the look' & I backed right off. Bothering her is the last thing I want right now. I talked to her OBGYN, who dismissed it like no biggie. I got our mothers together & talked to them. They say women have babies without fancy medical assistance everyday. I'm just being an anxious millennial. Again, no biggie.  WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FUUUUUCK???? Am I crazy or is everyone around me crazy???? How is she going to make informed decisions without even properly knowing what's going on inside her?? What if something goes wrong?? What if something happens to her when I'm not around or we're not in our city?? It's 2022 & the love of my life wants to live like Tarzan, on an uncharted adventure not knowing what all might or might not happen with every next step. She's such an independent, inquisitive, strong-headed, opinionated, well-read woman. I have never seen her act like this!  Is this normal/common for a pregnant woman to chose to do that? Am I overthinking this or do I start getting two people's worth of gestational education now?",

    "title": "Positive Home birth story with minor complications at 40+2",
    "self_text": "ETA some context: this was my third baby, first home birth. My eldest was a hospital induction with epidural, second was unmedicated at a birth center, and this has been my favorite birth so far.   Bloody show is always my sign that labor is coming or my contractions are ‚Äúreal‚Äù and I first saw it at 3am the day after my due date. I tried to go back to sleep, but got up to start packing my older kids‚Äô bags to go to my mom‚Äôs at about 4. Husband and kids got up at 6 when contractions were ~15min apart but regular (my contraction pattern is very atypical).  I let my midwife know I was in early labor at about 8am, then my husband and I got down to business setting up the birth pool, cleaning, and spending the day together. It honestly felt like a date, and we were in high spirits, watching TV and chatting between contractions.   Midwife came around 6:30pm and was surprised to see that I was 7cm dilated, stretching to complete during each contraction, which were coming about 10min apart. I was still coping well, making jokes or resting between contractions while the midwife and her assistant did puzzles and knit at the dining table, waiting.   Around 1:30am, the contractions were getting more intense, so I got in the shower while we waited for the birth pool to fill up. I got in around 2, and labored there until the water got too cool for the birth, and I could feel myself starting to push, so we over to the bedroom. At this point, I was a little tired for laboring almost 24 hours, but still feeling great and excited that it was almost go time. Contractions now 6min apart.   Things took a turn here. I felt this indescribable pain right above my pubic bone with every contraction, and my body stopped trying to push. I would attempt to push anyway, but couldn‚Äôt handle the pain. This was weird, because up until this point I had been coping extremely well. After a few more contractions, I was hysterical and telling my midwife that something was wrong. She felt around and decided that baby may have gotten stuck trying to descend under my pubic bone and was instead hanging  over  it, causing my pain. She got me in the shower and had her assistant get behind me and physically pull (more like yank) my belly up and back during a contraction. I screamed, but it worked. I felt immense relief and the contractions went from being supernaturally painful to just ‚Äúregular‚Äù labor painful. I got back up on the bed and started holding my belly up and back while I pushed just to make sure he stayed in the right position, and finally I started to make progress. Contractions 3min apart. Now ~4:30am.   When I felt like I could no longer push on my back, we moved to a lunging position on the floor where I had one knee on the floor, one knee up, and my arms around my husband in front of me for support. I pushed until my water exploded on my husband, then things ramped up and the ejection reflex took over, but he wasn‚Äôt descending as quickly as expected. I felt his head come out, then pause. My midwife‚Äôs voice changed, and she told me we needed to change positions as she moved my legs to open my pelvis more. I immediately knew something was wrong, so I pushed as hard as I could until he was finally born at 6:34am. The time between his head being born and his body coming out was about a minute and a half. He took some vigorous rubbing from a towel to cry, but was otherwise just fine. My husband held him while my midwife delivered the placenta and stopped my bleeding with pitocin. I did hemorrhage, but it was easily controlled with the medication, and she stitched my 2nd degree tear while I nursed the baby.   Later, I learned that her tone changed because she noticed the baby having trouble turning so his body could be born. I didn‚Äôt feel it, but she reached in and felt that his shoulder was flared out, so she gently repositioned it with two fingers before I got him out on the next push. He was also my biggest baby at 8lb 12oz, which is probably why he had a harder time coming down into the birth canal.   Overall, even though the end was hectic and intense, I am really happy with this labor and delivery. At no point did I feel fear because my midwife was competent and made me feel safe and cared for, and she resolved the mild shoulder dystocia so quickly and efficiently that my husband didn‚Äôt even notice there was anything wrong until we told him afterwards. It was the absolute best feeling to climb into bed and go straight to sleep after they made sure everyone was stable, cleaned everything up and left, and this has been my easiest postpartum recovery despite the most severe tearing and hemorrhaging. Baby is doing great and surpassed birth weight at 4 days old.   Feel free to AMA about home birth, home birth prenatal/postpartum care, unmedicated birth, whatever! I know there‚Äôs not a ton of home birth stories on this sub, so it‚Äôs hard to get an idea of what it might be like if you‚Äôre considering one or just curious about it.",

    "self_text": "Hey, I think I‚Äôm in need of advice, encouragement or maybe some ‚Äúsnap out of it‚Äù? I‚Äôm a few days overdue and I‚Äôm in a cast from breaking my ankle 2,5w ago. Ever since I learned the ankle was broken and that I will need a cast for 6w I have been kind of miserable, and I feel bad about it. I‚Äôm obviously dying to meet my little baby, but the ankle situation has gotten me down. The situation = I have already gone from ~130 to 175lbs, and have to hop around on crutches which is exhausting. Within the house it‚Äôs manageable except I can‚Äôt carry anything other than in a backpack, and I can‚Äôt do any housework hardly, which also makes me feel like shit, even if of course my partner is more than happy to support but I can see that he is tired after work. Going for OBGYN appointments totally drain my energy, having to carry all this extra weight, but I think not being outside catching sun has also not helped. No balcony and we live without an elevator, in a city.   The bigger problem will occur when she‚Äôs born and I won‚Äôt be able to carry her or even stand up to rock her, since I‚Äôll still be in a cast for her first 2-4w.  Has anybody been in this situation and can you please share your positive experiences? Is it ‚Äútrue‚Äù in your experience that you spend most of the time in bed those first few weeks anyway, so it won‚Äôt matter much? Is it ‚Äúnormal‚Äù to feel this unhappy, this close to the birth? I‚Äôm not miserable ALL the time but you get it.. also,  baby is healthy and I‚Äôm healthy (foot aside) so I know it could be A LOT worse.   Thanks for your understanding xoxo",

    "self_text": "Currently 36w6 and am wondering if I'm having contractions or just a strange stomach ache. This is my first baby so I'm not sure what to expect. I always assumed they would feel like period cramps and be in my lower uterus area (like period cramps) and although I have been having those more frequently the last few days, right now and probably for the last hour I've been having the strangest stomach pains. It's like if someone were pushing on my stomach from the top and sides, it is very uncomfortable. Comes and goes. I did have an appointment with my doctor this morning and baby was at -2 station, no dialiation yet but she said my cervix is definitely thinning. Could these be contractions and could they be from having a cervical check today? Is it more that I need to use the restroom and just am not ready yet so it's giving me stomach pains? I really don't know! Could you describe your contractions to me??? Thank you!",

    "self_text": "I wanted to post this here to hear everyone‚Äôs thoughts.. especially people who have been through a similar situation. At my 20 week scan, they said my baby girl had an abnormally small head (6th percentile) and femur (6th percentile). Everything else looks great; she is petite, but that‚Äôs no surprise, as I am quite petite and my husband is small as well. She measured at 18 weeks 5 days, torso at 30th percentile and weight at around 10 oz. Her organs & cord look perfect, as well as my placenta and the amniotic fluid. My midwife says she is showing all the signs of a  well-nourished, well-hydrated baby. She is also very active in the womb. Now my midwives are slightly concerned about the small head; I went in for blood work (painstakingly waiting for the results now) for various viral and bacterial infections, which would be shocking if I have. I have had a very healthy pregnancy except for getting covid at 6 weeks. I have an ultrasound booked for 22 weeks to redo the measurements with a different sonographer. I am hoping and praying that she is perfectly fine, and maybe she had a growth spurt in the body and her head is catching up now. She is also head down and was moving her head (almost looked like she was saying ‚Äúno‚Äù repeatedly) during the ultrasound, so perhaps their measurements were off. Any guidance/thoughts/reassurance for you all? I am trying to have a calm, peaceful, hopeful attitude towards this‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want any stress to affect her. But of course, my heart feels so heavy and I feel sick to my stomach. Just finished crying about it. Thank you all so much for any responses you may have.",

I guess I'm just hoping other mums to be can commiserate and provide some reassurance that I'm not alone in this. I had no idea it would be this difficult, nobody ever talks about how hard pregnancy can be....Thank you all in advance.",

    "self_text": "Hey everyone. I know I said I would post an update yesterday, but honestly that was the furthest thing from my mind when we found out everything. It's very mixed news. Her cisterna magna is measuring at 9.5 mm and at 10 mm is when they would diagnose her with dandy walker or something similar (they didn't say what else it could mean). They also found out she has a cyst in her brain measuring at 4-5 mm. They are concerned but hopeful. She is borderline and the cyst poses a risk as well. They said as long as it doesn't grow that most likely she'll be fine, but now I have been referred to an MFM and we'll be getting regular ultrasounds to monitor both issues. They did tell me if she does have dandy walker or other issues with too much fluid in her brain that they can implant a shunt which will hopefully prevent her from having any neurological issues. I just want my baby girl to be happy and healthy, and knowing she might struggle through most aspects of life has me spiraling. My husband said this is good news and that she's fine for now and I swear I'm trying to focus on that, but why doesn't he understand that I am beyond scared for her and that things could change dramatically over .5 mm? Plus on top of all of that he is saying maybe we shouldn't have any more kids because of how hard this pregnancy has been on me and with the possible complications our daughter might be having. When before we both wanted to have two kids. I feel like I'm losing everything and like I have no control. I'm lost, scared, and feeling so alone.

My OB and I don‚Äôt gel and I‚Äôm always very stressed out when I‚Äôm about to see her, she only ever takes one reading too. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs normal, I‚Äôve heard to double check when it seems a bit higher. I take three readings at home each time, morning and night and my BP is in perfectly normal range. Ive tried moving OBs but it would be impossible at this point, she is the only OB in my town I would have to go to another town which isn‚Äôt in the cards for me now. Is there anything I can do at home to ensure my blood pressure lowers so I can give birth vaginally without any problems? I‚Äôm trying to avoid induction which is what she said will most likely happen at 39weeks. I really want to try and do it my way unless there‚Äôs a medical reason not to.",

I have been growing her for 38 weeks. Is that not part of the bonding experience? I‚Äôll have the rest of my life to bond with her; so why do I need to breastfeed or endure excessive pain for an unnecessary extended period of time? Do people even hear themselves when they speak such foolishness?",

My wife wanted to have the night before to talk about the pregnancy with her mom before my parents come over the next day.

Of course he wants to be there during the birth, but he‚Äôs asked me a few questions that clue me into how he‚Äôs feeling like ‚Äò Is it bad if I don‚Äôt look at your vagina during birth‚Äô and ‚Äò I want to hold your hand but is it ok if I‚Äôm sitting next to you instead of standing?‚Äô  Non of this offends me- because to be honest I get it. I know he‚Äôs going to be all over our daughter once she‚Äôs born and beg me to hold her all the time- and that‚Äôs all that matters to me.   My mother will be there and she‚Äôs a helpful Karen when she needs to be. So I already have someone that was built to whether the storm if shit hits the fan.

I say its my first \"real\" ultrasound because at 6 weeks I was having some bleeding and cramping and went to the ER on my OB's advice to get checked out. They did an ultrasound but I was so early all i could see was the gestational sac and yolk, but heartbeat and embryo were too small to see yet. I have to admit as the official ultrasound gets closer i'm both super excited and INSANELY nervous.  It's so easy to worry. Am I still pregnant? Did I miscarry without realizing? Am I carrying a dead baby right now? I try to keep reminding myself that I FEEL pregnant. All of my physical symptoms have been relatively mild and easy to get through, but constant. Exhaustion, super sore and massive boobs, a bit of nausea, bloating an constipation, etc. But The month before this pregnancy i was also pregnant and had a super early miscarriage at 5 weeks, so it's really easy to worry.   But at the same time i'm SO EXCITED. I can't wait to see their little heartbeat and shape of their little head. I'm picking my husband up from work to come with me so we can share the moment together. I think the pregnancy is a bit more real for me than him since i'm actually feeling it every day, but this is going to make it feel so real for both of us. And its comforting for me to know he will be there with me in case something is wrong.   No idea what i'm looking for here, just needed to vent out the complex combo of extreme excitement and worry I am feeling right now. I just wish i could jump forward to Thursday morning already!",

    "self_text": "Hey all! I really enjoyed reading these so I thought I'd post my experience. I had a scheduled c-section 11/1 because my baby was breech and I had gestational hypertension. I was horribly nervous leading up to the procedure. I had very much wanted a VBAC.   It was pretty traumatic despite my research and preparation. They had a really hard time placing the IV; they tried in my hand and I almost passed out... the babies heart rate dropped and they had to pause. It took three separate tries and they hit valves every time. I'm wearing pretty bad bruises still from the failed attempts. The nurse who took it out said that they did a horrible job with placement and thats why all the fluids and medications hurt so badly when they administered them.   The spinal... oof. My OB said that if I felt any \"zinging\" on one side or another to let the anesthesiologist know. It was not zinging. It was a horrific stabbing pain that I pretty much fell off the table with. I started sobbing because it was terrifying, the nurse held me and they continued on. Finally, it was placed and they laid me down. I started to feel sick, which they warned me about and the anesthesiologist gave me some medication. My heart rate dropped and so did my blood pressure and I got the worst headache I've ever had. They had to give me fentenayl while I sobbed like a baby. Finally everything stabilized and they brought my fianc√© in. The c-section part was actually not bad I kept thinking wow its so weird that I want to move my legs but I can't. I've read a lot of posts where people said the pressure and tugging was awful but it wasn't too bad for me. After I heard my baby crying I calmed down a lot. Holding him and sharing that moment with my fianc√© was a life highlight!  Some things I would like to pass on... the first 24 hours the baby probably isn't gonna be super excited about feeding. I thought we'd be cluster feeding off the bat but that didn't really hit until night two. I'm still having trouble getting the baby to latch because of my nipples. I brought shields in preparation and was very glad because we needed them. A lot of babies need them initially. The nurses helped us with latching initially because we needed to try a few different positions.   Everyone's pain levels are different, mine wasn't too bad and I was up and moving within 6 hours. The cramping from pumping was worse than the c-section. Speaking of, bring your pump to help the milk come in if you are breastfeeding. Push to see the lactation consultant as soon as you can. I saw one twice and got good advice but I will say you get some conflicting opinions.   Also, this is hospital dependant but we saw about 15 different nurses during the course of our two day stay. We really had to advocate for ourselves if we needed something. Sometimes my Tylenol came off schedule and we had to bug them to bring it to us, for example. We had some awesome nurses and some less than awesome ones. We know they are over-worked but we really had to push for help when we needed it. Also, the care can be somewhat de-humanizing and the stomach massages are quite excruciating.  Finally, I just want to say how grateful I was for my fianc√©. He took care of everything I needed and the baby too. He's a great dad and watching him change every dirty diaper, help me get in and out of bed, shower, etc was truly a reaffirmation of our partnership. Make sure your support person is prepped to help you because that truly made everything bearable. Also, having a little human has been such an amazing blessing despite all the sleep deprivation.   I wish all you ladies the best of luck on the rest of your journey's! It's scary but so worth it!",

Our respective families are understandably excited about the pregnancy (it is the first grand child on both sides + we had an 18 week loss this year).   Anyways, last night I was talking to my SIL and she asked if her parents had shared their plans with us. I said no and she explained that her parents want to come stay with us about two weeks before the baby gets here and that my MIL would like to stay an additional couple of weeks afterwards to help out.  I really don‚Äôt want this. We don‚Äôt even have a second bed for them to sleep in. The second bedroom is a nursery.

Additionally, I don‚Äôt really want anyone in our apartment immediately after birth.

They haven‚Äôt shared their plans with us yet, but this is really stressing me out. I would much prefer if people waited a bit before coming to visit us (maybe once he has his shots?).

At my last OB appointment, my doc got pulled away into delivery and I saw a NP instead. Totally fine! But when I mentioned that I was still taking Zofran at 20 weeks due to continuous, uncontrolled vomiting, she was super skeptical. ‚ÄúWhy have you been taking it this long? It hasn‚Äôt gotten better for you yet?‚Äù No ma‚Äôam, sure hasn‚Äôt. The ER trip just last month for dehydration and hyperemesis is kind of indicative of that, but I figured she was just a new practitioner trying to get as much info as possible.

During this time, I‚Äôll spend my birthday and Thanksgiving here, and possibly Christmas. Baby will also go to the NICU after, and I‚Äôm worried about spending all of my maternity leave at the hospital with baby and not getting any time to establish any home life and routine together before I go back to work. I worry this will negatively impact our start together and make me feel inadequate as a FTM.   Please tell me I can do this. This came on very suddenly at a routine prenatal appointment when there were zero signs or symptoms at the appt two weeks prior. I went from planning on returning to work after lunch and working for two more months- to driving directly to the hospital instead. There‚Äôs still much to be done, baby showers I can‚Äôt physically attend now, we cancelled my 30th birthday party this weekend. There was just so much that was supposed to happen before baby got here. And now I‚Äôm on bed rest and have to leave everything to everyone else; but I still have a full time job of trying to stay calm and keep my BP down for baby.

I was looking to see if this is a thing, and it looks like it is recommended by ACOG if you have multiple moderate or one severe risk factor for preeclampsia. Their summary is here. This is my second pregnancy, no complications with the last, my BMI is healthy, and I've never had any issues related to blood pressure, kidney disease, or any high risk factor. My only risk factor is a moderate on, and it's that I am at AMA, barely, at 36.  I just kind of feel uneasy about the situation with all other recommendations pointing towards avoiding NSAIDS during pregnancy for many different reasons that I've found, including uncertainty if there is a link between their use and intellectual disability in children, as in some studies say yes, but more evidence is warranted.  Have any of you been instructed to take baby aspirin for just AMA?  How would your proceed? I have a really good relationship with my midwife, as she delivered my last baby, but I rarely feel the need to question any recommendation she gives.  Am I just being overly skeptical? I'm just trying to weight my risks, as my midwife said there would be no risk at all in taking it. I just don't fully buy it.",

When I got to the hospital I wasn‚Äôt dilated or contracting but they admitted me. After a few hours in our room I was checked again and was 1-2cm dilated and 80% effaced. They started me on pitocin to help speed things up. I was hesitant but agreed and I‚Äôm glad I did! Once we got into the evening my contractions were getting pretty painful so I got a couple of doses of nubane as the night went on. Epidural came around 11-11:30pm and I was able to get a short nap in. When I woke up I was feeling a lot of pressure down low in my butt, it literally felt like I had a massive poop sitting there ready to come out. I let the nurse know that I thought it was almost time to push and when the midwife came in to check she confirmed it was time.  I started pushing between 1-1:15am on 11/07 and my beautiful baby girl was born at 1:52am. I cried as they put her on me and soaked up every moment of that golden hour. I ended up with two small tears, one near my urethra and another on my labia but did not need any stitches! I could not have asked for a better experience or care team and I feel extremely fortunate for that. My fianc√© was amazing and supportive as well. Honestly I was terrified and didn‚Äôt know what to expect but I‚Äôm so grateful for this journey and experience, especially as I sit here at home snuggling my healthy LO.  Thank you to everyone for all of the support throughout my pregnancy and I wish each and every one of you the best of luck on all of your pregnancies, deliveries, and beyond!

My stools have been unusually light in color for the last few days, and I have been having severe nausea since the weekend, all of which points to cholestasis according to the internet (i know, I know, doctor google). I called and left a message on my nurses line but they are not open yet so it will be a couple of hours before I hear from some one.   Has anyone been diagnosed with this or suspected they had it later in pregnancy? What was the protocol? From what I can tell early delivery around 37-38 weeks is recommended but it can take a week or more for test results to come back, especially during the holidays, and I'm already halfway through my 36th week. This has me so scared for my baby.",

The escitalopram I took for only two days because I was having a major depressive episode and did research seeing that SSRIs are mostly safe during pregnancy. It was an old prescription. The worst part about it is now my physician is going to think I‚Äôm self medicating. I‚Äôm a psych nurse practitioner student and am just thoroughly shocked at the falsifying of records.

Initially, we wanted to give ourselves at least a two-week grace period to settle in but with reports that things seem to be getting worse, we're now thinking we should wait until at least the first set of vaccines and, even then, limit physical contact with the baby. A number of our friends have already signed up to provide us with meals the first month after our due-date and I want to make sure they have a realistic expectation that just because they are bringing a meal over doesn't mean we will be comfortable introducing them to the baby quite yet.

The silver lining here is that if I don't end up with an emergency c-sec due to this placenta problem and it's risks then I will be induced at some point. I'm still trying to talk my doctor into a planned section but this is maritime canada so I'm not getting anywhere...  Sorry for rambling. I'm just scared. Googling the condition has only made it worse. üò™   Please let me know if anyone has more positive stories about this.",

    "self_text": "Just an off my chest/rant post really and a bit of a salty biased one at that . Hubby and I are living with my parents while our house gets built. I'm 37 weeks tomorrow with first baby. While hubby doesn't have a bad relationship with his parents, he's not particularly close with them because they've always been much more supportive of his brother than with him (for whatever reason they saw more \"potential\" in his big brother and supported this academically and financially while the boys were growing up). They're now realising that their younger son might be just as talented in his own way now that he's lived with a family and wife that support his goals and encouraged him to work for his ambitions.  We've been low contact with them throughout this pregnancy - I was technically high risk throughout and did not expect to make it to full term and they told others we were expecting before we were ready to disclose ourselves. FIL is also, to put it politely, \"old fashioned\" in his views on gender and, despite me working in a higher earning, higher educated field and more career oriented than my husband, does not agree with my returning to work after having this bub.   All that to say we had MIL over to have a light lunch with my mother and I today and she just WOULD NOT LEAVE. I am suuuuper concerned about boundaries now. She arrived at 10am and did not leave until 4pm and I am exhausted. Both mum and I did the polite \"oh you'll want to leave before school traffic\", \"won't your husband be wondering where you're at now?\" and hubby even came from an appointment and left for work during that time and still she did not go. We got \"oh it's just so calming and relaxing here, I don't want to leave\". As if my parents house was a day spa!  We're keeping gender a secret and thank god I'd bought some clothes for my friend pregnant with the opposite gender because she went through the drawers of our nursery! I don't even like looking through friend's fridges for my own drinks after I've been invited to! I've also got unsolicited, unsafe advice such as the gem of \"oh we drove older son home in a bassinet on the back seat in a car with no seat belts so you've spent way too much on that capsule love\". üëå  I am 100% going to be leaving it to hubby to kick them out but we're having them both over for Christmas (my parents idea but cold lunch only!!!!) and I am already dreading having a fresh newborn and MIL and FIL all up in my business while I'm trying to learn to breastfeed and alone time is already at a premium. What if they don't leave!?!",

So excited but scared  Update: had baby at 7:59 pm 11/11/22. Came in they checked to see if my water had broke took a sample than gave me an Iv. After that it was just a waiting game I didn‚Äôt really feel my contractions but than I wanted to go pee and as soon as I stood up contractions where coming like crazy. I decided to get an epidural. And of course it was only working on my left side. Didn‚Äôt hurt like I thought it would just a pinch. Took two hours for it to get to my right side. Then they put a catheter in. By this time it‚Äôs like 7ish and one doctor said it looks like I‚Äôm ready to push. Gave it about 10-15 good pushes and bam I had my baby in my arms. He immediately wrapped his little fingers around mine. While I was holding him they pushed my placenta out checked on baby. Then they started to push on my belly. Tbh that hurt more than anything she said my uterus was weirdly low?? And this nurse has nails she was like digging in my belly button. It took all my strength not to push her hands away. They came in to push on my stomach a couple more times. Baby is doing great with breast feeding. And let me tell you the first pee stings sooo bad. But lucky it doesn‚Äôt last long. Now I‚Äôm just watching him sleep. I hope for a fast and healthy delivery for everyone!",

We've already received and set it up.  Then today my husband's childhood friend offered us their twice used Snoo. Insistent that we have it and it will be life changing. I never even considered the Snoo because of the price and it seemed unnecessary. But now with the prospect of a free one I'm tempted.   We are living in my MILs ADU so space is a bit limited until we move into our house next fall. So having 2 is not really feasible. I know we're incredibly lucky to be in this \"dilemma\". Any one try the Snoo or have used both and have advice? I'm leaning towards just declining the Snoo, I'm sure they have other friends that will make use of it.",

We‚Äôve had three hospital stays and I even had a laparoscopy to physically look at the uterus because they thought I had an interstitial or corneal ectopic pregnancy. They told me so many times that termination would be the only treatment plan and here we are at 11 weeks and now they‚Äôre saying it looks okay the baby is just on the left side of my uterus instead of being in the middle but they believe that it is an inter uterine pregnancy and viable. They said they found a small subchorionic hemorrhage behind the placenta and I‚Äôve had to do my own research on it. It was light spotting here and there with some light cramps but then this morning it turned into period like bleeding and I even passed larger clots. I thought maybe I passed the SCH and everything would be fine but I‚Äôm still bleeding like a period and when I tried to call everyone passed me around. The on call nurse told me to see my OB in the next three days to check up. I‚Äôm seeing high risk OB‚Äôs at the moment until they clear me from high risk. The lady for the high risk doctors yelled at me telling me how many appointments they have and saying that they cannot get me in and that if I have an issue I shouldn‚Äôt bother them and I need to go to the OB triage (the ER for pregnancy). This will be the 4th time being in the ER and it‚Äôs a ways away from where I live. So I‚Äôm asking the internet instead because clearly no one wants to answer my questions. Is this increase in bleeding normal with a SCH? I‚Äôve had no pain even when passing the small clots. I feel fine no light headedness or fever. Little to no pain and still experiencing nausea from the pregnancy. Help :(   I‚Äôm sorry this post is so long",

No brown discharge during wiping but while sitting on the toilet, my stomach felt weird. Like cramps but gas pains at the same time. Did have 2 bowel movements during this time.

My stomach was tense from shivering as well. I started to calm down and feel ok about 45ish mins to almost an hour later. Again, I didn‚Äôt see anymore brown discharge after the first two wipes.

It also goes into the ways that the breastfeeding relationship aids in postpartum recovery and things like assisting the baby to regulate outside the womb and begin to develop their circadian rhythm. Reading this might help someone who is unsure about their birth plan and help to make informed decisions for themselves and their baby.   The introduction: ‚ÄúThis report synthesizes evidence about innate hormonally-mediated physiologic processes in women and fetuses/newborns during childbearing, and possible impacts of common maternity care practices and interventions on these processes, focusing on four hormone systems that are consequential for childbearing. Core hormonal physiology principles reveal profound interconnections between mothers and babies, among hormone systems, and from pregnancy through to the postpartum and newborn pe- riods. Overall, consistent and coherent evidence from physiologic understandings and human and animal studies finds that the innate hormonal physiology of childbearing has significant benefits for mothers and babies. Such hormonally-mediated benefits may extend into the future through optimization of breastfeeding and maternal-infant attachment. A growing body of research finds that common maternity care interventions may disturb hormonal processes, reduce their benefits, and create new challenges. Developmental and epigenetic effects are biologically plausible but poorly studied. The perspective of hormonal physiology adds new considerations for benefit-harm assessments in maternity care, and sug- gests new research priorities, including consistently measuring crucial hormonally-mediated outcomes that are frequently overlooked. Current understanding suggests that safely avoiding unneeded maternity care interventions would be wise, as supported by the Precautionary Principle. Promoting, supporting, and protecting physiologic childbearing, as far as safely possible in each situation, is a low-technology health and wellness approach to the care of childbearing women and their fetuses/newborns that is applicable in almost all maternity care settings.‚Äù  https://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/resources/health-care/maternity/hormonal-physiology-of-childbearing.pdf",

I've been successfully decreasing my use even though I'm not where I want to be this far along at 19 weeks my doctors have been so supportive about \"you're using less that's good that's all we care about that you're stopping.\" Its made it so much easier that they dont try to shame me. I went from a juul pod a day and now I take a hit of my sisters vape a couple times a day. It's not perfect but working in daycare I have a hard time with withdrawals because I lose patience with the kids. My husband saw me hit my sisters vape after 5 hours without a hit and said \"for someone quitting your hitting that vape a lot\" I hit it twice and walked away and the way he said it made me want to use more, not less. I was frustrated. I didnt use more but man does it make it harder not easier.   I only have access to a vape when I cross paths with my sister so only a couple times a day. This trick helped a lot. Idk I see so much stuff about how terrible expecting mothers are for using and it's hard because I'm trying to do a balancing act of not getting bad withdrawals that would hurt the baby but decreasing at the same time.   Just if you're struggling to do the balancing act I just want to say if you're using less that's what's important. Even if you're not where you want to be keep working, dont let people get you down, dont let them make you want to use more from stress if you're doing it good job, I'm so happy for you and you're baby. You're doing it and that's all that matters.",

    "self_text": "Hi beautiful pregnant people! It‚Äôs finally time to get a pregnancy pillow and I‚Äôm looking for advice. My doctor said I can‚Äôt sleep on my back anymore and that‚Äôs all my body knows how to do.  I lie on my side, sandwiched between two pillows, only to wake up on my back with numb legs a couple hours later.  If I exaggerate the side position some more, I end up sleeping on my belly. Then my belly hurts because it‚Äôs squashed, and my back and neck ache because of the torsion.  I think I need something long enough to put my top leg fully on top of, to avoid hip pain (which I‚Äôve had since before pregnancy because of misalignment and closed hips ‚Äî PT recommends anything to keep my legs separated).  I feel like the classic U or C shaped pillows will just let me melt in between and cuddle on my back. I‚Äôm pretty thin and small so I think I‚Äôd just slip through the crack if that makes sense. I need something that will hold me in place and force me to be on my side.  Any tips, favorites, or what did or didn‚Äôt work would be appreciated! I don‚Äôt have a huge budget or space to try out all the options.",

Over the past couple days I've noticed I've had more vaginal discharge (not mucus plug, and not a TON of it, but just different than normal for me).   Then Thursday my husband and I went for a 30 min walk, I got a couple period-like dull achey (VERY mild) cramps. One on the way back from our walk, and another a couple hours later.   Friday I wasn't as active, so I think maybe I felt a period cramp like once during the whole day. But last night I woke up to a mild period cramp at 1am and 3ish, and I'm getting another now at 9am.   I haven't felt or seen any mucus plug/water release but I know that doesn't mean much either yet.   Edit: also got a migraine for the first time since the first trimester yesterday. (I don't think preeclampsia bc it's only on one side of my head and I have no swelling in my face/hands and my BP is fine)  Is any of this a sign of super early labor?",

No regrets here though!   I do have some thoughts to share, now that I‚Äôve been a parent for a whole week and a half.    The newborn bubble is pure magic. Embrace it and reject anything that tries to pop that bubble. Babies, especially newborns, make everything special.   For those that fear having to set boundaries with family/friends/anyone, it gets so much easier to say ‚Äúno‚Äù after you see your LO‚Äôs face and know you are all they have to protect them.   For partners, help make a plan for nighttime feeds/changes. That way, everyone gets more sleep. For example, when it‚Äôs time to feed, I change LO‚Äôs diaper, while my husband gets the bottle and my pump parts from the kitchen, he feeds her while I pump, he puts her back to bed, I store the pumped milk, do any necessary feeding cleanup and head back to bed. This process gets faster and more efficient each night.   Don‚Äôt be afraid to reach out for help. Whether it‚Äôs help with the baby or you need help with your mental health, ask for help. PPD/PPA/Baby Blues are extremely common and you can‚Äôt be the best parent for baby if you are suffering.

I usually see my OB or a nurse midwife and my experiences have been very good.  I went in for my 32 week appointment and saw a different provider (ARNP.) I'm considered high risk primarily due to my anxiety during pregnancy (OB has me on Lexapro which has helped A LOT) but I am also obese according to my BMI. I'm 5'1\" so I basically have to maintain the weight I was at 14 years old for the rest of my life to ever fall into \"normal\" range, but my general health has always been excellent and this pregnancy (my second) has been pretty textbook.  I had wanted to discuss feeling dizzy, headache-y, and the fact that my baby is still measuring large at this appointment. I'm anemic and was wondering if upping my iron would help. But she kind of blew me off, just said \"Well, your blood pressure is normal and baby isn't  that  big\" and then went on to focus entirely on my weight.  She told me I'm well above the recommended weight gain and asked me what my \"problem foods\" were: \"Are carbs your thing? Sugary food? Some women think you have to 'eat for two\".\" I told her I hadn't had much by way of cravings and wasn't really eating differently than I had pre-pregnancy; if anything I'veeaten healthier. She kept pushing, like, \"C'mon, you can tell me.\" She told me to get more exercise (I have bad SPD but am managing a 30 minute walk each day, which I told her).  It just really rubbed me the wrong way. Especially when I saw my after-visit chart: my blood pressure, which she blew off, was in the early \"high\" range and definitely higher than my usual. I've monitored it since and it has been back to normal, so not too worried, but also, I've only gained 11 pounds during this whole pregnancy. That's well within and even below normal, even for someone obese, especially since the baby is already estimated at 5 lbs at 32 weeks. Wtf.",

Like the aching feeling you feel in your arms and legs after doing exercise, but this time in my groin area.  I thought it might have been from the walk, although I don't know why. I think it was now just a coincidence, as I still have it a week later. I know that my body is preparing itself for the birth. Is it due to that? Does anyone know what's going on? üòÖ It's not a stabbing pain or anything, it's like a constant ache.",

    "self_text": "Hi pregnant folks! 22 weeks FTM here.  I had blood in my urine today. I was obviously very concerned. I‚Äôve had bad UTIs before and I know how dangerous they can be. However, I had a full urine checkup and culture this week, which came back clear, and have no symptoms of a UTI, so my OB wasn‚Äôt concerned. Apparently, I probably hurt my bladder during mild exercise.  Timeline and symptoms: I went for a rather fast paced walk around noon, followed by general abdominal pain, followed by bloody urine, which is now clearing out in the evening after rest. I couldn‚Äôt pinpoint one source of pain, and think I had a combination of aches: muscle pain, round ligament, GI stress, and some uterine cramps, along with my bladder getting squashed.  What I think happened: I think during the walk the weight of my uterus bouncing on my bladder must have caused some sort of injury somewhere in my urinary tract. That‚Äôs the explanation that makes the most sense right now.  My OB recommended rest and water, and some pre approved meds to calm down potential gas/reflux pain. ER if I don‚Äôt feel better. I do feel better now, and the urine is clearing up. It‚Äôs almost back to normal now.  Has anyone else had a similar experience? Is this just another ‚Äúweird pregnancy thing‚Äù that just happens rarely? I trust my OB, and I feel fine, but I had never heard of this sort of thing. Or is Google right and I have kidney cancer?",

My boyfriend and I recently moved to a new state and got new jobs here. This pregnancy was a surprise and not planned at all, but we do want children. Just not where we're living right now and we aren't exactly financially prepared for this. We don't have any friends or family in the area to help once the baby is born. I work as a server and also started a wfh job just recently, but it's commission-based pay & I haven't made a single sale yet, it's very discouraging. My boyfriend is unemployed and looking for a new job. I feel such a lack of stability and have been having panic attacks feeling unsure if we will be able to keep the baby or put it up for adoption. I have health insurance through the state, which is very helpful. But I will not qualify for any kind of maternity leave as I haven't worked either job for over a year. I don't know how to make this work with no help and an uncertain future with my boyfriend having a job.  |  I have had some serious conversations with my boyfriend about getting a job. (He has a history of not keeping jobs well) If he isn't able to get one by the time the baby comes, I have a back-up plan, but I don't want it to get to that point. I will have no other choice but to move in with my sister after baby is born, and she lives about 15 hours away. I don't know how to make this work with no one for support and without another person having an income. We both want to keep this baby if possible, and our relationship is great other than the financial issues.  | I guess I'm looking to hear how others made this all work, any single moms out there or anyone struggling financially who found a way to make it work? And I would appreciate any tips on how to go about things after baby is born considering I don't have maternity leave/when did everyone go back to work?

I've had UTIs a lot before pregnancy and this time I didn't even know I had one, no symptoms whatsoever.   Im feeling pretty exhausted today and sick but just assumed normal pregnancy symptoms.  What's worrying me is them saying URGENT and her mentioned its in her hands right now ready for me to collect and take to the pharmacy.

    "title": "I‚Äôm not okay with my scheduled c-section and I don‚Äôt know how to deal with it.",
    "self_text": "Some background: I‚Äôm a STM and my first pregnancy ended in an emergency c-section due to fetal distress. The experience was traumatic and I‚Äôve never been able to come to terms with how it all went down. I had wanted a natural childbirth but I experienced back labor that was unbearable and ended up opting for an epidural, and everything kinda went down hill from there. My daughter‚Äôs heart rate kept dropping so I was locked into place on my side and unable to move at all. After that, my labor began to stall so I was given pitocin (didn‚Äôt work) and then had my water broken (also didn‚Äôt speed up labor), until eventually I was rushed to the OR because my baby wasn‚Äôt tolerating labor. My daughter came out screaming and healthy and I‚Äôm extremely thankful for that, but it doesn‚Äôt make the experience better. It still gives me nightmares three years later. I remember feeling the pressure of them pulling my uterus out of my body and not being able to see my daughter when she started crying because of the drape between us. I remember the force of them shoving it back in and how it took the wind out of me while I was trying to look at my baby from across the room. I remember not being able to sit up to hold her on my chest without multiple people helping to prop me up. I remember a horrific and scary experience robbed of much of the joy that many women experience in childbirth and I don‚Äôt want to have another c-section unless it‚Äôs absolutely necessary for the health of myself and my baby. My official reason for the c-section was repeated fetal bradycardic episodes. It was also noted that my baby was ‚Äúpoorly engaged in the bony pelvis‚Äù (aka, she was sunny-side up and not dropping into my pelvis) and my pelvic inlet was ‚Äúborderline small‚Äù.  So this brings me to now. I have made it abundantly clear to my obstetrics team that I desire a trial of labor for this birth, but I still have a c-section scheduled for the day before my due date. They told me if I go into spontaneous labor before then, they will allow a trial of labor, but if not then I‚Äôll have to have the c-section and they need to have me ‚Äúon the books‚Äù. I‚Äôve been told that my small pelvis and stalled labor will make labor difficult and less likely to succeed and that‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt advise me to try for a vbac. However, the research I have been able to gather pertaining to my circumstances doesn‚Äôt necessarily back that up. I have no contradictions with this pregnancy and I had no problems with the first aside from the fetal distress which could have been caused by the poor positioning and her compressing the cord, which could have been exacerbated by them breaking my water before she had a chance to drop and me being unable to move around to facilitate any fetal movement. The ‚Äúsmall pelvis‚Äù diagnosis is highly subjective and problematic and I am leery to accept that something is wrong with my body and I‚Äôm unable to give birth for this reason. Even if my pelvis isn‚Äôt ideal for childbirth, this alone shouldn‚Äôt be an end-all be-all reason for a c-section if I don‚Äôt desire one. Small people birth big babies all the time and there isn‚Äôt good evidence to support the small pelvis diagnosis as reason for c-sections in most all cases.  I‚Äôm generally very trusting in my medical professionals and I feel somewhat uncomfortable challenging what my OB team recommends, but I feel like I‚Äôm being coerced and pressured into unnecessary major surgery. If I require a c-section for the health of my baby or myself, then I will consent to what needs to be done. However, at this point I don‚Äôt believe there is any reason to have a c-section scheduled. About 70% of women who attempt vbac succeed, which means the odds are on my side and I think I should be supported in my decision even if that means going past my due date for labor to spontaneously start. Why can‚Äôt I at least go closer to 41weeks? I understand the risks associated with vbac, I‚Äôm not going into this blindly. I want my chance.  I cannot stress how much I do not want a scheduled c-section. I‚Äôm having anxiety attacks regularly and crying daily thinking about it. I‚Äôm dreading these last few weeks of pregnancy‚Ä¶ they are filled with fear that I won‚Äôt go into labor soon enough. I‚Äôm tempted to start smoking again even though I quit almost 4 years ago because the anxiety because it‚Äôs so unbearable. I‚Äôm having nightmares about it. Idk how to be okay with this.  Thanks for listening. I‚Äôm sad.",

    "self_text": "I'm currently 20 weeks pregnant with my 2nd baby. On monday I have a amniocentesis coming up. Some background info on that: in Belgium, it is not performed anymore unless the baby is at high risk for viral infections that can cause major risks to the baby itself. And only if the risks are worth it.  For my situation:  When i was about 10 weeks pregnant i got a cold. I started loosing weight because of stress and nausea and my body, being sick, couldn't recoup so i got sicker and sicker and my mental health declined fast. So, At 10 weeks, the doc gave me 2 weeks of sick leave. When, by the time i reached 12 weeks, i had lost 2 kg, he gave me 3 more to see if my body could recouperate. However, at 14 weeks i was in his office again, crying my eyes out saying I couldn't handle it anymore mentally.  I felt burnt out (which had been coming since the first lockdown had me postpone my wedding only 1 week before it was supposed to happen). The thought of having to go back to work made me all kinds of sick because i was scared of not being able to do my work correct (i'm a teacher in high school)  At 15 weeks we got the results for the NIPT and other blood tests. Turned out that cold had been a CMV infection. Learning about all the risks that meant for my baby pushed me deeper into the hole. I was sent to a specialist and she told me that I had a 30% risk that CMV got to the baby. And IF it got to the baby, It had a 10% chance of getting a mild handicaps (like problems with hearing or motoric skills) and a 15% chance of getting a worse handicap (brain underdevelopped/undevelopped or worse).  However, the scans showed no early signs of that, thank god. It's been my light in the dark and kept me sane these last few weeks. I'm seeing a psychologist right now and on Monday I have to undergo a amniocentesis to check if the CMV actually got to the baby or not. And this is where my current stress comes in, because there are some things to consider:   An amniocentesis has a chance of causing a miscarriage, albeit a low chance. I have to be careful and rest for 2 days and go in on wednesday for a checkup.  If the CMV infection did reach the baby, i will have to be closely monitored. I will also get the question if we decide to terminate the pregnancy or not (which, right now, i do NOT want to consider or even think of).  If there is no cmv in the amniotic fluid (which we hope for) i still have to go to extra check ups, because you never know, no test is 100% safe. It will just be less frequent check ups.   Which means that i will still have a stressful pregnancy, even if the best option comes out of this. I try to stay positive of course, but I can't shake the underlying stress that keeps me tense. And I just needed to share this somewhere with people who might understand or could tell me their stories.  Ps. In the end I lost 4 kg in about 6 weeks time, rn it is stable, but i'm not gaining anything either. Gyn said that at least i'm not loosing any so thats ok given my level of stress.",

So gross but I just sat there in shock for like 5 minutes. I called the on call doctor and said I didn't think I was having contractions, they told me I could take my time getting to the hospital, wait for my husband to get home, etc. apparently I was wrong and the nurses and doctors couldn't believe my pain tolerance, turns out I was 5-6cm dilated! I honestly didn't feel much of anything at that point though, definitely nothing I would've thought were contractions. Started to get more intense after a few hours and I decided it was time for the epidural. I'm just chilling now, 8cm dilated, and he's moving right along and I'm very comfortable and excited!  Update: active Labor ended up being rough even with the epidural. I pushed for around 3 hours, for most of it, it was just exhausting but there was definitely serious pain towards the end and i was crying. But he's here now and I'm absolutely obsessed.

I already had a severe reaction the first time which required weeks off work and medication!What do I do?!   Back in late September I started getting these super itchy and painful bumps and blisters all over my body. Literally head to toe. After seven, yes you read that right, seven, trips to the doctor and a biopsy on my thigh to rule out pregnancy related rashes, I was diagnosed with a severe case of ringworm with the weirdest presentation my dermatologist has ever seen!  I had to take three weeks off of work and take an oral antifungal (super scary to do during pregnancy! They‚Äôre not recommended unless absolutely necessary!) for everything to heal and my cat was boarded for an entire month. We had just adopted him a month before and somehow the vets had missed a tiny spot of the fungus which proceeded to wreak havoc on my life.   Two weeks ago my cat got the all clear to come home and we were thrilled we were all healthy and could be reunited! He‚Äôs the sweetest, most loving animal I‚Äôve ever had and he makes our home feel complete!  And then yesterday we noticed a small cut on his lip. Of course we freak out and check it with a black light. Bright green, which means more than likely the ringworm is back. And it looks like I have my first ringworm blister to match. He‚Äôs going to the vet next week (the soonest we could get him scheduled) and I‚Äôm going to ask for oral medication for him to hopefully kick this for good!   But I am freaking out about going through this all over at 21 weeks pregnant! We‚Äôve done everything we can from sanitizing the whole house, boarding the cat, having all humans in The household take a course of oral antifungals, and we‚Äôve been total clean freaks. I don‚Äôt know how the cat got it again besides it potentially being a very stubborn strain.   Last time I got over 75 blistered and oozing (gross, sorry) sores all over my body and was so uncomfortable I could wear clothes or work. I also really don‚Äôt want to have to take oral antifungals again as they‚Äôre not typically recommended during pregnancy. I cant imagine having that happen again. I was a worried mess and the complete discomfort was so stressful and overwhelming on top of being pregnant for the first time after an ectopic pregnancy a few years ago. To say I‚Äôve been an emotional wreck is an understatement.   I love my cat, but at what point do we have to give up and focus on my health?

It was scary and painful (and he was only 3 lbs at birth).  I'm currently 33 weeks (the most pregnant I've ever been, yay), and the idea of going through full-term labour is low-key terrifying to me, especially if I miss the window for an epidural.  That being said, this baby is also currently in breech position, so we might have to schedule a c-section if he doesn't turn soon.  And while the c-section itself doesn't worry me as much (I'm a big believer in getting Mom and Baby through it as healthy and alive as possible), the recovery stories I've heard sound brutal.  Not only that, I have been scheduled to have my gallbladder removed maybe a month and a half after my due date.  I know this baby is coming out of me one way or the other, but I feel unequal to the task, I guess.  It's all so intimidating, and being on the older side (40), I worry that my body is going to struggle to heal from these traumas.

    "self_text": "First of all, I think most times, dogs can cohabitate safely with babies and kids. It requires training, vigilance, and management (to varying degrees, depending on the dog and the household) but I think for the majority of times, it works out fine.    ETA:  if you have concerns about your dog‚Äôs behavior around your kids, talk with your vet AND a qualified trainer before making big decisions. The r/dogtraining sub can help with that. Even if you don‚Äôt have concerns, it‚Äôs a good idea to do a class or two, just to learn because most problems can be prevented or managed with some basic training and structure and a good understanding of canine body language!   There are a few cases where a pet has to be rehomed prior to or after the arrival of a baby. I think as long as the owners have done their due diligence and tried their hardest, rehoming is very reasonable.  And then there are the rare cases that involve euthanasia.   I fall into the final category with my dog.   She has a long history of reactivity, dog aggression, stranger aggression, and a degree of owner aggression. She can be wonderfully sweet and I love her so much. She can also be very scary.   After 3.5 years of training, medications, management, good enrichment and exercise, she‚Äôs improved in some areas but not sufficiently in others to make her safe, particularly not around a child.   When my vet - who I trust - gently but honestly told me that our dog and baby would have to live completely separate lives, it rang true with a part of me that already knew that.   Anyway it‚Äôs not easy. I‚Äôve contacted many rescues who (understandably) will not take her. And so behavioral euthanasia is the safest option, even though it is a last resort.   Have grace for those pet owners who have tried their best. Of course some owners give up too quickly on their pets when kids are entering the picture, or they in general don‚Äôt prioritize their pets enough. But others have gone through all available options and have to make difficult, heartbreaking decisions.   I wish my dog could feel safe enough in the world to be safe in our soon to be growing family. I‚Äôll miss her forever.",

I guess this was more of a rant than anything but I‚Äôd love to hear from any mammas who can relate or have positive stories to share.   Thanks x",

    "self_text": "Hello, I am wondering if someone can explain to me following.   My friend was supposed to get her baby Monday, she went to her OBGYN and nothing happening yet to come back 2 days later‚Ä¶. She went on Wednesday again and her OBGYN could not get an ultrasound done because her fluid was gone but one two tiny spots (not enough to send her to the hospital) OBGYN said I think tonight or tomorrow it will happen, we won‚Äôt schedule an appointment for Friday, if Thursday no baby, call and you‚Äôll come in Friday.   1.) how did her fluid disappear without breaking ?   No we have Thursday night, nothing happening her contractions start some apart 4 minutes then nothing for two three hours then 10 minutes 6 minutes whatever..she tries to sleep, wakes up and tells me, she can‚Äôt the baby is so deep down it feels like it‚Äôs at the beginning of her V & it is on a Nerv that her left leg is in pain ‚Ä¶. I said well do you feel like you‚Äôve to push? She said NOT really ‚Ä¶. I said how about you try to look if you can see or feel something down there, she did and said nothing. I said okay. But was a little worried and said, I think you should go to the hospital.   I of course didn‚Äôt want to force or scare her with my thoughts, but I thought when the water is vanished (still confused how it could vanish without her noticing ?? Is that a thing)? 2.) That you should get 24h before possible infections etc can happen?   Anyways ‚Ä¶ today Friday (for her different time zone but Friday later in the day), she went to the OBGYN and her water is back ? 3.) what do they mean the water is back? I thought it vanished on Wednesday? And they notice when she gets a contraction baby‚Äôs heart goes down low ‚Ä¶ so she‚Äôs at the hospital (wait 6 hours later she was allowed to go there bc FULL) to check baby‚Äôs heart and the contraction   So my questions are 1)2)3)   If someone had experience like this or knows more than me? Id appreciate any input. Haha   Thank you so much :) obviously not telling her. Just bc I want to know what happens if I experience this in April lol",

Problem is I'm terrified of needles. Always have been. Just writing about this is making me cry right now. I had this incident 6 years ago, a blood test that went wrong, the lady barely touched a nerve in my arm, and I felt the worst pain I've ever felt in my entire life. Obviously the phobia got worst and I would feel this pain even at the view of a needle in a tv show or when people talk about it around me. Since then I've been working on my phobia, I managed to get tattooed, and even got my covid shots (fainted and puked and cry for the first two lol).  So, I'm going tomorrow morning. My SO is going with me, we both took the day off work. My obgyn is an angel and told me to only go when I feel it's the right time. I've been doing mental preparation for 2 weeks and everything felt ok, even today at work, but now I'm starting to panic and I don't think I'll be able to eat or sleep tonight.

    "self_text": "This is my first pregnancy, so I‚Äôm just trying to figure out if this is standard procedure...   I contacted my normal OB/GYN office at the end of September when I was about 5-6 weeks pregnant. The soonest they could get me in for my initial screening (phone call only) was today at 11 weeks. What a total waste of time that was. All the information they asked me for was already in my chart with them.   They scheduled me for my in person visit and their earliest available was 29Nov which would put me at just over 14 weeks! I made a comment about just looking forward to the ultrasound and they proceeded to tell me that this appointment was just to introduce me to the doctor and any ultrasounds would be referred out. Meaning I have no idea how far along I will be when I get my first medical ultrasound for this pregnancy.   I have no idea what to expect or what‚Äôs normal so it‚Äôs really bothering me that I‚Äôm not going to get an ultrasound or any reassurance until my second trimester. I haven‚Äôt told anyone we‚Äôre expecting because I have not been able to actually see a doctor and make sure everything is ok.   All that to say, experienced moms, is this normal? Should I be looking elsewhere for care? How can I make sure everything is ok in the meantime?  Thanks for reading!",

She‚Äôs smaller than what‚Äôs expected for 37 weeks so there‚Äôs some concerns. We got an appointment with the pediatrician tomorrow& a bunch of other appointments for her so I figured we‚Äôd both rest up. But that‚Äôs not the case. I gave both sides of the family a heads up that I‚Äôd be waiting 2 weeks till they can meet her. Especially now that she‚Äôs more likely to have health risks im more reassured on the 2 weeks. However now everyone is calling asking why they can‚Äôt meet her today as if this wasn‚Äôt explained before. My partner doesn‚Äôt really want to get involved so the calls have been redirected back to me. MIL feels like I‚Äôm taking her away from her grandkid but we literally live together. Any reassuring words for those who have been through this ?  Update: doctor said although she‚Äôs healthy even for her size, she recommends to wait 30 days because of all the illnesses going around. She said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what Zoom is for if they want to meet her that badly.‚Äù She was very kind& said that this is also time for me to heal because it‚Äôs been eventful& I don‚Äôt need added stress.

    "self_text": "To/dr: Having to wait until Thursday for ultrasound after huge bleed at weekend. Not sure if still pregnant and want you guys to tell me jokes to distract me.  Hope this is ok to post here. I‚Äôm about six week pregnant and I had been feeling lots of the expected symptoms like exhaustion, tender breasts and being a bit bloated. My husband and I were very excited and shocked as we‚Äôve been trying for 5 years and we‚Äôd never got pregnant. We‚Äôd sort of given up trying, so we got really excited about the news.  Then I started to spot and bleed a little which I had read was normal. Then my symptoms disappeared and the spotting and bleeding continued and got worse. Called the pregnancy team and they got us in straight away to test my blood last Wednesday. The next day they got us in for an ultrasound. We were panicking and assumed we were miscarrying. Cue ultrasound and there‚Äôs a heartbeat there and a 2mm embryo thingy. We were so relieved. They said they could see I had had a bleed, and that I had an ovarian cyst, and also said there was still another bleed there. They told me that I might get a bit more bleeding or that it might be absorbed. We went home so relieved.   The pain starting building that night so I went to bed. Friday was uncomfortable and painful but I put on a brave face and powered through. I woke up in agony on Saturday at 4.30am and went to the toilet and was bleeding like I‚Äôve never bled before. I had multiple huge clots falling out of me and just kept bleeding in agony for like 2 hours. I soaked through more than one pad. It was way more intense and traumatic than I had expected and so sore and I cried a lot thinking I‚Äôd miscarried. I called the out of hours line but no one answered.   Managed to call the pregnancy team in the morning and explained what happened. I‚Äôm booked in for another ultrasound but it isn‚Äôt until Thursday. On the phone they said they were concerned by my description about the amount of blood but did tell me that my hematoma was below the sack rather than above it which is a more positive thing. I‚Äôm shit scared, and there‚Äôs nothing that I can do apart from wait until Thursday. The pain is just sort of cramping period level pain now, same for the bleeding.  I feel so emotional and don‚Äôt know how to distract myself. The waiting is horrible. Cheer me up guys. Tell me silly jokes or anything.",

    "self_text": "Hi everyone, I guess I‚Äôm just looking to see if anyone has had any similar experiences.   In January 2021, I had an uncomplicated home birth. My daughter is now almost 22 months old and still breastfeeding. I stayed home with her for the first year but returned to work full time and she has done well adjusting to being away from me. I‚Äôm an RN so I work 3 12-hour shifts weekly. She mostly nurses for bedtime and naps, but on my off days she‚Äôll often nurse on demand for comfort if we‚Äôre at home.  My cycle never returned after having her. I thought it would around her first birthday, and then I thought maybe once I returned to work full time, but nope. I had really hoped to tandem breastfeed, but decided I‚Äôd wean her around her 2nd birthday if my cycle still wasn‚Äôt back as I‚Äôve been ready for baby #2 for a while. I‚Äôve tried taking ovulation strips the last 6 months but they never showed anything and I got frustrated as nothing was happening so I gave up. And I searched all over Reddit for people who had their cycle so delayed like mine and could only find a few rare instances.   Well, last Saturday I decided to take a pregnancy test as I‚Äôd felt uncharacteristically tired lately. SURPRISE. It‚Äôs a faint positive. I took 5 more on Sunday to make sure and they were all faint positives.   Monday I had an appt with my midwife as I had no idea how far along I was. She said I‚Äôm probably still early based on the faint positive and scheduled a dating ultrasound for 3 weeks out.  Tuesday I started spotting light pink and brown, and some cramping. My midwife said not to worry and that it could be normal. Wednesday there was some red blood but it faded to brown again. Thursday I woke up with a gush of red blood and put a pad on, which caught some blood throughout the day but not as much as a period. I took a home pregnancy test and it was extremely faint. Friday still bleeding, but still not very heavy. My midwife had me go get a blood test to check hcG levels, however the lab I went to was very disorganized and had me running to different locations and I think they ended up doing the wrong test, as it was supposed to be quantitative hcG but I got results this morning and they just say ‚Äúnegative‚Äù.   The bleeding stopped last night, but resumed a bit today.   Anyways, I‚Äôm pretty devastated but I‚Äôm assuming I was very early and it was a chemical pregnancy. I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone has had any similar experiences? How long should I expect to bleed for and will it get more painful or this it? It never got as painful as my periods used to be. And should I expect that my cycle will return next month?   TLDR- still breastfeeding 21 month old, cycle never returned, faint positive urine test, spotting which turned into bleeding, negative blood hcG test, looking for similar stories",

The process starts just before Christmas when I'm 38 weeks so I'll either be doing mine then or in the new year with a newborn on my hip.   I'm feeling very bitter about it all as even though I'm in a country where I will be protected as soon as I'm on maternity leave (meaning I can't be put on notice until I'm back), not interviewing at this incredibly difficult time would mean there won't be any jobs to apply for when I do get back. And as most of the jobs are pretty specific and in small teams (i.e. I would be the only person with that particular skillset on that team), I can't see any way I won't be discriminated against, not only because I'll likely not be able to perform to my usual standard, but because who in their right mind will want to hire me for such a specific role that won't be backfilled while I'm out for most of the year. Of course HR says there won't be any bias etc etc but I wouldn't trust a thing anyone in this company says without seeing a contract in my hands. They'll just go to extra lengths to document why I wasn't as suitable for the role as some other candidate.   Anyway I just wanted to rant and feel sorry for myself for a minute. I'll work something out, I'm just deeply resentful of the company putting me and the rest of my colleagues in this horrible situation just before Christmas. I don't think there's any advice anyone can offer but have at it if you have any nuggets of wisdom.",

I plan to breastfeed if I am capable, for all of the health benefits, bonding and savings, but the thought of being the only source of food and sustenance 24/7 for our baby is a daunting one. My husband would really like to take over -at least- one night feeding so he gets that special time with baby (even though it might not feel quite as special at 2 in the morning‚Ä¶) and I get more rest than I would otherwise. A bit of extra sleep and more importantly, a small sense of ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù (plus a baby ready to take a bottle whenever I‚Äôm finally ready to leave the house) sounds extremely enticing. Everything I‚Äôm reading so far says ‚Äúsure it‚Äôs possible, it‚Äôs really hard!‚Äù Or ‚Äúdoctors recommend waiting a few weeks before attempting to combo feed‚Äù so I was hoping someone had real life experience and advice for me.

By default they do two kinds of tests to screen for chromsomal disorders like Downs or the trisomies:   PAPP-A and HCG bloodwork  Nuchal Translucency   Looking into it though, they seem like really shitty tests.  Effectiveness of bloodwork/nuchal trans combined (see section titled \"Accuracy of the test\")  Effectiveness of nuchal translucency (see \"How accurate is this test?\")  TL;DR: Combined testing fails to catch 13-18% of cases, Nuchal translucency fails to catch 30-36% percent of the cases.  This seems totally fucked to me. My doctor says not to worry, that they tend to be conservative in their recommendations and refer people for further screening regularly. I'm 36 years old. Apparently people of my advanced age experience chromosomal anomalies in 1 out of every 289 pregnancies. So not super high risk, I guess, but still. The default screening seems essentially like witchcraft. I can't help but feel like he might as well just guess based on my aura.  I tried to talk him into signing me up for CVS or amniocentesis, but he wouldn't budge. Considering going into a walk-in or something just to get a second opinion. Personally, I find the risks associated with more invasive testing palatable, especially at my age. Not everyone feels that way, obviously, but my God, I feel like they should be telling people how effective the tests are.  Not sure how this will pan out. I guess I am hoping to see if there are other Canadians here who might be willing to shine a light on their experiences. From friends who have had babies, it seems like they weren't encouraged to do further testing based on the results of these two tests. I just can't believe that they deem this \"good enough\".",

    "self_text": "I had a heavy bleed 2 weeks ago that was filled with clots and heavy red blood. Went to emergency and got tests done and was told baby looked fine and healthy and it could have been possible implantation bleeding. Fast forward to this Thursday night - I had bleeding again but it wasn't as bad. I went back to emerge but this time was told they could not send out blood work or do any tests until the morning because their beds were full and the lab didn't open until the morning. I left and was told to follow up with my fertility clinic. I called Friday morning and was told I'd receive a call back but didn't until the end of the day. I was told to come in this Tuesday for a check up. The bright red bleeding stopped the night of but I had brown discharge that has now lasted 3 days and now looks more like coffee grounds... I have very light cramping in my lower back and uterus area..  Anyone experience this and the baby be okay? I am 12 weeks Monday and am just so concerned about this. I feel I'm not getting proper medical attention by anyone who I've tried to contact and continue to get overlooked. I live in Canada and our Healthcare system is not the best right now.",

    "self_text": "About 5 years ago, I found out I was pregnant. Now before I go any further.. I enjoy partaking in the devils lettuce..I did then and still do! Let's continue, when I found out at 5 weeks. I stopped smoking.  I went to my OB and of course they ask all the normal questions, \"do you drink, smoke, drugs, meds..etc\" Well I answered honestly \"smoke (mj) occasionally but stopped once I found out.\" He was very understanding and that was that. Fast forward to my due date... Christmas üéÑ  and 2 days after I've given birth, CPS shows up to my room while I have guests.. (parents and inlaws).  CPS: Hello, Mrs B we are CPS, we've come to talk to you about an open investigation we have.  ME:  on meds  and breastfeeding my NB with my hubs help.  Ohh um okay, what's this about.  NURSE: Hey guys can we give them a moment to talk please. Parents and inlaws leave the room.  CPS: We got a call, to come talk to you.  Now we aren't here to take your baby, that's not what we do. But I would like to get some more info from you if that's okay.  HUBBY: Whats this about?  Well here's a summary:  My OB called CPS after he delivered my NB.. also found out thru my patient portal that I was getting randomly drug tested through out my pregnancy to make sure I wasn't continuing \"abusing\" drugs.  They came for me to do a drug test to make sure. and to test my NBs urine as well.  We were both clean and clear. She told me they would follow up in 2 weeks, for another drug test...AT MY HOUSE! They never did show up for the follow up. But I'm been scarred since.  I'm not taking any blame away from myself, I chose to smoke.. I made those choices  And I know my doctor was just doing his job.. but I to see that I was drug tested, to see on the hospital bill that my NB was drug tested too... is scary.  Sorry I know this is long. But we are almost finished.  Cut to pediatric visit. Dr is amazing, no judgement, said my baby is thriving so well, she's healthy and growing perfectly.  But first thing she said was.. \"I see you smoked mj, can I ask why?\" Like i said no judgment at all!  We had to find a new Pediatrician, and the moment this women met me, I got 3 papers to fill out about drug use and they were very uncomfortable questions.. Here's a few for context: \"Have you felt you needed to rely on alcohol or drugs to get thru the day?\" \"Do you find yourself thinking you can't adjust to life without drugs or alcohol?\" \"Do you think of harming yourself or your baby because you're tired of life\"  WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS ARE THESE?!  Icing on the cake, she saw my LTC I.D and then proceeded to lecture me about the guns in my own home, and what do I really need it for?  I'm happy to answer any questions and I'll be completely transparent! Sorry it was so long but I needed to get this out!",

I won't be telling my family for quite some time as I have a strained relationship with them, but if the pregnancy continues in a healthy way, I hope to announce it to my in laws at Christmas!

    "self_text": "Alright. Here it goes.Since reach 3rd trimester I kept crying \"get this baby out!\"   Possible TW? Verbiage.   Well, last night I went to bed and woke up around midnight.  I thought I had to poop and when I went to sit on the toilet I felt pressure and thought to myself. Maybe I'm actually experiencing Braxton hicks. To play on the safe side though I downloaded a contraction time and timed my contractions. I had finished a childbirth class the week before so I knew about the \"511\" rule.  Obviously though, life absolutely hates me because instead of 1 min contractions every 5min I had them every 2. I wish I could type that in all caps. So I called the on call nurse of my OB who said typically they want you to wait for 2hrs but because of my frequency I should just go to the hospital now. Luckily, the hospital was only 15min away.  I KNEW I wanted an epidural, prior to that though i was in so much pain they gave me IV medication to take off the edge until I could get one. When it was finally time, I experienced WAY to much pain from the epidural I had to tell the anesthesiologist to just stop, because I rather the every 2min contractions over THAT pain.   Because of not having an epidural I felt as though I was dying. They decided to pump me up more of sedatives to help me while also telling me when it was time to push.   Now imagine being drugged and told to push. Not to mention how exhaustive I was just from dealing with the pain. I have no clue how long I was pushing. When the nurses changed over I got a group that kept pushing for me to try again for an epidural. (At this point the baby was getting distressed) they were telling me either I need an epidural or I was going to have to have a c section while under general anesthesia. I ended telling them \"respectfully to stop trying to push the epidural\" honestly I think I developed some ptsd from that experience alone. I told them I rather the c section.   So they decided they were going to try to help me push instead and when my doctor finally made it and they told them the situation and what they recommended he told them I had good pushes and to keep going. After what felt like a lifetime we found a good way for me to push and, after dealing what felt like excruciating pain between contractions and some medical intervention on my OB's part, at 10am 11/14  I gave birth to a baby girl.  Unfortunately I have not been able to hold or see her because she was having breathing problems but I've been hearing she's doing better. And she can breathe on her own.  My whole medical team were absolute angels and even though I was unsure of them at first they really proved to be angels in disguise.   My husband, I couldn't have done it without it. From the moment I realized and woke him up, to him staying by my side and helping me push. Trying to do as much as he could to help me. Once our daughter was born he had such a proud dad moment on his face and went to her asking questions on what was going on.",

    "title": "Most used items and advice from the other side at 4 weeks postpartum",
    "self_text": "I used to enjoy seeing what items people found genuinely useful so here are my two cents!   Burp cloths and wash cloths. My baby spits up like no other and I am constantly cleaning it up on myself, on her and on everything in our house.  I think it goes without saying, but diapers and wipes. She also poops like no other.  Mattress protector. Due to #1 I have a minimum of one puke in my bed a day. I breastfeed and we sometimes do the side laying position so maybe you won‚Äôt have this problem in your situation, but I wash our sheets multiple times a week and I can‚Äôt imagine what my mattress would look like if we didn‚Äôt have a protector on it. I can link mine if anyone is interested because a lot of them have mixed reviews.  If you‚Äôre breastfeeding, snacks and drinks. People said that time and time again but when you‚Äôre breastfeeding you are unreasonably hungry and you really do need a constant supply of quick and easy snacks.  Also if you‚Äôre breastfeeding, a list of shows and books. Breastfeeding is a full time job so get comfy and buckle up.  Sleep gowns. My girl was born long and never fit into her newborn sleepers, so we have spent a ton of time in the gowns since they are long enough to cover her feet. They also make diaper changes easy because you just pull it up and down.  Frida Mom peri bottle. It is so much better than the one the hospital gave me because of the angled squirter.  I have a wand on my shower and it was a lifesaver. Between horrible hemorrhoids and tearing pretty badly, I usually would just use the bathroom and hop right in the shower and rinse myself waist down. Bonus is that the hot water just feels amazing every once in a while when you feel like you need a few minutes to yourself.   Some advice I have in general!    Shower every day!!!!! I have seen on other pages some women don‚Äôt have time to shower everyday and some say they only have time a couple times a week. I think this is the single most important way for you to stay sane postpartum and it is so worth it to take 10 minutes to yourself to feel like a real person. I am covered in puke and poop all day and not to mention my postpartum night sweats were BAD the first two weeks and I can‚Äôt imagine going more than a day or two without a shower. Please take care of yourself. It is okay to let the baby cry for 10 minutes if that‚Äôs the only way you can manage a shower.  If breastfeeding, do some research and join the breastfeeding subreddit. I was expecting it to be difficult but it is actually sooo much more work than I imagined, however so rewarding. You will question if your baby is getting enough constantly but do your research and know that the body really is damn near perfect and understand what is going on. Cluster feeding is a bitch and you‚Äôll spend hours upon hours in one spot some days and that‚Äôs just all part of the process. Also get some nursing clothes and a good robe, because your boobs are out like, all day lol.  Don‚Äôt compare your baby, body or situation to anyone else‚Äôs. My baby cries constantly (colic, gas, traumatic birth, we‚Äôre not sure what the deal is but she is just a fussy screamer) and I see all these other women posting online their babies all happy and I have gotten myself pretty down at times. But I have no idea what their situation is like behind closed doors and there is just no sense in comparing our situations.   Time moves so quickly and the days just fly by taking care of a newborn. They say everything is a phase when they‚Äôre this little and I‚Äôm still waiting on mine to grow out of her extra fussy phase, but I do see how everything is so short lived in the grand scheme of things. So soak in all your newborn snuggles that you can get because they are always growing and changing, even at only 4 weeks.   Sorry it‚Äôs so long. I hope it is helpful in some way!",

So seeing our little one and their little arm and leg buds forming was a big deal to us.   We‚Äôre planning on formally announcing after we take family pictures with just the two of us in December once we‚Äôre around 11-12 weeks. This morning after seeing the ultrasound and my doctor telling us everything looked great, we decided we would tell our parents this week and next week - mine at thanksgiving and his when his parents are in town next week - and ask not to say anything until we are comfortable publicly announcing because of the previous MC.   A few hours later he said we needed to wait because my MIL would be upset with us and hold it over our heads and have an attitude if she found out last or so long after my parents. I think this is absolutely ridiculous but it‚Äôs not a battle I really want to fight for the rest of my life so we‚Äôre waiting to tell everyone until next week when we can tell them all on the same day. I‚Äôm not really looking forward to telling MIL honestly - she‚Äôs extremely over the top and can be overbearing (has already said she‚Äôs going to have a full nursery in her house before we ever even talked about trying for a kid).

If you needed a reminder to take your birth control, here it is. \" Copy and Pasted word for word. No this is not a \"birth control reminder\" this is actually amazing that your kid sees you put on makeup and is able to to connect it to putting makeup on the face of said Squishmallow. The kid is smart! To be able to mimic your actions?! But parents say this about everything: I left my coffee cup out in range of my toddler and he spilt it, birth control reminder. I left my 2 year old UNATTENDED IN THEIR ROOM FOR 30 MINUTES and they painted their bed with paint, birth control reminder. Both of these are very real posts I have seen. Stop shaming your kids for being kids. Stop acting like your kids existence and the way they are learning to be HUMANS is so horrible. Yes it sucks having to clean up those messes and yea you might of had to throw away a few things but that is what it is to have a growing human. As an expecting parent, it hurts seeing parents say this about a little being they created and are expecting to teach the way of the world to.

I am currently pregnant and was excited to encapsulate my placenta after hearing of all of its benefits to new moms BUT my midwife sent me a message saying her and her practice strongly urge against it. I did a little bit more research and found that it can actually slow breast milk production and cause a few other issues. There are not enough studies to support it's health benefits.  I wanted to reach out here and see if anyone has a personal experience with this to share, either positive or negative to help me better decide on what to do. Maybe you took another route with consuming the placenta after? I respect my midwife and take her advice very seriously, so I am considering skipping this. I'm only 22 weeks and have time to get more information! Thank you!",

We had to be kept in the hospital for a few days and daily follow up visits for the 2 weeks after discharge and family have been the most irritating people. I swear I‚Äôm at the end of my tether with them.   The day we were due to come home MIL wanted to come up with her friend (Yes, her friend!). My partner told her no, so she decided to ring me 3 times before he got to the hospital to see if she could convince me to give her a yes. She didn‚Äôt get a yes from me.   The following day my FIL and his wife rocked up (uninvited) at 10am and we had to be in the hospital for 1pm, his wife was smothering with a cold and started touching  my baby‚Äôs face with her used tissue crumpled up in her palm that she just blew her nose in! I got pissed, and asked her to not touch the baby since she‚Äôs sick and my FIL snapped back saying ‚ÄòShe‚Äôs gonna get colds and flu‚Äôs you can‚Äôt keep her in a bubble‚Äô For one it might not be a cold, it could be Covid, RSA or something more serious! And two she is 3 days old, she doesn‚Äôt need any illness!   My MIL got extremely pissed that FIL seen the baby first (Intense divorce years ago that results in a weird competitiveness) she decided to just show up with her friend. She wanted photos and I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with this (3 days in hospital, not showered, not feeling up for a photo shoot really) but no, I was being a prude ‚ÄòNo-one cares what you look like, they‚Äôre memories‚Äô   My mother came up (with permission) and wasn‚Äôt too bad but did take the baby off me which really hurt! I was struggling to settle the baby after a feed and my mother just grabbed her with a sigh as if to say ‚ÄòGive her here, you‚Äôre clueless‚Äô she didn‚Äôt say this but this is how it came across.   Brother in law wanted to come up but was 4 hours late and rocked in at 10pm.   Sister in law was pissed we didn‚Äôt open her gifts immediately and her 2 year old slapped the baby in the face (He‚Äôs only 2 I get that but it was just another irritating thing)   Moral of this, people suck and just want to be able to claim they seen the baby first. Decide what your wishes are, make sure you‚Äôre both on the same page and stick to it! Next time I‚Äôm waiting a month and they can all visit at the same time for an hour maximum!",

Woke at five am with horrid chest pain. Went to my visit and my blood pressure was 150/88. They asked if I experienced blurry vision. I said no. Then realized I wasn‚Äôt wearing my glasses due to them hurting my eyes. They sent me over to John Hopkins to be exalted immediately.  I was a panicked mess just asking if I could go home my apt was at nine. By noon at triage they had decided. I was to be induced immediately. They got me in a room at two but I asked to eat before starting as I hadn‚Äôt eaten since dinner the previous night. At three they informed me it could be hours before I was induced I begged to go home and come back.  See my fil wanted us to get home to kids right after my doctors apt to go buy a new lawn mower. Of course being induced he knew we couldn‚Äôt but in my hormonal shocked mind I had to get home. I almost signed out ama because I was terrified. There were people screaming in the hallway ( 7 people came in after me ten centimenters crowning with natural births and frankly there screams made me wanna leave).  At 4:45 they started inducing I was four cm and 0 effaced and station -3. By 6 I had a epidural and was 5 cm and 0% effaced. An hour later they broke my water because she was low. Didn‚Äôt get to 6 cm until around 10 pm. And wasn‚Äôt seven centimeters until 2:30 am. At 3:30 am they contractions were horrrid my epidural had stopped working. I felt the need to push (despite the same place almost missing catching my previous daughter they didn‚Äôt believe I was ready and feuded to check me for an hour). Each contraction I had to fight the urge to push and felt everything. Finally when they check at 4:45 am I was crowning.   My doctor came in and started having me practice push a bit for a few minutes. At 5:10 I was ready to really start pushing but was so tired from bo sleep I only pushed every third or fourth contraction. At 5:29 am my third girl Mayari Lynn was born. 7 lb 5 oz 19 long. Right away a perfect latch ( my other two never latched) only now day two is she even crying and that is minimal. Fierce appetite. Poops like a champ and is over all a amazing baby. My others came out crying and never stopped.   It was tough. With the fact it was record high for birth in my hospital they say she was born it was hard getting staff. But we were sent home 11/24 at 11:30 to spend thanksgiving with my other two girls and it was great. Sadly my 2 yr old is trying help in the worse ways. And my 8 yr old has a horrid cold so I can‚Äôt let her bear the baby just yet. But over all terrifying birth, hard pregnancy, but amazing little girl.",

Today my husband was sent home from work (from the family business where his mother and cousin both work) because his cousin tested positive for C-19 on at home test. He took the test because another coworker‚Äôs wife tested positive in the hospital, the cousin was not showing symptoms and feels fine. The cousin‚Äôs wife is also pregnant with a two and a half year old in daycare so I believe he is working to get in to the doctor today for an official test.   I am freaking out a bit. Both my husband and I are fine as of now, not showing symptoms, and have normal temperatures. Because I have already reached my due date I feel as if I can‚Äôt put off my induction but am also a bit panicky because of contagion issues and labor/delivery or having a newborn with the potential of one or both of us getting C-19.

Anyone that can provide reassurance or suggestions of additional quarantine would be helpful! I know MIL will want to come over as soon as she is able/allowed but where she has been helping with the hand, foot, and mouth, I am freaking out. My mom does not live in the area and will likely come down after the 3 day period. This could become a time of jealously unfortunately, but I don‚Äôt want to risk my baby.

I took the screen the same time as my NIPT, got my results about 2 weeks later. Got an email from the genetics counselor same day or immediate day after. Scheduled an appointment via video (about a week-10 days after result), she explained how if husband is also a carrier, there's a 75% they won't have SMA but 25% chance they will and we can do CVS/amnio if he tests as a carrier to find out if baby has it.   He took his blood test next day, got results back about 8 days later though they said it would be 2-3wks.   Try not to Google too much like I did and wait to get your partner's result, and the CVS/amnio result, before getting too freaked out. Ask the genetics counselor, not Google lol.   I live in SF, CA and have Kaiser Northern California. Hope this helps someone out there.  *Edit: whoops sorry, seems like SMA screen is separate from NIPT. I took all my screens including the NIPT at the same time and lumped a bunch under \"NIPT\". If you only took the NIPT, you may not have been screened for SMA.",

That's when I lost it. I called my doctor and they said come in in a week my dates could be off. I'm confident on my dates.  I was tracking my period and ovulation for a year. I couldn't be more confident in my dates but still the OBGYN is telling me to wait. I was hoping they would bring me in for a transvaginal ultrasound but no.   Has anyone had an abdominal ultrasound at 8 weeks with no heartbeat? It seems like the majority of early ultrasounds are transvaginal.

    "self_text": "I‚Äôm 37 + 3 and so confused about when to deliver. I understand that it‚Äôs more favorable for labor to happen on its own unless medically necessary (my only risk with this pregnancy is that I just turned 35 ‚Äî otherwise I‚Äôm completely healthy). Baby  does  have a slightly dilated kidney, but the condition isn‚Äôt severe enough to warrant early delivery, according to a urologist we saw ‚Äî he‚Äôll follow up with tests once she‚Äôs here.   When we had Baby‚Äôs level 2 ultrasound (at an outside facility ‚Äî not my OB‚Äôs office but a place where we were referred), the doctor there said he recommended delivery at 39 weeks, just because, in his opinion, there‚Äôs no benefit for mothers aged 35+ to waiting longer. When my OB saw the note, she asked if I was comfortable with this assessment and I said no, that I‚Äôd like to wait until at least my due date to be induced (Dec 9, 40 weeks).  Now, though, my OB is out of the office and at each weekly appointment the substitute OBs ask about the ‚Äúrecommend delivery at 39 weeks‚Äù note in my chart and I‚Äôm having to repeatedly say I don‚Äôt want to be induced that early. But ironically the more assertive I am the more I question if I‚Äôm truly making the best decision for myself ‚Äî maybe getting induced on my due date is still too early. I‚Äôm reading about the risks of pitocin, and though they‚Äôre minimal, I‚Äôm scared.  But what if that one doctor was right, and delivering at 39 weeks is the way to go? I‚Äôve seen so many Stillbirth-at-39-Weeks horror stories, and though I know that‚Äôs unlikely, maybe it‚Äôs best to get her out right away.   So yeah, I‚Äôm confused and  not  asking for anyone to make this decision for me. Just wondering if there are any factors here that would influence you in making a similar decision, how you arrived at making your own decision about when to deliver, or what you‚Äôre thinking about as you decide.

I want to give a special thank you to the posters who pointed out that I'm likely understating the extent of the illness - it is quite debilitating, and I am really only functional a couple days of the week at most. I also want to thank folks who pointed out that the mental suffering - loneliness, depression, anxiety - is legitimate, and reason enough to want support. Big thank you to you all, and everyone who reminded me to be compassionate to myself in this really tough time.  We're still talking it through, but I am more confident in what I want and need. Thank you all!  ---  I'm in my first trimester and having pretty bad morning sickness at leasat 3 or 4 days a week. Before I got pregnant, my partner booked a backpacking trip w friends for two weeks in December. He's been an incredible source of support and care, and truly I don't know how I'd get through without him.  For context on my morning sickness: I'm ok some days, but there are days I can't get up or can't keep anything at all down. I've had to take classes from home, and ask my ob for extra medication re nausea and vomiting. I'm worried about days like that, because I am pretty impaired.  I'm worried about that two week period - I don't love the idea of being alone on the holidays to begin with (I'd originally planned to go somewhere separately), and I know I will be miserable taking care of myself. I don't have my family nearby, and I don't love the idea of asking friends to take shifts to take care of me. My in laws offered to take me in for a few days, but I don't really want to do that either.  He is worried about me, and says he'll cancel if I want him to or if we don't have a good backup plan in pace.  Any advice on how to think this through?",

My OB says it's up to me whether we try for vaginal (and do a c-section if it doesn't work) or just schedule a c-section.   This is my first, so I don't know how to choose? I would prefer a vaginal, largely because I'm 36 and we'll likely be trying for a second kid reasonably soon.   Even if we do a c-section, I'll still have the fibroid and TBD on whether I'd need separate surgery (too big a risk to remove with baby) to remove it prior to a second child.   I'm also thinking about going through the physical exertion of a vaginally birth, then doing a c-section .. it seems like the worst of both worlds.   I feel so unprepared to decide!

I‚Äôm 12 weeks and super nervous about vomiting during takeoff or landing and not being able to run to the bathroom. Medication has not been helpful so that‚Äôs out. I‚Äôm thinking of requesting to have my seat changed to an aisle seat near a bathroom...any other ideas?  Edited to add: The advice was so helpful thanks so much everyone! I didn‚Äôt throw up once on the four flights I had! For anyone reading in the future, this is what I did and found helpful. I did my best to get an aisle seat near the back when I checked in‚Äîone time I had a middle seat and felt so sick smelling people‚Äôs breath. Window seat would have been just as bad, I think I would have felt claustrophobic. Wearing a double mask with vicks on really helped, as did the nice smelling lotion. I sniffed alcohol wipes sporadically when the nausea got bad. I took gravol before boarding and ate something nutritious and safe beforehand, and then had lots of snacks and a cold drink for during the flight. I also wore anti nausea bands, although I‚Äôm not sure they helped so much, but they made me feel prepared. I also bought emesis bags and gallon ziplocks to put the used ones in, and even though I didn‚Äôt use them they made me feel less panicky when there were some moments where I thought I might get sick. Flight attendants gave me ginger ale as the flight began and they would check up on me halfway through. Being near the bathroom was really helpful when I needed a breath of ‚Äúfresh‚Äù air since the smell of people really triggers me. I felt prepared as I possibly could which really helped me relax",

I have an 11 month old boy and an 11 year old step daughter and am 33wks along (maybe 35wks, baby was huge at ultrasound so idk) with our next boy.   My stepdaughter's birthday was in September. She turned 11 and I swear to God this child thinks she is  17 all of a sudden. I cannot handle it and honestly it isn't all her fault. Like I am aware that I have an astronomically short fuse right now. I was like this with my first pregnancy. By the third trimester, I really was just annoyed with her pretty much constantly. However, last time she wasn't pushing buttons and I knew I was the one in the wrong.   This time around it feels like she is just purposefully pushing buttons to get me to flip out. I swing back and forth from feeling like a shitty mom to knowing that the behavior she is presenting isn't acceptable even if I wasn't pregnant. Like she'd still be in trouble, but probably less trouble or things wouldn't be as big of a deal. Idk she is usinging up all of my patience and it's to the point where I snapped at my 11 month old.  I was mad at her and he came over to me whining because he wanted held and I snapped at him to stop it because he wouldn't stop grabbing my pants. He looked so hurt. He did the little lip quiver and then started actually crying. I picked him up and he was fine but like I would not have normally snapped at him.   I called my mother in law and she is taking step daughter tomorrow because I honestly just don't want her here right now, which I k iw is super shitty and I feel horrible about. I can't wait till my hormones chill out and I get back to my normal patience levels. I feel so mean to everyone right now and idk how to fix it.",

    "title": "Unexpected nice lil break from celiac",
    "self_text": "This is not medical advice whatsoever. Just a personal anecdote.   Prior to pregnancy I heard things that really freaked me out that made me worried about getting glutened, like increasing risk of miscarriage. After fainting due to anemia in 2017, and iron supplements not taking effect, my doctor suggested I quit gluten for 3 weeks and see what happens. By the end of the 3 weeks, the anemia was gone (iron levels restored) and all medications I was on (antidepressants, ADHD meds) felt way too strong (I was on a very high dose for each for my size) and I ended up going down to about 1/4 what I was on, and quitting them completely a few years after. Only about a week after quitting gluten, the brain fog parted, chronic fatigue subsided, it was awesome.   But over the years, I'd get glutened here and there. Even trace things like soy sauce, food touching non-gf food/cross-contamination, etc., I'd get huge inflamed rashes/hives on my elbows and more recently in other places usually hours after consuming. I'd usually have blood in my stool for several days and lots of discomfort in my stomach and colon. Parts of my food would often come out undigested out the other end for about 3 weeks (I could tell what I'd eaten), and the fatigue, irritability, brain fog, etc would be there. It made me really paranoid about what if I got glutened during pregnancy.   Well ...... after getting pregnant, when I was nauseous, I accidentally ate a cracker I thought was gluten free that turned out to be just \"organic\" and weirdly close to the gf stuff section of the grocery store aisle. I was terrified thinking oh no, that's it, now I'm going to miscarry .... and nothing happened. No rash, no stomach issues, a teeny bit of blood my first poo but that was it. Very mild.  During that frantic google search, I kept hearing anecdotes from other celiacs and gluten intolerants on reddit and other places that they were able to eat gluten again during pregnancy up to about 2 months postpartum. Stuff about autoimmune reactions being suppressed during pregnancy. After doing some reading over the next few weeks, I felt reassured and tested the waters by starting with trying little bits of food that have some soy sauce. No reaction again.   Three days ago I decided to try half a slice of sourdough (lower gluten) bread. No reaction!! Then I got a freaking sourdough bread bowl. No reaction again! Then a slice of cheesecake with graham cracker crust (non-sourdough). OMG. I hadn't had real bread or non-gluten-free things on purpose in 5 years!  I just wanted to put this out there in case anybody else has been worried about getting glutened during pregnancy. Not all bodies react the same way and not all will have this particular autoimmune suppression situation, and it is probably safest to keep avoiding gluten if you are unsure. But if you do accidentally end up getting glutened, maybe you'll be okay, like me and some other preggos have been. Maybe you'll even get to eat a ton of that glorious delicious bread that has been forbidden for a while without symptoms too. Bodies are amazing!! Definitely a pregnancy perk I did not see coming whatsoever.",

My OB says we will only be doing Pitocin to get things moving, but I am absolutely terrified of using synthetic medicine, I normally have very strong reactions to anything chemical and was planning on a completely unmedicated birth so this new plan is definitely making me work on releasing control and testing my anxiety-managing skills :|  I would love to hear some success stories (if there are any) of being induced and still having a low-intervention vaginal birth.   I was looking forward to being able to stay at home for the first part of labor because I absolutely hate (am scared of) hospitals and this new plan just has me dreading every minute of my birthing process, which makes me so sad.

    "title": "My Graduation Story: Nothing went as planned",
    "self_text": "My entire pregnancy was pretty easy and straightforward and I‚Äôm very grateful for that because not everyone is so lucky. I went in for my bi-weekly NST on Tuesday, November 22nd, and my baby was ‚Äúnon-reactive‚Äù. I also had my weekly US and OB visit scheduled for that day but appts were bumped up to see what was going on. My US revealed that amniotic fluid was low. Per my OB, it was at a 4 and needed to be 5 or higher. Luckily, this was found on that day because due to the holiday, the office would be closed the following Friday, which was the second day I went for weekly testing. OB sent me to labor and delivery to be induced. I stopped at home to grab my and my husband‚Äôs bags  and a few snacks to eat pre-induction. I was super excited and feeling positive about the entire experience. I arrived at the hospital around 2:30pm, was checked into my room about an hour later and was super chill. My mom arrived around 5pm and my husband around 6pm, because I told him to wait until he got off work before heading over. My induction began at 5:30pm. At the time, I was only 1cm dilated. The foley balloon was inserted after much digging lol (I have a tilted cervix). Not painful. Then, I was started on 2 milliunits/min Pitocin with the understanding that it would be gradually increased until early the next morning when everyone expected me to be fully dilated and ready to give birth. By 11:30pm, I decided to get the epidural because contractions started coming in, were a little unpleasant, and I wanted to sleep to have energy to give birth. Well, the Pitocin didn‚Äôt work. By the next day, I had only dilated to 3cm because of the balloon and my body was not responding to the ever increasing Pitocin. My contractions were coming every 2 minutes but weren‚Äôt strong enough, so the Pitocin was increased. I didn‚Äôt feel any of it. Thankfully, I decided to get the epidural the night before because I probably would have been in agony without it. At 6:30am Wed morning, my was broken and the OB said it can take up to 24 hours to get to where I need to be. Welp, 4:30am on Nov 24, Thanksgiving Day, my contractions were still regular, Pitocin was at 30 milliunits/min, and I had only been 5.5 cm dilated. It was then that I was told I‚Äôd have to go in for a c-section. The procedure lasted for about 45 minutes from start to finish and was pretty smooth, or so I thought. I was informed that because I had been on Pitocin for so long, I had hemorrhaged and blood clots had formed in my uterus. It was a mess but I survived, am doing fine, considering the super rough recovery, and my baby girl is here and is healthy.",

    "self_text": "(I posted this in r/babybumps as well but wouldn't let me share the post across so I have pasted it!)  Hey all. Currently growing baby #2 and we've just had our \"12 week\" scan.  Nothing was mentioned at our scan and everything with baby seemed to be perfect (to me, anyway) but with the NT measurement taken and my bloods, the screening test results came back as \"increased chance\" of baby having down syndrome.   We were advised it's a 1 in 42 chance, which I've been advised is 2 point something % chance.   Wasn't overly keen on having an amnio or CVS, so I opted for NIPT - which I had done yesterday and just waiting on the results. (Could take a week/just overüòî)  I've read a few posts on here regarding this and I'm also aware of r/NIPT... but I don't know if it's helping me or making me feel worse. I take everything with a pinch of salt anyway as I know everyone's circumstances are different.   They never told me if it was because of the NT measurement or if anything was amiss on the scan, they also never said it was down to my blood results, they just mentioned it was a combination of both, and including my age when baby is born (which would be 31)  My gut is telling me everything will be fine, trying to ride on that 97(ish)% chance that baby doesn't have down syndrome, and it's not about that so much, I just worry that there may be other defects.  I think I just feel a bit scared, and in limbo whilst we are waiting for the results.  Thanks all for reading.",

No emergency, but a ‚Äúbetter safe than sorry‚Äù situation.   So I call everyone. My bf comes home from work, we get our daughter early from school. I contact all the family who would care and let them know. Change up all of their plans so they can be available to watch my daughter, hand her over to the next person who will watch her, etc.  Go to the hospital and wait for hours. They told me it wouldn‚Äôt be til tomorrow (now today) that I‚Äôll be induced so I asked to go home. They told me I could, and to call back  at 8am to make sure they have space but to plan on coming in at 9 this morning.  So again I have to make new plans with all the family. Who will pick up my daughter from school isn‚Äôt the one who can babysit, so they have to drive my daughter to one family members, then another will pick her up a little later, then drop her off at the family that will be able to watch her overnight.   Only to be told the hospital is full and to call back later to see if I can be induced then.   This is nobody‚Äôs fault and I‚Äôm not mad. I‚Äôm just frustrated at how hectic this has become. I was supposed to meet up with my boss yesterday to fill out papers for maternity leave and I can‚Äôt do that because I keep thinking I‚Äôm about to leave to be induced.   I guess I am just worried that I am going to keep hearing that the hospital is too full. My bf could be working, his paternity leave doesn‚Äôt start yet. I don‚Äôt have babysitters for tomorrow, but will again on Friday. But soon people are going to stop wanting to plan their day around my inductions that keeps getting pushed back.   Again, not trying to complain. The hospital can‚Äôt know how many actual emergencies or women in natural labor will walk through their doors. I know my family/babysitters will have to suck it up and roll with the punches but it‚Äôs still stressful.  Anyways, just needed to vent.",

Needless to say, I don't want him here until a couple of months after the birth because I know he will make it about himself, he will kiss the baby when I tell him not to, he won't respect my wishes as a parent, he will piss me off, and I will lose my mind.¬† Well, today my mom broke the news to him (I have been begging her to do this for months) that SHE ALONE will be coming for the birth, without him.¬† The purpose of her being here during the birth is to support, help with laundry, help me bathe and do all of the other embarrassing things to recover, cook food, etc for my husband and I.¬† She even explained that she is coming here to help out, not for a social visit, and of course now he is the victim.¬† He says he \"just assumed\" he was going to come out too, he says he is so hurt, and doesn't understand.¬† My mom even reminded him that her own mother came out for the birth of both of their kids, and that dad did not come. I am only asking him to wait a month or two until I'm ready.¬† Until I'm not wearing diapers, and at a time when I can actually interact with him rather than worry about putting pants on every time he's around.¬† I also don't trust him not to ignore my wishes regarding the baby, and I won't be able to stop him if I'm busy recovering.¬† Even my MIL is like \"just let me know when you are ready to see me and I will be there right away, no rush!\"¬†¬†  My mom is in a shit position.¬† She wants to be here so bad, and this may be yet another thing that she misses in my life because she doesn't want to upset him for not being included.¬† She is the one who still chooses to live with him, I get that, but she is a victim just the same.  I'm in a shit position.¬† I'm worried that he will just come out here anyway (which will cause a HUGE issue because my husband backs me on this 100%).¬† I feel like such an asshole for putting up this boundary, but I know for a fact that it will be extremely negative for my relationship with my dad if he comes out here and pisses me off like he usually does.¬† I just don't want to deal with his nonsense on top of being a FTM.¬† He doesn't have any idea how obnoxious he is to deal with, and I am trying to break this to him without telling it to him like that.¬†¬†I even thought if he's going to insist on coming, maybe I would just not tell them when baby comes. But then I miss out on having my mom here, and obviously that would be extremely upsetting for me to keep from her.   I just don't want to ruin this experience for myself, I don't want to cause issues between him and my mom, and I don't know how to navigate this.",

I understand that GB can develop through out the weeks but ‚Ä¶ the following was making me very upset.  I came there and the doctor just slammed me for eating to much sugar, drinking to many soda‚Äôs, having no exercise and on top of it all : she had opinions about me for being a single mom.  Well first of all, I have still 0 appetite so I don‚Äôt bulk eat. I eat very fricking healthy and make all my foods fresh. I eat everything in whole grain, A LOT of veggies and other products that are perfectly fine and healthy. I don‚Äôt drink any soda‚Äôs AT ALL as I don‚Äôt like carbonic (bubbles). and I work 2 jobs where I walk the whole day. I did a lot of sports the last 10 years (professional kickboxing) and did food restrictions for years. I am NOT extreme overweight, yes I carry a little weight but thats because of other medical issues where she paid 0 attention to. I also gained only 4,5 Kilograms in my pregnancy so far. and on top of it my blood pressure is LOW. like super low.

A lot of my morning sickness was likely from my poor eating habits and it‚Äôs getting better as I go. I have very irregular periods due to pcos, but started to have fairly regular periods after I miscarried in April. Because of this, I‚Äôm assuming I‚Äôm anywhere from 3 weeks-9 weeks pregnant right now. Last time it took me almost 2 months to find a doctor willing to take me because everyone wasn‚Äôt accepting new patients, and I miscarried before my appointment. This time I‚Äôve called all of the ob offices in my area that accept my insurance, and they are all supposedly not accepting patients either. I haven‚Äôt been to an ob since I was 16 due to a traumatic experience, and last time it was my ‚Äúlack of medica history‚Äù that made it hard to get an appointment. I did find an office that schedules online, and a few of their doctors have multiple appointments open. It won‚Äôt let me schedule online for pregnancy, and when I called the receptionist began to take my info for an appointment until I mentioned a positive pregnancy test and she told me that none of the doctors at that practice are accepting patients. The only other practice I know of is 40 min away and doesn‚Äôt accept my insurance, but a lot of people Ik recommend them. I have a feeling most doctors are denying me just because I‚Äôm pregnant, maybe there‚Äôs a baby boom in my area lol. What should I do? Would it be rude of me to schedule an annual and let them find out? I don‚Äôt really want to do that but that or going to a normal check up for a referral seems like my best option. Last time we went to a womens care center and they were the only reason we knew something was wrong, but they aren‚Äôt doctors and can‚Äôt provide any medical care. I‚Äôve seen midwives be recommended, but I thought they won‚Äôt help with high risk pregnancies (which I think mine would be because of my pcos and history). I also live in a rural area, so I‚Äôm not sure if there would be many midwives in the area. I have been taking prenatals since February, but want to make sure I at least get basic care. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve been too picky as there‚Äôs only 3 doctors I‚Äôm trying to avoid based on reviews. Any advice while I keep searching?",

    "self_text": "Am I wrong or does that seem so late?? Like I should be halfway through my pregnancy before confirming any issues, if there are multiples, past the NT scan time, so on and so forth?? I don‚Äôt want a ton of ultrasounds or anything but that seems‚Ä¶like too little? I went in today for blood work (I had an ectopic that left me down a tube so they‚Äôre confirming I don‚Äôt have another) and asked about an 8 week appointment and they looked so perplexed and said they do that one by phone??   Im in the US, is this common here? I have good health insurance and I‚Äôm so confused and freaked out (only 5 weeks along) I‚Äôm considering looking for another provider. Am I wrong in feeling so worked up and upset? I teared up at the desk and am waiting on a nurse to call me tomorrow and I‚Äôm hoping the front desk women were wrong.  EDIT: this got so much attention! Thank you all for encouraging me to advocate for myself. I got them to schedule me for an appointment today where I got to talk to the doctor directly. He brought in like a little side cart ultrasound and confirmed it‚Äôs in the right place, heartily agreed to a 7/8 week ultrasound, and a blood trisomy test at 10-12 weeks. He answered all of my questions and I feel way better. I did have another doctor‚Äôs office that agreed to take me had i not felt good about the appointment, but I think I want to stick with my original for now after our face to face.",

I have been suffering with intestinal issues consistently now for the last month. I have lost weight since the month before I found out I was pregnant - 7lbs - and that‚Äôs not normal for me, I hang pretty consistently around the same weight all year, and have to consciously diet hard to lose weight.  I don‚Äôt think the weight loss is from cutting snacks, I wasn‚Äôt eating that many to begin with, and for the last week I have begun regular snacking again in the hope to stop my weight dropping, and it hasn‚Äôt gained me anything back.  Weirdly I think it‚Äôs the whole foods that is doing it.   This makes no sense to me, I‚Äôve never had an issue with my regular diet and all of a sudden it is causing me serious gastric issues.

I've thought through and considered every negative scenario. My OB said they cannot administer anxiety medication during the procedure because it can negatively affect the baby. I honestly feel like I am going to lose my mind with fear and wont be able to pull through the surgery and I can't snap out of it.

Last night at 13 weeks pregnant, I was chilling, watching TV and wanted a bagel, I go into the kitchen throw it in the toaster and suddenly feel like I've leaked a little pee.

I grab a plastic grocery bag hug it to my crotch and run upstairs to the bathroom. The second I sit on the pot I feel clots gushing out and I can hear a full stream of blood gushing into the toilet.  It sounded like I was peeing again.   As I'm frantically calling my husband's job to get him to rush home and take me to the hospital the blood stops. I got him within 20 minutes and he gets home as fast as he can.   While he was coming home, I sat on the side of the tub and hosed the dried blood off of everywhere put on some granny panties and the biggest overnight pad, and half ass cleaned up the murder scenes around the house.   My husband grabs me, we head to the ER and besides my blood pressure (understandably) everything looks fine. Baby has a heartbeat, no SCH, my bloodwork is fine just have low potassium.   I havent bled since. I'm supposed to go back to the ER in 2 days to repeat testing.    TLDR: I bled a LOT for a short period of time all my blood work came back normal, the ultrasound is normal and I'm terrified it'll happen again because the was seemingly no reason in the first place.",

Uh great idea, except I have no idea what all I need to write down so I can check them off! Any advice? I have a bassinet, crib (no mattress yet, yes that's on the list), changing table, dresser, stroller and car seats. My registry is out there. Invites for baby shower to go out in the next week.

For those who don‚Äôt know, prenatal massage is explicitly done using Swedish sweeping techniques.

    "self_text": "I had my first midwife appointment this week (17 weeks) and she brought up the fact that they recommend that anyone the baby is in close contact with for the first 6 weeks of life should have the whooping cough booster. I‚Äôve since done my research and I understand how serious the implications of whooping cough can be for a newborn. My partner and I will be getting the booster and most of my friends already have had the booster recently. Over the past few years my parents have become staunch anti vaxxers, so I‚Äôm really dreading asking them to get the booster. My fianc√©e‚Äôs stance is that anyone who meets the baby before 6 weeks must have it, but I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs reasonable to suggest my parents can see the baby at a short distance (1 metre, outside?) but not hold her if they refuse the whooping cough vaccine? When I got the covid jabs it caused a huge issue with my mum and I, she basically bombarded me with her ‚Äúresearch‚Äù about the harm the vaccines can cause and said some quite hurtful things to me when I told her I was going to get the vax, so I can imagine she might try and do the same thing with the whooping cough one. I know for a fact they will refuse to get the booster, but I‚Äôll try to educate them of course. My parents live in the same city as us and we‚Äôre very close (I‚Äôm able to sort of put aside their anti vax beliefs for the sake of keeping the peace most of the time). I feel like if I said they can‚Äôt see their grand daughter for 6 weeks it might cause a huge family rift. I know it‚Äôs early days and I have a while before I need to tell them but it‚Äôs playing on my mind a lot and I wonder if telling them sooner is better? Any advice on how to best approach this, or experiences with a similar situation would be greatly appreciated! Thank you.",

    "self_text": "Wanted to post this here as this was literally such a fear of mine during pregnancy and last night that fear came true and it ended up being a blessing in disguise. I'm posting this because I hope it helps someone else get over their fears as I know this is a common one.   So ever since I found out I was pregnant i knew I wanted an epidural during delivery. I always had mad respect for women being able to deliver unmedicated but personally, i didn't want to put my body through that kind of pain fearing that it may leave me traumatized for the next baby. I of course knew there was a risk of not being able to get the epidural but I was hopeful that this would not happen.  Cut to last night when hubby and i arrive to the hospital with pretty strong contractions that had been going on for some hours and getting stronger. I was registered at the delivery department and they checked my cervix, which to everyone's surprise was at 6cm already. I asked for the epidural and was told the anesthesiologist would be by soon but was stuck in an operation and so i would need to wait a little while longer. Cut to two hours later, still no sign of the anesthesiologist and suddenly the midwife tells me I'm dilated 10cm, which was not surprising to me considering how strong my contractions felt.   I finally get told that the anesthesiologist is free but that at this point it's really no point in getting the epidural since it won't take away the pressure of the pushing phase anyway. So i labour on, unmedicated. After one hour of pushing, my beautiful baby girl appears and I have honestly never been prouder of myself. Even though it was painful and hard and I felt like giving up at times, my body really showed me what it can do and I gained a whole new sense of self respect.   I guess my point is, labour is unpredictable and going in with a rock solid plan that you're not willing to deviate from might not be in your best interest, even though it's of course ok to have hopes and expectations. Our bodies are capable of amazing things and the best thing you can do during labour is trust your body that it knows what it's doing.   Good luck to anyone else getting closer to labour. I hope you all get the delivery you wish for, and if not, i hope your experience still turns out positive.",

Our house is paid off and neither of us have loan debt. We will be looking at a new car in the next year or so because mine is 10+ years old with over 350k miles. But financially we‚Äôre doing really very well. When we discovered I was pregnant he wanted to make sure we would be comfortable next year so he picked up a part time job on weekends. At first it was just Sundays. Then his normal job picked up with overtime. So he is now working 10 hour days 3 days a week, all day Saturday, and all day Sunday.   I understand that this is going to help us in the long run, but I feel so alone. I‚Äôm nearly 16 weeks and have so much work to do at the house to prep the nursery and get the house baby ready. We started renovations during the pandemic and still have work like putting down baseboard and hanging out new doors, work I can‚Äôt do right now. He‚Äôs never home on weekends to help with this and he‚Äôs too tired the week nights he is home. I understand why, but I‚Äôm starting to feel resentful and can‚Äôt logic my way out of it. How can I confront these feelings? What would you all do? I understand I am incredibly privileged to be in a position where I can be a SAHM for a few years.",

She's also an amazing cook and loves to do it. But since she's been here, she's been off her game a bit hygiene-wise. We've noticed 99% (not one bit of exaggeration) of the dishes she handwashes are still (VERY) dirty and put away wet. I've tried talking to her about it but she's also very sensitive and I'm trying to stay obviously grateful for her presence. I think I may have to talk to her about this latest thing though...  She cut chicken on the same cutting board she afterwards washed (?) and then cut salad toppings. I asked specifically for a pre-washed salad to have with dinner tonight because I love salad. She went out of her way to get toppings I love at the store. I feel terrible that I can't in good conscience eat any of it. And neither can my son. I've tried convincing my husband to go for it, his body is much more capable of the risk. But I don't think he's going to go for it either.

For this pregnancy, I have little appetite and some food aversions. I do crave Starbucks green tea lemonade and straight Coca Cola, particularly McDonald's Coke. I can't stand to drink any other soda. I also am eating more protein because my headaches are bad, but my Fall allergies are really bad this time of year too.  I KNOW every pregnancy is different, and my last two are 16 months apart, where this one will be 28 months apart from my youngest boy, so maybe my age has something to do with it (I am 33 currently, and was 30 and 31 when i had my boys). I'm just so curious to hear other people's cravings or experiences carrying different genders or all the same genders. We would love a daughter, but we are ecstatic with another boy. I'm just grateful to be pregnant.",

They have been trying for a year now and had one ectopic pregnancy in that time. Last we saw each other (about 4 months ago) my husband and I had not expressed wanting children, so it may be something that seems out of the blue to her. I want to be aware of how she will be feeling, for example sadness or jealousy that she isn't expecting, and make sure it doesn't come across as 'rubbing it in'. I saw a video saying to text them so they can process in private but it seems almost like avoiding telling them, but I also want to give them space to process. Maybe over FaceTime? How would you approach this?  Edited for additional information. My friend has long standing mental health issues on top of struggling with her fertility so I am worried about her reaction and trying to be a gentle as possible when I do tell her and her husband (her husband is my initial friend in the relationship - long time university friend)",

At the appointment today I finally really realised what it could mean, last week all I got was \"oh it might be nothing\" and no real explanation. Of course I had an idea but I managed not to really think about it. Apparently one of the three hormonal levels in the regular blood test also showed slightly abnormal levels but both the nuchal translucency and nasal bones were perfect. My chances of trisomy 21 were set as 1 to 82. Today, in repeat ultrasound ductus venosus flow was perfect also. Little thing had grown over half a centimeter also with only 5 days. Very energetic. It is almost impossible to find any information about if ductus venosus flow normalising is a good sign or not.  My NIPT test results will arrive middle of next week at the latest and because of how my placenta is placed I can still have a biopsy then as needed even though I will be 14 weeks.  I feel lost, heartbroken and defeated. I know I should wait for the test results but I really do have a bad feeling about it. I want my little one to be healthy so bad.  Today has been a shitty day and I just need someone to I don't know. Listen, perhaps?

I was scheduled for a medical induction for medication controlled GD at 38w4d, but the hospital was full, so I instead got put on an over 20 person waiting list. Finally, this past Sunday at 39w6d around 4 am, they called us to tell us they had an open bed and to make our way to the hospital within the hour.  Once we arrived and got to our room, they checked me and I was 0 cm dilated with a posterior cervix but ‚Äúsoft.‚Äù They inserted Cervidil vaginally and instructed me to leave it in for 12 hours. Over time, I started having some minor contractions about 7 minutes apart. 12 hours passed and when they took out the Cervidil to check me, I was still 0 cm dilated but seemed to be more effaced, although they didn‚Äôt give me a number.   They decided to start me on Cytotec 50 mcg orally every 4 hours. I started having more powerful and more frequent contractions, about 3-4 minutes apart. I got up out of bed and moved around more, doing squats and swaying. They came to give me my second dose 4 hours later and as soon as the nurse left the room, I felt a warm gush of fluid between my legs. I called the nurse back and confirmed my water broke! We decided to give it a few more hours before doing another cervical check, as they were painful to me with a posterior facing cervix.  4 hours later around 0500, they check me and I‚Äôm 1.5 cm dilated but almost completely effaced with a less posterior cervix. I was pretty discouraged at this point and started to come to terms with the possibility of a c-section. The contractions were pretty painful, lasting about 2 minutes in length with only a minute break in between. I asked for an epidural at this point because I couldn‚Äôt tolerate the pain.  After the epidural was placed around 0400, I finally felt relief and decided to get some rest. I asked to hold off on Pitocin, since I was still having frequent contractions. At shift change around 0700, my new nurse walked in and talked with me about starting Pitocin to increase strength of contractions. I agreed to start it, but my OB walked in the room to check me, and said I was 10 cm and the baby‚Äôs head was right there! We thought she was joking.  I pushed for under an hour, had a second degree tear and a small periurethral tear from pushing her out so quickly. She is 7lb11oz of pure cuteness. Feeling very in love and so grateful that my body responded and dilated! I hope this gives someone hope who is also starting from 0 cm dilated!",

For background, I‚Äôm scared about what all these screens nowadays will do to our little one, and we plan to avoid them around the kid within reason. I want to do what‚Äôs best for the kid but not break our bank and time.  The daycare we visited yesterday had the following pros and cons:  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  PROS:  -walking distance from our house  -affordable  -an older lady watches the kids with lots of years of experience.  -we know someone that has their kid there so more trusted  -willing to deal with reusable diapers   -flexible on sickness (if it‚Äôs just a cold can still send the kid in)  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  CONS:  -They all stay in 1 room all day, don‚Äôt go outside as far as I know.  -There is a TV in the room and is on ALL DAY on PBS. This is mainly for the lady‚Äôs comfort cause she doesn‚Äôt like silence.  -No educational type or any programming just babysitter type care (we‚Äôd have our kid here till they go to preschool).

I wanted to keep it between me and my husband because I wanted to be able to peacefully move on without having to tell others.   My mom found out at 12 weeks and was super upset about it. She couldn't understand why I wouldn't tell her even after I explained time and time again. We're a close family so she didn't understand why I just wanted it to be kept close to the chest until we knew more about what was going to happen. I bleed heavily until 14 weeks.   I told the rest of my family when I was 15 weeks and instead of anyone being happy they were upset I didn't say anything sooner. I don't understand how they don't understand the position I was in. How do I handle this moving forward? No one seems happy about a new baby, just upset I kept it a secret.",

    "self_text": "I keep getting stuck in bed and in chairs, PTs continue to say that it's just from the relaxin and tell me to continue the exercises my original PT gave. There's also instructions for a weird \"log roll\" where I basically move all of my body at once to get up from a laying position.  Well after a month of trying these exercises and methods of getting up and down for both laying and sitting, I was getting stuck more frequently and it's gotten to the point where moving my head/neck hurts my hips and lower back more. So I went back and told to just keep trying and following the instructions, two more weeks went by and it got bad enough that I was (and still am) on the verge of crying and occasionally crying if I'm moving myself to a sitting position (from standing) or if I'm laying down or getting up.  The advice after that? Get a new pregnancy pillow. So that's exactly what I did, it still hasn't helped. I ditched the exercises as soon as my hips started to pop every time I walked, but I'm now at the point where I'm going to see other PTs who give me the same advice and the cycle of pain just restarts. A pregnancy belt doesn't help, hot and cold compresses don't help either. I can't keep going to physical therapists as it's a $500 prepay every time.  I've been sleeping with three pillows under my head which makes my neck stiff, two under my tailbone, and on my back just to avoid getting stuck and needing my husband to help me up. This helps a little but not a lot, my hips still pop every time I walk too and moving my head/neck hurts my back and hips still. Thankfully I am prescribed a medication that I'm able to take that makes it easier to fall asleep but I need something better.  Please does anyone have any advice? I'm exhausted and in pain, tired of going to therapists, and I'd rather just get hip replacements at this point.",

    "self_text": "I am so sorry for this, but I am starting to absolutely hate doctors. Today I (27, FTM) had a meeting with a nutritionist - she warned me against drinking coffee (I drink one cup every other day, but even before getting pregnant I didnt drink it that much) as it can cause heart problems and arithmia in the baby. She urged me not to drink sparkling water as it has a lot (by her words) sodium (it was a nice way to stay hydrated) :( . Advised me to check if my baby is developing normally as soon as possible. Previously the gynecologist advised I dont do much excercise and be more calm even if before I used to have a very active lifestyle.  I mean... what the hell. I get that they dont want to be held responisble if something happens to my baby, but surely I am not to lead my life being scared by these professionals. Could it be they are not very updated on their information? On top of that ofcourse I feel frustrated and very emotional about this üòÑ  Edit to clarify: I do not have a high risk pregnancy, all my results have come back within the standard",

    "self_text": "I just need to vent some of my icky feelings about my MIL. My MIL is very sweet, we have a good relationship, but she often times just does what she thinks is best without thought of others. She‚Äôs hosting my baby shower since my family is in a different state. I told her what our theme and colors were. We are doing wildflower and woodland creatures with earth tones. We‚Äôre having a girl and I just do not want all the pink and purple and whatnot and I‚Äôve made that pretty clear since we found out the gender.  She gave me our baby shower invites this weekend and I was so heartbroken. The invited are all silver, purple, and some pink. They‚Äôre handmade and I do love the handmade aspect, it really touched my heart she cared enough to make them. I guess I shouldn‚Äôt care so much about the colors and whatnot, but my work friends had a baby shower for me at work and made sure it was on theme after just one convo about it. I‚Äôm worried now everyone is going to think we‚Äôre doing silver and purple, though.  The invites were also mostly about my stepdaughter becoming a big sister, and not really about me and the baby. They all say ‚Äújoin stepdaughter in welcoming her new sister - along with the expecting parents‚Äù I have my stepdaughter full time (mom isn‚Äôt really involved) and I love her so much. My whole world revolves around her so I was looking forward to a day that wasn‚Äôt all about my stepdaughter and instead about me and our new baby.  I talked to my MIL about this and she said ‚Äúwell I figured purple would tell people it‚Äôs a girl.‚Äù Everyone knows it‚Äôs a girl. And when I mentioned how I was sad that the invites were all about my stepdaughter she said ‚Äúwell I did that for my second son and his brother‚Äù. And I may feel differently about if this wasn‚Äôt my first bio-baby, but it still didn‚Äôt sit right with me or my partner. The first thing my partner said when he saw the invites was that my stepdaughter shouldn‚Äôt have been the center of focus.   Anyway, she stopped by later that day with a bunch of craft supplies and said we could redo the invites together, which was very sweet. I really didn‚Äôt want to have to put in the work and I told her I was going to use the ones she made anyway because she already made them and I just wanted her to know how I was feeling. I have to do a little extra additions to the invites to make sure one theme is clear and I need to put our registry link in. When she stopped by she also brought some baby clothes and pulled an outfit out and said ‚Äúthis is the baby‚Äôs coming home outfit‚Äù and I got really sad again. I always felt like that was something mom and dad should pick out so I was confused why she went ahead and did it, especially after I told her I already had one picked out like two weeks prior. When she gave it to me, I told her again that I already had one and she just pursed her lips and changed the subject.   These instances along with others has just made me feel like such an afterthought in my own pregnancy and I‚Äôm just bummed out about it. It makes me miss my friends and family back home and makes me feel even more alone where we are living. I know if I was back home my mom and best friend would make sure it was what I wanted and that I felt special, not like an afterthought.",

I was scheduled for 39 +3 and got pushed back until 39+4 and delivered at 39 +5. So at my 39 week check up I was 1cm and couldn‚Äôt do a membrane sweep. When I went in for my induction the following Monday, I was still 1cm. I talked with the Dr and decided to start with cervidil gel to soften the cervix. My goal was to avoid pitocin and delay and expidural as long as possible. I was able to eat and drink my whole labor as long as no epidural or pitocin. So the gel went in and I started having contractions and vagina burning around the 6 hour mark. I received stadol which just made me super high and I slept a bit. That night they took out the gel and I got 2 doses of cytotec 4 hours apart. I had back labor all night and I was constantly changing positions. I had a wireless monitor that needed to be switched to the regular one. I got frequent breaks and was able to move freely. I received 3 doses of fentanyl for pain over the course of 13 hours. By morning I was in agony and I was able to take a shower. My contractions and back labor were becoming unbearable. I asked for an epidural around 9 am. I was only 2 cm dilated but I was 70% effaced and he was low in my pelvis. I was able to sit still for the epidural and the dr was so quick and I felt a pinch and that‚Äôs it. Well no sooner was I numb, 15 min later but the baby was dropping his heart rate and recovering. So the nurse checked me and I was 7 cm. They flipped me from side to side and then all fours. They checked me again and I was 9cm and the dr was on her way. The dr arrived and I was 10cm. I could still feel pressure but nothing like before. I pushed 3 times and he was born! No tearing, no cuts and no stitches. I delivered the placenta and had some bleeding. She massaged m uterus and I got an injection in my thigh. He was born one hour after the epidural. All my nurses were great and I had a really good experience. Labor is the most intense and painful thing I ever experienced but the epidural was amazing.",

Well now in at the hospital with pain meds for the contractions and walking then out until I'm able to have my baby.

    "self_text": "Today I worked in the hospital as usual, my hours were recently reduced from my OB because I was working 10-11 HR shifts and not taking care of myself the way I should be, meaning sitting tf down when I should, because welp we are over worked at the hospital and never seem to have enough staff on hand to run out blood lab Dept.   Welp, today I worked my little 4 hour shift which feels like absolute nonsense to me since I have been working since 13, I think that's the last time I worked this little, but now what I do is I try to do everything before the next person comes in and still overdo a little, but I DO sit my butt down when I feel exhausted now. It's definitely a learning curve to do this though!   I went pee around my 4 hour mark and my underwear were soaked, I was wearing a dress and it hadn't made it thru that material so that was confusing, but I guess maternity dresses have thicker material for just these reasons. It didn't smell like pee, there was some white discharge and the liquid was clear, so I assumed oh ok maybe it's just some weird new pregnancy fluid, then I started cramping and baby boy stopped kicking. ENSUE THE PANIC, but not at the disco, at WORK. I called my bf to tell him and my manager was in the room when I did so, she started freaking out which then made me freak out, they brought a wheelchair from the maternity ward and everything to come get me, TALK ABOUT EMBARRASSED, I ofc started crying bc now I'm thinking Theres no way my water just broke, because my baby isn't due till December 20th, that's a full 38 days away hunni.  Welp my bf gets there, also panicked, but doesn't have our bags with him which made me feel better actually. Then they say their going to test the fluid, takes them mins. And she sticks a stick up my vag for a full 3 mins. Does a little.sponnt spin and makes me cough a few times. Test takes 10 mins. Ok cool. I wait. IT WAS PEE mixed with discharge. I came up to the maternity ward and caused all this hoopla bc I peed myself.   When I tell you this pregnancy has been one of my most humbling experiences in my life, this is the shit no one tells you about, the randomly peeing yourself, the other day I took a shower and while the water was hitting my belly he did a flip that made me poop, IN THE SHOWER, I haven't told anyone bc that's also HIGHLY EMBARASSING. I simply put bleach and comet down the drain like nut job. The smells I'm craving also weird I want to smell alcohol, bleach, white out, and like cleaning supplies constantly, but since I work at a hospital I simple smell purrell all day and sanicloths. Literally so friggin embarrassing. No one tells you growing a human is beautiful and amazing but also your body and hormones are going to betray you a little bit before their here, maybe it's just to prepare you for the pee and poop that will get on you in he beginning stages of their lives but seriously what the heck man.",

I'm also terrified this nausea will persist beyond 12 weeks and I really don't want to keep feeling this way and being unable to eat what essentially would be good for me and the baby. I don't eat unhealthily, I just mostly can stomach blander foods like toast and yogurt, fruit when I can handle it, sandwiches or soup - everything with a lot of difficulty and not in normal quantities.

Right before I found out I was pregnant( possibly around the time of conception) my doctors and I found out I had a heart murmur. I am 30 yo and this had never occurred before. Since then they have been monitoring both my baby and my heart, because we have learned I have a mild aortic stenosis. Apparently, pregnant women with this condition are advised to be induced at 37 weeks for preventative measures. So, I might get induced next week (Dec. 6th, 2022).   I have not really looked at information about inducing because I have heard horror stories of it. I wanted to try to do 100% natural and whenever the baby was ready (still planning on natural birth) but for mine and the baby‚Äôs health, we are going to induce. I am a bit nervous, I have no idea what it‚Äôs like, what the process is, how long it will take, and I don‚Äôt have that many women in my circle that know about induction.  If you have been induced, what was it like? How long were you in labor? How early/late were you when you were induced? Did you or anyone you knew also have heart conditions while pregnant?

My friends are also getting excited about the stag and the best man is going to start organising it soon which will also be overseas.

I tried pounding on the door and yelling his name and he could not hear me, plus obviously the hysterical kid he was ignoring. His phone is on silent so I can‚Äôt actually wake him up that way.   Everything is fine but what if I wasn‚Äôt? What if I went into labor or was throwing up and needed help? I‚Äôm third trimester now, a lot could happen, hell, what if the house was on fire?   He‚Äôs normally a great partner and we don‚Äôt have issues but I am next level angry he‚Äôd be selfish enough to lock his door. I don‚Äôt get that luxury, my kids are my priority. They should be his too! It‚Äôs probably an accident but he has a text telling him if this shit ever happens again he‚Äôs waking up to me and the baby gone because there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm staying with someone who would be that fucking selfish.   That‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs the rant, I‚Äôm just angry as fuck and needed to get it out since it‚Äôs 4 am and I‚Äôm comforting a hysterical toddler while he snores away happily blissfully.",

Went to get assessed in the emergency department. Was told I‚Äôm fine ( no physical checks or ultrasound done) and sent home. Next day I have unbearable pain,bleeding and vomiting as well. Passes a large clot like substance ( about 4cm) and pain went away instantly. My question is no one mentioned anything about a subchronionic hematoma. Could I have passed the fetus?",

    "self_text": "Good morning, I‚Äôm 35 weeks pregnant and just had my baby shower Saturday. It was great! My sister in law and friend did a really great job hosting and setting everything up. I had a blast and I know my baby is loved and will be loved when she is born. The one thing about this that is aggravating me atm is the fact no one on my side of the family that I invited showed. My sil from that side is asking me how it went and honestly debating just keeping a healthy distance type of relationship with them. My own mother didnt even show. She didnt call or text or let anyone know that she wasnt coming. I shouldnt be all that upset because she has never been there for me to begin with. But still i fill like my relationships with other members of my family were affected because of her. She doesnt like anyone in her family and i didnt invite anyone else in my family to save drama( did the same thing for my wedding) she showed up for 10 minutes and left. I couldve invited other members of my family that wouldnve been more supportive but i chose her. She shows no interest when i want to include her on things but guilt trips me whenever i dont do what she wants me to do.   My second issue is that i really want a woman ( my mother inlaw expressed interest and ive been thinking about asking her before she told me) in the room with me at birth but my husband wants just us to experience this ‚Äúspecial moment‚Äù and that im taking away this special moment from us. He also said that i made him feel bad like he isnt enough that i need someone else in the room too. Honestly I‚Äôm just tired of constantly butting heads and made to feel bad. I want another female family member in the room with me because i feel like because she knows what im going through that she can be more supportive and advocate for me. My husband hasnt done a thing preparing himself for this birth and im afraid he doesn‚Äôt understand why i want someone whose been through this. This is our first child.  I also want to say that I asked my husband if we can do something together one last time before the baby is born. There is a concert a day before the baby is born and I expressed interest and even told him it would be fun to make this a pleasant memory before parenthood but he said no because our baby‚Äôs due date is the next day. I tried telling him that doesnt mean I‚Äôll go into labor on that day but he still insisted that we just stay home. Im upset because I dont ever get out of the house often and I thought it would be a great way to have this as a good memory. Am i wrong for that? I feel like im constantly making poor choices that he doesnt agree with and it upsets me to the point i never go anywhere because he either tells me he‚Äôs not interested or that i need to be able to do things on my own. Yet Im the bad guy when I do go out and do things on my own because I didnt invite him. Am I crazy for wanting to go to a concert the day before our child‚Äôs due date? I cant help they are only in our area that day. (He‚Äôs already been to one of their concerts but I‚Äôve never been and told him for years I want to go and it just so happens i checked and they still have seats available)",

I don‚Äôt want to be deceitful, but I also want to protect myself.   Also, any second time moms that live in Washington state? I‚Äôve been here for three years, but work remotely for a company in another state (same with potential new company). Do I qualify for state parental leave?   THANK YOU SO MUCH!",

So when he's born he could struggle to breathe or eat. However 1 surgery and sorted  2- they couldn't see his left ulna and think his hand will be clubbed as a result  3- he's not growing very well, his stomach only measured at 18w 5 days at the scan I was 20+2.  He moves so much though everyone's struggling to get a good view, he just doesn't stay still. They ruled his kidneys as inconclusive as they couldn't get a good view to see them both he moved so much.   We had a meeting to discuss the results and were advised with 3 issues they're normally linked and the odds are he'll have a syndrome or chromosome issue. We've got a scan at a specialist unit booked for tomorrow and they're wanting us to have an amniotic fluid test (forgot the name of the procedure)   I don't really know what I'm expecting by posting this but I just feel so angry and heartbroken. And mostly scared for the future. 1 in 100 women miscarry after having the amniotic fluid taken. Yet without it we won't know if there is something more life changing going on with him. He kicks constantly and moves so much at scans, surely that's a sign of a healthy baby.",

It was good I did because baby boy's heart rate was dropping after contractions,  which said he's stressed. They pumped me with fluids and monitored him for 6 hours.

She said my cervix is already towards the front of my pelvis and lowering. I'm leaking all the other drainage, but my waters haven't broken.

    "self_text": "Ok. This is very long, but I'd really, really appreciate any thoughts anyone might have.   About 2 months ago my partner had a big falling out with a close friend over text. Long story short, it started when we got a cat for our little boy, which immediately disappeared. (The cat, it turned out, was hiding in the kitchen cabinets and came out after a day or two) We thought she may have escaped somehow and we were all really worried and upset. My partner said something like \"well, if we don't find her we could get him another cat...\" and our friend accused us of being irresponsible and not grieving enough. We were pretty upset and my partner was just trying to think of solutions. Everything then super escalated and the friend said quite a few hurtful things. Then she accused my partner of being manipulative out of the blue and said she didn't want to see us again for some time.   I'm pretty cut by the things she said. Now we (my partner and I) haven't spoken to them (friend and partner) for several weeks. I'm really saddened by this. They are both really precious to me and my little boy adores them and calls them \"Aunty x and x\" and I don't know what to say when he asks when we'll see them again. I'm due in a few weeks. It feels weird that they're not going to meet the baby or be around at all.  Here's another detail though. They've been TTC for years and are mid-IVF. I want to be supportive during what I know is a really gruelling and stressful process but if roles were reversed, my (8 months) pregnant friend would be the last person I'd want to talk to. I can't help but wonder if this is an underlying issue but I have no idea how to address it.  What should I do? Should I reach out to them? Would that violate her \"don't talk to me\" boundary? Should I confront her about the horrible things she said? Should I just accept that the friendship is gone forever?",

    "self_text": "Hello! Long-time lurker on Reddit, but I got a lot out of this sub while I was pregnant because I was lucky enough that many questions and experiences others had on this sub coincided with my own. I thought I might share my complete pregnancy/birth experience for anyone newly pregnant that might be curious. It's VERY long, so please feel free to skip :)  tl;dr = beginning-to-end description of my low-risk, FTM, intentional pregnancy and birth experience along with thoughts and recommendations from me and my partner   Background:    I can't stress how unbelievably LUCKY I was throughout this entire process, so please enjoy a positive birth story, and I wish everyone else the best of luck!!  US-based, first-time mom with super supportive partner and family members, and we actively tried for a baby.  Reasonably fit, but recently non-active due to a knee injury and surgery/recovery.  Sister was also pregnant/FTM and 7 weeks ahead of me.  Healthy vaginal delivery at 41w4d. Currently 6 weeks postpartum!    First Tri:    My Experience: Nausea started for me around w5-6 and didn't end until w20 or so; I threw up every single day at least once for about 9 weeks and ended up on doxylamine which helped a lot with no adverse effects. Fatigue was exhausting - thinking about exercise  literally  made me need to sit down for a few minutes. Morning sickness and fatigue was honestly the worst I had to deal with during my pregnancy. My sister had the more common experience and had some bad nausea for about 2 weeks between w8-10. The good news: nausea means you're less likely to miscarriage (but lack of nausea isn't a risk factor).  Partner Experience (his words): Big struggle with inability to \"solve\" (or otherwise address) the misery of the nausea. (my words) He picked up the slack on a LOT of chores (pet care, dishes, laundry, etc.) while I was basically catatonic for several weeks.  Unsolicited Advice: I lived on three things with morning sickness: FRUIT (particularly watermelon), simple carbs (particularly peanut butter crackers, but also bagels with cream cheese), and Dr. Oetker frozen pizzas (if you haven't had them, highly recommend). Salad was the fastest way to make me hurl. I still don't go anywhere without Ritz PB crackers (carbs and protein) and my water bottle...    Second Tri:    My Experience: I HATED that people referred to the second trimester as an energy boost... I never felt like I got back my original energy; I just felt better than I did during the first trimester / stopped throwing up all the time. I also started to feel my baby kick, and personally loved it! Otherwise, this just felt like the waiting period.  Partner Experience (his words): The relief at the end of the nausea marathon (month s !) was immense. It felt like a return to happy couple affection, after a rough \"ineffectual caretaker\" span.    Third Tri:    My Experience: I worked up until the last minute because I wasn't willing to waste a day of leave, so I worked full-time until w40 and part-time until 41w1d. I was full-time remote and my contract was ending, so this was actually possible for me (again, lucky). My OB kept putting off scheduling an induction, so they didn't schedule it until 41w4d which annoyed me tremendously... and then I ended up going into labor on my own earlier that same day. My legs and fingers started to swell pretty bad around w34, then went back down, but then were MASSIVE around w40. I was worried about preeclampsia a few times, but didn't have any issues.  Partner Experience (his words): The not-knowing was tough. We were primed and ready basically from 36w onwards, \"any day now!\" Once 38w came and went we both started to get more and more annoyed with everyone's questions (\"Have the baby yet?\" Obviously not, you jabroni) and summaries (\"So I guess no baby yet...\" Good guess, you jabroni). Was furious with our OB group for putting off our induction scheduling that we'd been asking for constantly until after we wanted, and finding out the delay had substantial effect on baby's options (our state has a statutory hardline on September 30th/October 1st for kindergarten eligibility).  Unsolicited Advice: My birth plan was very minimal (basically no episiotomy) in part because I didn't want to \"plan\" for an epidural or \"plan\" for vaginal delivery, so that I wasn't disappointed if my plan didn't work out. For example, my partner was surprised that an epidural wasn't definitely part of my plan, but I wanted to take each step as it came up, and that was the healthiest mindset for me. Unsurprisingly, pain sucks and I said bring on the epidural! However, feelings are feelings and there's not much you can do when they come around. When it seemed like an induction was inevitable, I was pretty frustrated because it felt like my body was failing to do what it needed to. At the highest level, I could identify this wasn't true, but it didn't stop the feelings from occurring. My sister was also very disappointed when she needed a C-section (and the knowledge that a vaginal birth in the future was much less likely). When she tried to hide her tears in the moment, her nurse told her \"It's okay to be disappointed and cry. Cry now and then get it done after.\" Once again -- nurses are amazing.    Birth:    My Experience: I was only 0.5cm dilated at my w40 appointment and maybe 1cm dilated by w41. I was scheduled for induction at 9pm on w41d4, and then I started contractions around 4am that same day. I watched TV while my contractions progressed and tracked them on an app. Around 9am I woke my partner up to let him know in case he had anything he wanted to do, but I didn't think I was close yet. By 10:30am I was calling the OB asking to come in because they were pretty rough and 2:1:1 (2 minutes apart, 1 minute long, for over an hour), but she said to hold off because they weren't painful enough (I could still walk and talk through them). By 11am they were that painful and I told my husband  FUCK IT  we're going and we left! When I got to the hospital, my OB didn't want to admit me because I was only 2cm dilated, but conceded because I was scheduled to be induced later that evening. We were not going to drive the 30min home anyways, so it was a question of whether we were milling around the hospital or going through the triage process. Went through that (triage nurses were wonderful). OB then also tried to discourage an epidural. I'd read epidurals can often slow labor progression, but I got the epidural around 1-1:30pm and was fully dilated and pushing around 5pm. My epidural was PAINLESS, easy, and made it possible for me to relax before the baby and push so much easier. Kudos to the women that didn't need it! After 1.5 hours of pushing (1 hour of pushing comfortably, 30 minutes of painful pushing), we had a baby!! The placenta came out almost effortlessly for me. (I'd heard from others experiences that it was extremely uncomfortable and the doctors had to push on their already painful stomachs to get it out.) I had pretty significant vaginal/perineal tearing, so I had quite a few stitches which were painful even with the epidural. But even with the tearing I had one of the easiest birth stories in all of our friends/family. Most of our friends/family needed unplanned C-sections after struggling with long labors, so my quick and \"easy\" labor/birth was a shock.  Partner Experience (his words): A lot of standing. Not a lot of lifting, walking, or activity -- just a ton of standing. Lower legs were very tired by the end. Fun to make at least one joke about how tired and sore  you  are after the birth. Seeing the baby's head and face sticking out of the mother was a surreal experience. Honestly the whole duration in which the top of the head was visible/touchable was wild. Felt like our OB was almost disinterested in the birth, which was strange. From discouraging our arrival at the hospital to discouraging our admittance to telling the nurse she would keep waiting to show up as we progressed rapidly through stages was very weird. Felt and tried to continuously express immense pride in me through the whole birthing process. (My words:) He was unbelievably supportive throughout the birth and he and the nurse kept the praise coming constantly.  Unsolicited Advice: Bring some house slippers and/or grippy socks that you can walk around the room and into the bathroom in! Common recommendation is to bring your own toiletries so you can shower when you're up for it. Personally, I didn't wear my own clothes until it was time to check-out, while I had a cousin that recommended bringing your own hospital sheets and preferred their clothes. Another personal preference -- I don't wear a ton of makeup, but I put on some simple mascara/eyeliner/under-eye concealer before I left for the hospital... I knew I wasn't going to look perfect, but I wanted to avoid looking like death in my first picture with my baby. I thought it helped! But it was a very silly feeling to be putting on makeup while having extremely painful contractions :)    Postpartum:    My Experience: More blood than you think is possible -- I actually thought I was incontinent briefly because I couldn't tell the difference, but the bleeding slowed to normal period flow around the first week and stopped entirely around 5 weeks for me. Vaginal birth and stitches meant I was definitely sore, but I was walking around just fine within hours after the birth and only used Tylenol/Ibuprofen for pain (though I was on a constant regimen). We stayed in the hospital for 2 nights and technically could have rushed out after 1 night if we really wanted (we didn't). It was exhausting to be in the hospital, but a relief to be surrounded by professionals that could reassure us and examine him constantly. Peri-bottles were useful (like a bidet) and using warm water was much nicer, though cold water was helpful for some extra numbing. I used the hospital-provided mesh undies and massive pads for the first week or two at least and then post partum underwear for weeks after (still am). Our hospital also provided some extremely soft wipes that were great during those first couple days. By 6 weeks (today), I feel basically back to 100% other than breast discomfort, though I still haven't had my first OB follow-up which I found insane and made me extremely uncomfortable. I had some itchiness and tenderness around some of the stitches, but the OB office only recommended sitz baths. I've started working out again in the past week or two, though I learned my sister's OB didn't recommend anything more than yoga/pilates for multiple months (vaginal or C-section). There may be things about your body that are simply different now... e.g., your feet may be larger (my sister has had to replace most of her shoes). I'm still 10-15lbs heavier than pre-pregnancy, so I bought some jeans and clothes that actually fit. No need to shame yourself!  Hormones are insane. I didn't have any mood swings or hormonal outbreaks that I noticed during my entire pregnancy and I've never been particularly impacted during my period, but one of the most stressful things I've ever experienced was abject terror for the first week postpartum that something horrible would happen -- primarily that I or someone would drop the baby. At one point my MIL walked down the steps carrying the baby (slowly and carefully), and I just stared at her and cried as I pictured my baby's lifeless body at the bottom of the stairs. Honestly, these thoughts still pop into my head, but the hormones that first week made them soul-crushing. For the first week, we didn't co-sleep with the baby because I was petrified they would stop breathing if one of us wasn't watching, so my partner stayed up until ~3-5am and I stayed awake when he went to bed.    Partner Experience (his words): I've always tiptoed near insomnia so felt very prepared for the weird/limited sleep schedule a newborn brings, lucky there. Genuine arm soreness from so much baby-carrying, especially in the elbows. Try to look at diaper changing as \"my job\" so it's a pleasant surprise whenever one is changed by anyone else--I actively take over from my partner if I see her start to change him. Success with Nuk and Dr. Brown bottles. Honestly, was prepped for a much less significant emotional connection with baby through the first few weeks -- heard so much about how they don't develop much personality yet and can't really engage, but our baby has been an entertaining delight from day one. Breastfeeding seems like it sucks (heh, dad joke). Lots of science points to baby hearing parent voices speaking different words as being ideal for development, so I try to talk and sing to him nigh-constantly. Moving his body parts around is good for him too, so have fun playing with your baby's arms and legs. Silly fun = healthy growth? I'll take it!  Kick kick kick . (my words) Can confirm - he changes so many diapers!!  Unsolicited Advice: For the past 6 weeks, my partner and I have tried to communicate constantly about where our heads are at. This isn't an easy time, but communicating makes it ten times easier. The focus is often on the mom (which we need and deserve), but I knew how much he was doing too and checked in often to make sure he was happy, comfortable with the load, and getting what he needed too. The two best questions we tend to ask each other is: How are you doing? and Is there something you need from me? / Anything I can do?    Misc:     Doctor Experience:  We really liked our OB group through the pregnancy, but were less thrilled with our OB during delivery. My sister's OB office seemed to be more proactive with care; they provided her with information, materials, etc. as she passed certain thresholds while we needed to ask every question -- we actually had to remind our OB to give me my TDAP after they technically missed the window. Of our OB group, the actual doc we liked the least ended up being the birth doc, of course. The nurses, however, were AMAZING and supportive rockstars. From the moment we entered the hospital to the second we checked out, they were incredible. As was the woman who delivered the epidural ;)   Breastfeeding Experience:  This is where I was a little less lucky... I've been lucky to be able to breastfeed exclusively so far, but unlucky in that it's been pretty painful/uncomfortable. My nipples are constantly sore, my breasts are often engorged and painful, and milk is constantly leaking EVERYWHERE. The pain reduced significantly 2 weeks pp and my supply has started regulating by 5 weeks, but I'm still hoping for significantly more regulation of my supply in the next couple weeks (which is what I've heard from others).  I've been told constantly that pain is NOT normal and you do NOT need to just deal with it. Unfortunately, I've been \"just dealing with it\" at times, but there are good days and bad.  I was prescribed \"all purpose nipple ointment\" which should help with the pain and any potential yeast. Icing also helps!  Hopefully your insurance covers lactation consultant visits! The Lactation Network will process your insurance and send someone directly to your house (e.g., my insurance covers 5 free visits) if you're having any trouble or simply want to talk to someone. They were GREAT.     Pet Experience:  We have multiple large dogs with some anxiety and multiple cats (including one that pees when angry), so we were VERY curious how everyone would react. The biggest, older dog was extremely excited from day 1, so we often have to encourage him to back off and not lick the baby's entire face. The younger dog was a bit scared or confused and initially left the room whenever the baby was in it, but she recovered quickly and is now equally interested in the baby. The cats all responded well, and the oldest cat likes to find a nice spot to watch the baby which is very cute. We didn't prep significantly, but we talked a lot about how to manage each of them -- for example, we knew how we wanted to bring the baby inside for the first time and how we wanted to introduce the dogs. We also made the baby items and nursery available to them to investigate and get familiar with it.   Recommendations!   #1 -  Expecting Better  by Emily Oster = book by an economist that breaks down the latest research for data-driven interpretations of \"conventional\" pregnancy advice (spoiler, they're all  bullshit  and caffeine, alcohol, and sushi are not inherently dangerous). She also lays the facts out for you to make your own decisions without judgement -- feel free to skip the caffeine, alcohol, and sushi if YOU wan to. She also has a newsletter and podcast and two more books -- she's fantastic!  I would also lightly recommend  Real Food for Pregnancy  by Lily Nichols. She's a nutritionist, and I thought there was a LOT of valuable information, but it felt much more condescending. I wouldn't read it while you have morning sickness and/or unless you're pretty comfortable with your relationship with food, or you will constantly feel like your baby is starved for nutrients.    #2 - 4moms Mamaroo swing -- Our baby LOVES this swing. He always prefers being in motion and goes to sleep easier when he's walked around in someone's arms, in the stroller, or driving in the car. This swing saved my partner's arms while he did the majority of the heavy lifting!  #3 - Owala water bottle -- sip or straw! Recommended to me by a nurse friend and this thing hasn't left my side since before I was pregnant. I am chronically dehydrated, but drinking through a straw is much easier and I basically try to get through at least three of these (24 oz) per day.  Lovevery Play Gym -- This has been great for tummy time and early contrast cards, plus they provide a booklet of development milestones that you can work on with this gym  A+D ointment + silicon butt spatula -- If anyone in your household has tattoos you may be familiar, because this is the best ointment for both tattoo recovery and diaper rash. Also Honest diaper spray has been great for easy hands-off application -- seems to be out of stock most places though...  NoseFrida Snot Sucker -- Unfortunately our baby is super congested, so this thing has been a lifesaver (don't forget to get the saline spray as well!)  Davinci Chairs --  pricey , but they've been super comfortable and great for tall people (my sister and I got different ones and love them)  Pumpin Pals silicone flanges -- recommendation from a lactation consultant, MUCH better than the hard plastic flanges the pump came with  Aeroflow -- mixed review... BUT they do all the legwork of determining what breast pump and supplies your insurance will pay for, and they'll remind you to get free replacement parts. The pump was 100% free, but they told me compression socks, belly band, etc. would also be free, and then I got a bill after they processed the insurance, so I was a bit annoyed...  I got the Medela Pump in Style, but both consultants were unimpressed. It might be worth asking a consultant or querying this group for recommendations!    Dock-a-tot  Big changing mat -- our baby loves being on the diaper-change mat and my sister's did too!  Magnetic Me onesies -- SO easy to put on and take off, super soft and stretchy! They're very light and thin, but at night you can always pair with...  Kyte Baby sleep sacks -- soft, thick sleep sacks (w/o the swaddle) that just zip around them. Our baby has loved these because they seem to love having their hands free     Good luck to everyone! The light at the end is full of tiny smiles that make it totally worth it :)",

The best way I can describe it is like when you stretch out your legs or leg and they do that quick shake or jerk for a few seconds that what I feel in my tummy.   It doesn't happen a lot, today is the most it's happened though. This morning I was just sitting at my desk and he's in breech position so it was in the top part of my belly and I assumed he did it with his arm and then just now he did it with his leg lower part of my belly and I felt it. And it happens so quickly then he just goes back to regular kicks.  I tried looking it up but it doesn't seem like seizures or anything of the sort cause it doesn't last like that.  And I don't know what would be distressing him to shake like that when I'm just laying down or sitting.   Should I go to the hospital to try and get answers?  Or wait till my doctors is open again?

Then they began attempting to move the baby. They tried two times. It was not comfortable but also did not work. Both times I really had to focus on relaxing and breathing deeply. The most painful part was following the procedure but basically I had cramps and lower back discomfort.   I have opted to go ahead and get a C-section next week.

Did the one hour again but results were a tad high again so now I have to do the three hour one again.   I guess what I want to ask is, has anyone ever taken the glucose exam this many times and is it safe? I‚Äôm just worried. This is my first child and I would do anything to protect him.

    "self_text": "CW/TW: drug abuse, Violence, mention of suicide, etc. - My brother is an addict. He steals, he fights, addict through and through. I am 26w pregnant, and I really haven‚Äôt spoken to him much since the end of my first trimester. He acted like an absolute fool when I was out of town, blowing up my phone and my husband‚Äôs phone - threatening my husband, just being an absolute jerk to me - that was when I was like 13w. He messaged me again last night doing the same crap. Dredging up stuff from the past (all the way from when he was like 10 and I was 15, stuff he really knows nothing about but thinks he is the expert - for example, I got into a fight with a girl in high school and she retaliated by telling the truancy officer I threatened suicide and so I had to go to a mental health clinic for an evaluation, pretty standard stuff. Anyway, I was evaluated, determined I was not a risk, and sent home - all within a few hours. It really wasn‚Äôt a big deal in the grand scheme of things.) He was blaming my parents for that - saying that the reason my parents sent me to the psyche ward was because I‚Äôm gay‚Ä¶ which, btw, I am straight‚Ä¶ so, yeah, idk. Drugs are bad. That‚Äôs just one of the many things he throws into my face. He brings up the fact that I‚Äôve been assaulted, and abused, by people in my past, and uses it to be hurtful. Like, thanks; I‚Äôve already been traumatized but this stuff but sure let‚Äôs just make me feel a little worse about it, why not. He then goes on about things I NEED to do for HIS niece (referencing the baby I‚Äôm carrying, as it‚Äôs my first), and bashing my husband, just trying to be like controlling of my life and my decisions - mind you; I‚Äôm 34 now, he‚Äôs 29. I told him he needs to let things go (talking about the stuff that involved me, and truly doesn‚Äôt involve him at all) and that he needs to get on board with the fact that I am not going to expose my daughter to this drama, so; get your shit together or don‚Äôt expect a relationship with me. I blocked him on social medias a while ago, but this was by text message. Part of me feels like if he has that way to communicate, then I don‚Äôt have to worry he‚Äôll just show up to my house unannounced. That‚Äôs probably a little ptsd from someone I know who had done that to me before. My brother has also been without a drivers license for a few years and just got it back. He was also given a vehicle to get himself back in his feet so he could work. So, that fear is just amped up, regardless if it‚Äôs rational or not. And, aside from my parents, I was the only family that still stayed in touch with him regularly until all this crap. He gets whacked out of his mind and now that I‚Äôm pregnant, uses that as part of his attack, and that‚Äôs honestly the line, so, I gave up. He disrespects both of our sisters, and our brother, (as well as our sister-in-law so my brother is like extra ‚Äúover it‚Äù with him.) He still does this stuff to my parents, in fact like he was a jerk to my dad all day yesterday, then when he did shrooms (and whatever else last night) he called my dad being somber and apologetic but then was being total opposite to me in the same breath. And I mean, unnecessarily mean. Telling me if I don‚Äôt do what he says, he‚Äôs going to ‚Äúdo something about it‚Äù‚Ä¶ and bringing up my maiden name, says that stands for something and I better not forget that. Like wtf? Telling me if I don‚Äôt ‚Äúfix it‚Äù then he‚Äôs gonna fix it. Fix what?! Then going on about how I‚Äôm such a wonderful person and I shouldn‚Äôt kill my self - yeah, don‚Äôt worry, not gonna do that‚Ä¶ never threatened to‚Ä¶. Never wanted to‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs just too much. It‚Äôs like thirty seconds apart - mean, nice, mean, nice (‚Äúnice‚Äù, is a relative term here) I know there‚Äôs not much anyone can do if he‚Äôs not willing to get help for himself. I just needed somewhere to vent. I wish being pregnant wasn‚Äôt already such an emotional experience because it makes dealing with this kind of crap even harder. And with the holidays coming up, like, if he‚Äôs going to be there, I just would rather not. And I hate that. I hate that he can‚Äôt be trusted to just be civil and sober for a few hours. He‚Äôll either be trying to fight with someone, or he‚Äôll be passed out on a couch. There‚Äôs just no in-between with him.",

I‚Äôm 6 weeks 3 days and had my first ultrasound today. All is well so far and the little peanut is right where they should be for growth. But I‚Äôve spent all day hyperventilating, crying, and mentally preparing for the worst. I fully expected to walk into that appointment and hear the words ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no heartbeat‚Äù again. I‚Äôve spent every day since I saw those pink lines in a state of anxiety and fear. It‚Äôs just not fair. I remember the uninhibited joy and happiness of my very first pregnancy. The pure bliss and excitement I felt 24/7. Loss was something that happens to other people. I was beautifully and naively excited, right up until it was ripped away in my second trimester. I want to feel that happiness again, more than anything. I want to announce our baby to family and the world without fear of having to take it back. I want to plan a gender reveal, shop for baby clothes, build a registry without worrying that it will be for nothing. I‚Äôm so fucking jealous of the women who get to experience pregnancy without trauma. It‚Äôs not fair. I just want to enjoy being pregnant, celebrate this baby for all it‚Äôs worth. And I try, I really do. But loss after loss has taught me I can‚Äôt let my heart get into it when I‚Äôm constantly bracing for another. I thought today would calm my fears but it hasn‚Äôt one bit. I‚Äôm irrationally angry and jealous of the women who get to be pregnant without the burden of loss looming over every minute of what should be a happy experience. The joy of expecting is gone for me and it‚Äôs just. not. fair.",

I like the idea of having a little time with just us three (this is our first child), as well as having some privacy to deal with whatever may come after delivering. Once we are home, obviously friends family, etc will want to see the baby, and I‚Äôm okay with that.  I do however, think that I will want to see my mom, even just briefly. I have a great relationship with her, I‚Äôm the first daughter to have a baby in the family, and sometimes, you just need your mama! I have a great relationship with my MIL as well, but it‚Äôs just different than your own mom. Would I be out of line to ask that only my mom visits after the delivery? Does that feel cringey? I know that I ultimately get to make the call, as it‚Äôs my medical procedure, but I also don‚Äôt want to rock the boat or hurt anyone‚Äôs feelings. Thoughts?",

My obs office is an hour away and the hospital 5 minutes from our house doesnt have l&d so we have to drive an hour to get to the hospital as well. I'm going to the same office for this pregnancy as I did with my first but different doctor because my old ob moved out of the US. My last pregnancy at 32 weeks they started me doing every other week 2 appointments (I had GD last time too) but they induced me at 38 weeks. This time around my GD is worse because other medical issues. But they won't induce me? But they are making me do 2 appointments a week driving a 2 hour round trip? How is it that serious that I need seen twice a week but not to induce early I don't get it. My option right now is to be selectively Induced at 39 weeks. The only issue is with my first I was already 5cm when I got induced. And with the fear that I have to drive an hour to get to the hospital. I really don't wanna have my baby in the car. I have brought the induction up to my ob because at the beginning of my pregnancy we talked about 37 or 38 week induction but has now changed their tune to no induction. And if I bring it up they steam roll the conversation and basically say no this is how ots going to happen. I'm gonna have my husband help me bring it up next appointment to try and get induced at 38 or even 39 if have too but he is more assertive when I comes to doctors  so I'm hoping it will go well. Thank you if you read all this and if you have an advice on how to get them to listen to my concerns I'm all ears",

My husband and I said no way and said we didn't even want visitors until after leaving the hospital. My mom cannot seem to wrap her head around this. I tried explaining I'll probably be exhausted and my husband and I just want to spend the hours after birth bonding with our baby. Her response was that I don't understand how important a birth us for a grandparent and I wouldn't have to do anything during the hospital visit besides smile and look happy.   Now everytime she talks to my husband's side of the family, she tells them how mean I am for not letting her into the hospital and says I must hate her.

I'm also open and would like to hear about other moms experiences so maybe I dont feel so alone lol  So, I'm perfectly healthy the only thing thats ever come up was on my last blood draw my iron was a little low and they put me on supplements, and my white blood cells were a little high but they're not concerned. I've been having braxton contractions for a couple weeks and they're getting more frequent and a little stronger (nothing super bad though, just mild and uncomfortable)  About 3 days ago though I woke up and it was something completely different, it had a pattern to it and didnt feel like the braxton contractions Id been having up until that point. It started with a stronger crampy feeling that started at the top of my uterus then moved downwards, and would dissipate into nothing. Then a few minutes later I'd get a dull ache in the side of my belly and my back would start hurting. I also had some pressure in my vagina on what felt like my cervix that would get more intense with the cramping. I started timing them and they never got any closer than 20 minutes in an hour so I just went back to bed. (They also eventually stopped for the night because they kept me up for an hour after I tried to go back to bed)  I've had the same type of cramping multiple times everyday since then and now I'm noticing other symptoms as well, I started having really bad anxiety attacks yesterday and have been having them since. I also lost my appetite almost completely and instead of eating I'm just constantly thirsty. I wake up at 3 in the morning every morning for about 4 days now despite being absolutey exhausted and cannot go back to sleep to save my life, and I have just a constant feeling of needing to go to the bathroom even though theres nothing in there. (No burning or anything like that, it just feels like my baby is laying right on top of my bladder. Which to be fair she probably is lol)  I'm really nervous, scared and excited all at the same time (so is everyone else lol) but we live a little ways away from the hospital so I think thats getting to me a little bit, I also really dislike hospitals because everytime I've been to one I had a really bad experience for one reason or another. So I really dont want to show up on a false alarm or anything like that because I'll freak out the entire time and I don't need that right now.

She was so happy that she was going to be a grandma, she was going to have a grandchild, her son was having a baby, and \"omg I'm finally a grandmother\" etc. I don't mean to take the happiness away from her but her actions at the time spoke to me like I was just the carrier of the baby. She's usually a lovely and caring lady, but this day, she asked no questions about my wellbeing (first baby, absolutely awful morning sickness, and had worries without any of my family members here due to living overseas) and she continued to tell all her family members (with our approval) and talking as if I wasn't there and how much of a great father my husband is going to be.

    "self_text": "Asking for a friend. At a standard private hospital. OB said that cervix check was REQUIRED prior upon admittance to hospital to see if you should stay or go home, and required prior to them encouraging you to push to make sure things are 10cm dilated. Said no exceptions, except upon entry if the baby is already popping out. Cited a story about the last person who died while giving birth because the cervix ruptured. Felt that that scare tactic was highly unnecessary, but it was already said. Any suggestions on how one can go about this? Assume it is too late to switch providers at this point. Should one just go to the hospital when contractions are every few minutes apart consistently? Don't want this to be a dramatic or tense experience either, but trying to balance that with the desire not to get a cervix check at all during labor. Thanks in advance.",

I decided to have it because I‚Äôve been SO anxious about the health of my baby that I thought the gender would be one thing that could be just pure fun because we truly don‚Äôt care. We just want a healthy baby.  Well my anxiety hasn‚Äôt gotten ANY better. I thought I‚Äôd be reassured at my dating scan when we found the heartbeat. I got a private scan at 10 weeks that found increased NT. NT scan with doctor at 12 weeks showed that it resolved. I thought I would feel better then. NIPT came in, low risk. I thought I would feel better then. AFP and heartbeat check at 15 weeks, all normal. I thought I would feel better then. Private scan at 16 weeks. Everything looked PERFECT. I thought I would feel better.   Now my anatomy scan is just 2 weeks away and I can‚Äôt sleep I‚Äôm so consumed with worry. I don‚Äôt even want to know the gender anymore because I don‚Äôt want to bond with the baby in case they find something at the anatomy scan.  Everyone is telling me I need to speak positively to my baby and have hope, and in part they are right because there is NO evidence that there is something wrong. I SHOULD be able to bond with this baby. I had a hard time getting pregnant so I don‚Äôt understand my resistance to accepting this joy into my life. I understand that it does take time, but if everything is fine what is wrong with me? I‚Äôm having serious mom guilt, and I know I probably need to start back on my SSRI but I‚Äôm not open to that until after the anatomy scan if everything has developed normally so far.  I‚Äôm in weekly therapy with a prenatal therapist, I exercise, eat well, meditate, pray, etc. am I hurting my baby by not being able to relax and enjoy this? If you can relate, when did you start to feel safe and happy? Was it when you found out the gender? When you started feeling kicks? Anatomy scan? Birth? Years after birth?

    "self_text": "Hi guys, I‚Äôm writing this overwhelmed with joy while my little one is sleeping on my chest. Ive always loved this sub, as it provided me with lots of useful info about pregnancy, and it also helped me a lot during labour. I was absolutely terrified of going into labour and childbirth, but honestly it couldn‚Äôt have gone any better. Here‚Äôs my story (it‚Äôs pretty long)   On Thursday 24/11 I was sitting on my couch, watching tv when I suddenly felt a gush water coming out of me. A bit confused, and also scared (I did NOT want it to be blood) I went to the toilet. There I noticed my underwear was soaking (like I fully peed myself) and even my sweatpants were wet, with what looked just like water. I told my bf I was pretty sure my waters broke, we called the hospital to ask for advice (as I was not having any contractions) and they asked us to come in, to be sure there weren‚Äôt any complications.  Arriving there (around 8 in the evening) they put me on a monitor to be sure baby was doing okay. They told me I had to stay there until I had delivered my baby because they only tested me for GBS that morning and did not know if I had it. So for safety reasons I had to stay there. From the monitor room they brought me into a delivery room and I had to stay there until I gave birth. That‚Äôs when it got to me, I was gonna meet my baby soon.   After a while in the delivery room the gynaecologist came to check on me. I still wasn‚Äôt having any contractions, she told me that if they weren‚Äôt starting soon they would prob give me a tablet to start them (and later oxytocine) because I has to deliver within 24h (or a certain amount of time) of having my waters break. And it would be better to start the delivery fit and awake, then after being in the hospital for 12h already and being too tired to push. I told her I rather waited a bit, and to start the induction after a couple more hours (if I still wasn‚Äôt having any contractions). She agreed, but first did a cervix check to naturally  induce me (it sometimes starts labour) And low and behold, about 20 min later my contractions started.   Around 12h at night the contractions started to become a bit more powerful, so I asked to use the bath so I could endure them better (the delivery room had a bed, a bed for my boyfriend and a very nice, big bath). Note: when the midwife had last checked me I was only 1 cm dilated and my cervix was still shortening. I went into the bath and quickly the contractions became unbearable to me. I remember thinking ‚ÄòI‚Äôm barely dilated and I can‚Äôt handle it anymore, how am I gonna survive this‚Äô. I asked for an epidural (after being in the bath for 2h) and heard that I was already 4cm dilated. The midwife called the anesthesist and told me I was prob delivering soon. The epidural did not hurt at all, after those contractions, and was honestly a gods gift. I was able to sleep for a bit after having it.   While laying on the bed we noticed the baby‚Äôs heartbeat dropped every time I had a contraction. Which made them suspect the umbilical cord was wrapped around his head or neck. This TERRIFIED me. They instructed me to only lay on my side, as this seemed to be the best position for the baby. I tried not to think about it and hoped for the best.   Another 5,5hours later (dilation didn‚Äôt go as smooth as expected) I started feeling contractions again, quite painful. So I asked for another dose of painmeds in my back. They gave it to me, and only later I realised it were the contractions right before pushing. Because the epidural didn‚Äôt seem to be working anymore they asked me to sit straight, I did, and as by wonder, the babies heartbeat stopped dropping during contractions. About 1,5h later (around 8.45 Friday morning). I was finally 10cm dilated and could start pushing. Cause of the higher dose of epidural I did not feel a thing in my legs (but I still felt the contractions) and I could push pretty good. After 3 contractions and 15 min there he was, my perfect little baby. I did not tear, only had some small scrapes and 2h after giving birth I was up and walking again. I feel a 100x better then during pregnancy, and the pushing part terrified me the most but it was the most easy part for me.   I‚Äôm from Western Europe btw. If anyone has any questions, feel free!",

    "self_text": "I found out about 2 weeks ago. It was very much planned and my husband and i have planned our whole future around having a child or two. I'm an expat living in Japan, from the US. Japan is a much easier place to raise a child (at least while they're young) so we decided to stay here for the next ~10 years and while I don't hate it, I don't vibe with the culture and the people as much as I'd like and it can be incredibly isolating for a forgeinger living here and I only have 1 friend and she's moving soon. We can't afford to move back to the US right now though between the exchange rate and inflation.  So now this pregnancy went from a super fun hypothetical \"when we have kids, let's make the nursery Totoro themed!\" Type discussions to, we are HAVING a kid and I just... Am not excited for it. Got a 6 week ultrasound to confirm and felt nothing. I told 2 friends and they were ecstatic for me and I'm just kinda like... Oh yeah, yep I'm so happy! But really I'm dreading the sleepless nights and the loss of my identity.  On top of that, this pregnancy comes on the heels of a devastating fallout with my mother that has completely undermined my trust in her and my desire to have a relationship with her at all. (she seems unaware of this as she continues to message me and pretend like nothing is wrong) I just look at all she sacrificed in order to raise my brother and I and now neither of us have good relationships with her and she has never missed an opportunity to remind me of how devastatingly painful that is for HER and I just hate thinking that my life could turn out like that.  I've also been struggling with depression recently (see first paragraph lol) but haven't been able to see a therapist yet and I'm pretty certain a pregnancy and newborn is not going to help those issues. I just had a long and tearful discussion about this with my husband and he asked me if I wanted to terminate and try again some other time when I was ready. But I did feel ready before. I was tracking my cycles and we did this on purpose and now I just ...don't feel happy about it. My husband also 100% wants this but he promised me that he would never prioritize a pregnancy over me or my mental health and I believe him. While this isn't really helpful in deciding the right course it's so nice to know I married someone who is 100% in my corner and loves me unconditionally.   I'm sorry this was a lot. I'm not really sure what I'm expecting but I would love to hear from someone who maybe felt like this initially and did not turn out to hate or majorly regret their decision to become a parent.

    "self_text": "I'm a few months along now, I didn't find out in time to have it fixed, and I am now forced to carry this baby to term. I had nightmares about becoming pregnant, and when I found out I had probably the worst month of my life. Constant anxiety attacks, nonstop crying, the walls always closing in on me, no escape.  I know we are not financially well off enough for another kid, but not only that, I don't want another kid. I don't think I have the mental capacity to raise another baby.  I felt like I have been going crazy the past 4 years, trying my best to be a stay at home parent. But I hate it. I hate never going anywhere and never being able to have an escape, I'm always on all the time, there is never any real down time. My son is finally almost ready to go to school and I was so ready to be able to start working again, to feel like I have a life outside of just \"mom\".   It feels like I'm being forced to start all over and I hate it, everytime I feel this baby move it makes me anxious, every nudge is a reminder of my fear. My partner and I had both agreed we didn't want another baby, that we had missed the \"deadline\". I knew if we were going to have another I didn't want the age gap to be this big. But now that I'm pregnant, my partner suddenly wants to keep the baby, says it might be good for our son to have a sibling, that we can just \"figure out\" the finances. I have done the math there is no \"figuring it out\".   I have tried to have conversations with my partner about how this entire pregnancy has been a nightmare I can't wake up from, how I feel trapped. How I feel like nothing more than a vessel, like no one cares that I'm me anymore, they only care about this thing growing inside of me. My partner says that it's not true, and that people do care, but that doesn't fix how I feel about it.  I feel so very stuck, I want to put this baby up for adoption, I think it's what is best long term for my family as a whole. I have tried to have this conversation with my partner several times, and nothing seems to have changed, I don't know what to do. He gives me very little reason for why he wants to keep this baby, just \"now that it's here I feel attached\". I'm not sure what to do. I feel gross for not feeling the way I'm \"supposed\" to. And I feel trapped. If anyone has advice, any reassurance that I'm not a monster, I'd really appreciate it.  Edit: I think I'm done with this post for now, some people are being a little rude, and while it's fine to think I'm stupid I don't think I'm in the headspace to deal with the comments.  I agree with you I think I'm stupid. I think all of this was stupid, I wish I could've done things differently l, but I didn't. This is where I am now. Can't change what's been done.  As for abortion, I don't think that's going to happen this late stage. I appreciate the comments giving me suggestions, but I don't think that's going to be the right choice for me.  I plan on discussing everything with my partner more, and reaching out for some mental health help, as well as getting my Medicaid situation figured out.  I can't thank everyone enough for their reassurance and their comments. I really needed people to talk to today, so thank you.  That's it from me for now. Have a good one.",

I‚Äôve never had ANY bleeding at all, not now or ever in my pregnancy (I‚Äôm now 15weeks exactly.) I‚Äôve looked at other posts about SCH and typically see posts regarding bleeding but I can‚Äôt find anything about cramping/stomach aches and no bleeding at all. It was a small SCH so my doctor put me on pelvic rest until my next visit on 12/2. I called and questioned the stomach pain and the student who answered didn‚Äôt really answer my questions that well besides saying ‚Äòsome pain is expected‚Äô but wouldn‚Äôt answer if a constant prolonged pain is normal for a SCH.

I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced or is experiencing this and what has helped you.  A few people I've talked to have recommended a banana for the potassium (but I hate bananas) and when I read about it online it doesn't actually seem like my cramps are being caused by a lack of potassium.  Every article I've read about this seems to recommend more water (I don't think this is my issue though), more calcium, and more magnesium.  I'm not opposed to trying to get more potassium, but I feel like if that's not my issues then it's like taking tylenol for morning sickness.  Like I said just trying to find out what seemed to work for others to get them to stop.  They seem to cramp in the middle of the night but they are sore throughout the day ever since this started happening.",

But once we started trying for baby I knew I wanted to switch. I remember my sister had WONDERFUL experiences through both of her pregnancies and would gush about how much she liked her doctor, so I decided to make the switch.  Had my pregnancy confirmation with her today and it was AMAZING. From the moment she walked in the room I just got such great vibes from her whole demeanor and the way she spoke to my husband and I. She was really easy to understand and thorough. Didn't feel like we were rushed or anything, totally had time to ask all of our questions and make sure we were feeling good.   She even did the ultrasound herself instead of bringing a tech in to do it! Got to see our little blob, who is measuring right on track. Saw the heartbeat, and even saw the little thing wiggle on screen, though my husband missed the movement. The OB assured me that everything she saw today is exactly what they want to see and that at this point my risk of miscarriage is very low which is SUCH A RELIEF (though i'm sure i'll worry haha).  Was such a great moment to share with my husband. None of this was really feeling very real to him yet. So far just seemed like I was more complainy than normal i guess, haha. But its sinking in more now that he saw our little friend on screen. He really liked our doctor too.  I just couldn't feel better about how this is all going.

We bought a couple of apple cider jugs to take home with us as well and it wasn't until we got home that I realized their apple cider isn't pasteurized. The first hot apple cider I drank today was really hot, so I'm not as concerned about that one, but the second one was more warmed though I don't think it'd been in the warmer too long before I got it.  I don't plan on drinking any of the apple cider we brought home now that I know. I'm just a little worried about any bacteria that could potentially harm the baby.   Did anyone else deal with something similar while pregnant?",

So you have boob, which is firm and full and then the nipple sits over the top and is soft and is able to expand and retract due to temperature/sensitivity, right?  In the last few weeks after having been asleep, my nipples feel like they are swollen and hard - just the nipples, my boobs feel completely normal. After and hour or so of being up and doing things, they go back to normal. I know boobs go through a lot of changes - size, sensitivity etc. But I've never heard of the nipples themselves being \"swollen\". They don't hurt or anything and I'm not concerned, I'm just curious if anyone knows what's up?",

Last week I had some weird feelings of leaking and I informed my midwife on Tuesday since we had a planned appointment. She performed a nitrazine test to see if it was amniotic fluid. The result was flashingly positive. She embraced me and told me she was so sorry but that I needed to go to the hospital to plan for a pregnancy interruption. I can‚Äôt describe how devastated I have been.   I went to the hospital and they were much less alarming. They performed a more specific test (PROM test for amniotic fluid antibodies) and it was inconclusive. They looked at the baby, the baby was fine and I had normal levels of amniotic fluid. They told me to get back in a week. I have been on full bed rest since.   I went back yesterday, normal level of amniotic fluid, baby is fine, PROM test came back negative. We will check again next week.   I thought it would be a relief but I fill so anxious. I‚Äôm terrified that I‚Äôm still leaking and that the PROM test is a false negative. I have no explanation for the nitrazine test, none of the usual suspects for nitrazine false positives apply. I don‚Äôt know how to get back to normal or if I even should. I‚Äôm so afraid of losing my baby. Any help appreciated!",

    "self_text": "Ok so- last month OB says I need to get an anatomy scan, that is must be between 19-22 weeks gestation. The referral he gave me, I called and talked to someone but they never called me back to make an appointment after saying someone would. So I scrambled and called anywhere in my area asking if they did those scans. I found ONE place in my area that had availability and I specifically asked if they did anatomy scans where they check all organs and limbs and measure everything. They said ‚Äúyes‚Äù and it will cost me $215.  So off I went and paid the $$, sat for an hour while the tech took about 100 ultrasound photos.  I go to my next OB appt and he says that was NOT an anatomy scan but they can schedule me with the referred doc in two weeks. I told him I was REALLY ticked I got charged for a service I did not receive and that I was mislead- but also that this is adding up to insane amounts of money (taking days off for these appointments + Gas because doc is 1 he away+ doc bills) I am the only one in my house making money.  I looked up on the site American College of Obs and Gyns and they say only ONE ultrasound mid pregnancy is even necessary.  So why am I taking off all these days off work, driving 2.5 hrs to and from doc for these unnecessary appointments!!?  Also why was it so important for the anatomy scan to happen at 20 weeks but now all of a sudden it‚Äôs ok to get it at 27 weeks? I feel like I‚Äôm getting bullshitted at every turn.  I‚Äôm a FTM and I‚Äôm just concerned that if I decided to skip this OTHER anatomy scan what if something is wrong with my baby? And even if there was what would they even do about it? I‚Äôm only 25 weeks preggo and I‚Äôve spent way more than $2,000 in doctor trips and fees and all of this seems really excessive to me for not having a high risk pregnancy. That‚Äôs money I could be spending buying stuff my baby will need once she‚Äôs born‚Ä¶ Am i bad mom for thinking all these appointments are BS? I keep hearing from women in other states and countries that they have 3-4 ultrasounds whole pregnancy and their babies are FINE.  EDIT/UPDATE:  Thank you ladies for sharing your thoughts and just being here for me to rant to. I‚Äôve decided to definitely get the anatomy scan because my baby‚Äôs health is and always will be my top priority.",

This is obviously my first year hosting pregnant and I debated for a while doing it but decided to, just with a smaller group. It was scheduled for Saturday, and on Wednesday I got a text from friend 1 saying she‚Äôd had a positive PCR test, but her 5 day quarantine would be over by Saturday and PCRs ‚Äúcan pick up infections from the past 3 months‚Äù I said normally I‚Äôd be ok but given I‚Äôm pregnant I‚Äôm going to be extra cautious and ask if she can do a rapid on the day.

I text friend 2 saying can she also test before coming and she said she had no at home tests left and wouldn‚Äôt have a chance to get to a PCR. I left it there. In between this time, I was texting back and forth with friend 1 and they‚Äôd mentioned they had a sore throat on Monday and tired but generally felt ok.   On Saturday morning, I get a text from friend 1 that her rapid was negative and could she still come. I said no because a) she‚Äôd admitted she was experiencing symptoms 4 days before so could still be contagious and b) friend 2 couldn‚Äôt test so I then felt unfair saying one could come and one couldn‚Äôt?   I didn‚Äôt make my other guests test, no. But for me - to knowingly allow them in when they could be exposed/contagious just felt too risky for me and also unfair for others attending.

    "self_text": "Warning: Long post!   OB ordered a detailed scan to check on baby‚Äôs weight at our 39w regular (16 Nov). Since baby was pushing 3.5kg/8lb, & I was 2cm dilated, OB was concerned about having labour difficulties with a big baby (I‚Äôm average-sized). Also with GBS+, I had to be sufficiently medicated before baby arrives. I was admitted to L&D that evening after a final lunch date (thanks mom, bless you) with my husband who was too anxious to eat üòÇ  Before induction, the medical team insisted I eat first so we had a small dinner in the delivery suite while I was getting my IV. Once we‚Äôd finished eating, the penicillin was hooked up & cervical check + membrane sweep confirmed that I was (still) 2cm dilated. I had contractions on & off, I told the nurses it was ‚Äúperiod cramps on steroids‚Äù.  Contractions became progressively more unpleasant & I was very much in pain when it was time to break my waters due to the overall discomfort. As they were about to start with the pitocin for the induction, I tapped out & signed the consent for the epidural after 10 hours of labour after discussing it with husband. Though I initially wanted to do unmedicated labour, I felt like I‚Äôd rather skip the intensity of pitocin & get some rest instead.  The next 8 hours was just falling in & out of sleep, random conversations, cervical checks & doctors/nurses walking in & out. As baby was not taking well to the pitocin, they stopped it as soon as they started when they saw her heart rate drop. Contractions were regular but spaced quite some time apart, though dilation was going great - I was already at 10cm by noon on the 17th. As baby‚Äôs heart rate wasn‚Äôt picking up, I was given a muscle relaxant to pause contractions so baby could recover. Once her heart rate was up, they decided on a half dose of pitocin to get things going again, then it was time to push.  Pushing wasn‚Äôt so much about the pain but the pressure bearing down was INTENSE. It felt like I was taking the biggest shit of my life. By the time I started pushing the epidural had started wearing off - too late to ask for more so I decided to just grit my teeth & get on with it. 2.5 hours of pushing, 4 rounds of puking, baby having a loop of umbilical cord around her neck, 8 medical staff in the room, & an emergency episiotomy later - my daughter was born at 39w3d, on 17 Nov 2022, a chonky 3.5kg / 7lb 11oz. Baby girl latched immediately during skin to skin, husband & I just felt the whole world get a little bigger with our daughter finally in our arms. We even joked about how the experience was a 10/10, would do again kinda thing üòÇ  Labour took 20 hours in total & I had amazing medical staff who always put my needs first, asking if I was okay, encouraging me to go all the way & making decisions that were ultimately beneficial for baby‚Äôs safety, i.e. episiotomy. Husband was also really being present & supportive the whole time even though he‚Äôs squeamish about blood & watching the baby come out, though he was really excited to cut the cord. I truly couldn‚Äôt ask for a better experience!  Husband has been great as a dad so far & the last 1 week has allowed us to navigate being parents & a new family; I can‚Äôt even begin to describe how full my heart has been ‚ù§Ô∏è A huge thank you to this subreddit, that has seen me through many a pregnancy-related question/uncertainty. It‚Äôs bittersweet, but it‚Äôs not goodbye! Here‚Äôs wishing everyone uneventful pregnancies & safe deliveries. Till next time! ‚ò∫Ô∏è",

Im waiting for Monday to come so we can take the appointment with her OBGYN.   Right now we are struggling with her nausea. She is extremely sensitive to smell. We just came to a restaurant for lunch and as soon as we sat down , the smell bothered her so much she felt like puking. Once we got outside to the car with fresh air she felt alot better.   She has been drinking water and staying hydrated. I was not sure what we can do to help with this nausea that happens with smell.   Anyone else have issue with smell that lead to nausea? Im worried we wont get a doc appt right away it may be a few days with thanksgiving holiday coming.   Any suggestions for us is appreciated!",

Historically hospital credentialing has taken 2-3 months before being able to start work. I‚Äôm also not sure how to navigate showing up to an interview at the end of pregnancy.

We had two scans over the last week and both times they went very well - strong heartbeat, great measurements and everything!  Doctor couldn't be more pleased.  We have not shared the news with anyone else except for a few very close friends that were supportive during out previous losses so this was a big, scary step for the both of us.  My wife decided that she was going to tell them when we sat down to the table and shared what we are thankful for.  When we told her parents it was very sweet and many of happy tears were shed.  It went very well.  However, my MIL didn't wait but five minutes to start making it about her and taking the joy out of the room.  My wife's mother started talking about her struggles with getting pregnant, her cousin's multiple losses, how you can lose a baby at any time during the pregnancy and how we need to decide now what to do if my wife's health is in danger.  She went on and on about all the different ways a pregnancy can go wrong (which we know, we have experience RPL for the last 2 years) and even commented that \"she was surprised about us sharing the news since there is such a high chance of us losing it again\"  like wt actual f?  We shared that the doctor was happy and the appointments, numbers and ultrasounds have been great so far, to which she replied with a story of another loss from someone she knew.  We showed her the ultrasound picture and she commented \"yeah at this stage it could end at any moment, they just don't know looking at this\".   We asked if she wanted a copy of one and she said, I shit you not \"no, i'll wait to see if you go full term.\"  At one point, she even asked my wife if she was going to get a new doctor because \"you probably want a male doctor\" and even implied it was my wife's current doctor's fault for our previous losses.  It was relentless and inappropriate.   Because this is a pregnancy sub I am actually censoring all that she talked about because it was really that inappropriate.  It made me extremely upset.  I tried to step in a bit but my wife text me under the table saying \"just ignore it\" so I kept my mouth shut and just left the room.  Just needing to vent so if this is inappropriate please remove but I just need to get this out.  I mean, we knew that it was going to frustrating but I didn't know that it was going to go like that when we told my MIL.  I just don't understand what makes people like that!?!?!",

So I found out I was pregnant in July (currently 18 weeks!) and my midwife strongly recommends a flu shot during pregnancy.

Is it bad to have two flu shots in the space of less than a year?

Baby was experiencing decels and not tolerating contractions well, so they decided to induce (with possibility of c-section if he further declined).   Started a 3cm/25% effaced/-3 station at 1pm with pitocin.   At 4pm, they broke my water at 4cm/50% effaced/-3 station.   At 5pm, I started a fentanyl drip with plans to get an epidural once pain increased.   At 7:40pm, I was checked again and at 5cm/90% effaced/-2 station.   Well, 14 contractions later (at 8:20pm) and I suddenly was screaming and writhing in pain. My husband said it was like an exorcism and basically said to get her an epidural now. Baby had a sudden decline in heart rate. My nurse called for a doctor, who was there in seconds. She asked me to lay back after my next contraction and as I laid back I screamed ‚Äúhe‚Äôs coming out‚Äù and she basically looked between my legs and told my nurse to get the team there now. This was at 8:27pm. At 8:40pm, my baby was on my chest!   No epidural, but minimal tearing and tolerating pain well on Tylenol (plus witch hazel pads and dermoplast).   Baby boy weighed 7lbs 13oz. He‚Äôs doing well but because he traveled down the birth canal so fast, he has a ton of amniotic fluid in his belly still, which he has been vomiting up for the past 18 hours. It‚Äôs also made him hard to nurse. Doctors aren‚Äôt concerned and said this normally resolves in 24-48 hours. We are getting discharged in the morning!",

    "self_text": "FTM here, almost at the 37 week mark. I live across the country from my family and it will just be my Husband and myself when baby comes into this world.  Despite me telling my mom that she's not allowed in the birthing room, both by my own personal rules and by the hospitals rules, and telling her that my husband and I would like 2 weeks alone with baby, she has been trying to plan to come a week before my due date.   She has no savings for her plane ticket, and nothing booked, but asked my Dad to borrow money from his parents to book a flight to be here for OVER A MONTH starting in 2 weeks from now.   My dad called me cause he knows I've tried to set the boundary of her visit to only 2 weeks in length and 2 weeks after baby is born. It was agreed that I'd book the flight for what dates make the most sense price wise considering it's around the holidays to try to save some money and for dates that my Husband and I would prefer her to be out here. So I did that, I booked her to come out for 15 days early January, about 3 weeks after due date.   I just called her to tell her and I can't stop crying. I know I just broke her heart again, and I know that I did the right thing, but it sucks that I need to be the rational and reasonable adult here. She stated on the phone \"what I want doesn't matter\". And she's right, it doesn't matter more than what's best for baby and myself and hubby. I can tell she's pissed. She hung up the phone without saying I love you. We are usually pretty close but when it comes to big life events she tries to \"show off\"  and make it about herself.   I tried to provide short simple rationale for the choice, like the price of flying around Christmas, the risk of infections to baby, the need for her help more once my husband goes back to work versus when he's home with me freshly post partum. I could tell she wasn't absorbing any of that and is just mad that I'm shutting her out of this experience.   Idk what I expect from posting here except maybe some solidarity that setting boundaries does suck, and it's hard when you have  people-pleasing tendencies, but it's one of the first hard things you gotta do as a momma. Also just needed to vent cause I can't stop crying.   Any advice on how to prevent more drama going forward is also appreciated.",

His mother feels the need to let me know that I am not giving her the first grandchild, almost rubbing my face in it...  My partner and his ex do not get on - they are civil for their daughters sake.  However his mother seems to think it's acceptable to send me photos and give me information that I don't care for as every pregnancy is different and I am classed as high risk anyways due to complications.   His mother also feels very entitled to know every slight bit of information, even if it isn't appropriate to tell her, or I don't want her to know as it is private.   My question is, is it odd that his mother is so obsessed with letting me know that I'm not giving her the first grandchild and kind of rubbing my face in it. but then on the other hand is very obsessed to know what's going on with me and my baby, and why I'm high risk and wants to know every bit of detail?",

She also said she had no urge to go to the bathroom. After that she started having pressure and some pain.

    "self_text": "To start off with I made a post a few days ago because I thought I was starting labor and this is sort of a continuation/rant I guess.   I'm 38 weeks and have been having cramps, and a bunch of other symptoms so when my OB (who is different from the one I've been seeing this entire pregnancy because unfortunately she won't be able to deliver at the hospital I plan to have my baby at, but this new OB can and my practice has moved me to her because of that. Plus this \"new\" OB is the same one that delivered me almost 22 years ago, small world am I right. But my mom said she was a good doctor and had no complaints) offered to check my cervix I was like \"hell yeah I wanna know if I'm making any progress\"   I'm quite shy and have had trauma in the past that makes it difficult for me to allow others to touch me, so my husband was with me the entire time to help me feel a bit better.(due to that trauma and experiences with medical professionals he never leaves my side and I'm incredibly thankful to him for that ) I've had cervical checks before due to a false alarm but when she went to check me I just immediately tensed up and it hurt like hell. She kept telling me to \"relax the muscle\" and I tried to but my body just wanted to shut down. My husband noticed and held my hand and started whispering that itll be okay to me which helped a little but then all of a sudden she just forced her fingers all the way up there and did the check. Which hurt even worse.  Afterwards she told me I was 1.5 dialated and that I probably want an epidural if I cant even take a cervical exam.   Idk if I'm being overly emotional or what but that comment fucked with me a bit because.. well what if she is right. I feel like I already failed before I've even began and I shouldnt even try to have my baby naturally like I wanted because I couldnt even handle a cervical check.   I ended up crying alone last night because I knew it would piss my husband off and he'd tell me to find a new provider, but I just feel like I'll have the same problem with everyone else too and theres no point in trying. I trusted my previous OB and when she would check me I didnt tense up or freak out or anything and its really upsetting she cant deliver my baby. I wanted to deliver at a birth center (which my previous OB wouldve been able to deliver for) but within the last week they've gotten concerned I might develop preeclampsia so I no longer can.   Idk I feel like I'm being too sensitive maybe but I'm not sure I'm going to feel comfortable with her touching me at all when time comes to deliver.  Update:   Thank you to everyone who commented, I'm both sad and disgusted by the fact that this seems to be so common. I told my husband how I felt about last night and he got pissed just like I thought he was going to,(told me to call the practice and cancel my appointment with her immediately)  unfortunately she's one of the on-call at the hospital and because of the risk and ongoing testing for potential preeclampsia (plus how frickin late in the game I am) I dont feel super comfortable switching either because that gets test results lost and a lot of confusion.   He was a little upset with me I didn't tell him (he knew I was upset but not why) but said that he's not going to let her touch me again and if theres another on-call when I go into labor he's just going to go ahead and request they see me instead of her. And if we do get stuck with her he said he's \"going to be up her ass and watching everything. \" Because he doesnt want her pressuring me or making me feel bad and giving into getting medication or something I don't want. He knows when I'm in pain if you pester me about shit long enough I'll give in just so I'm left alone, or can get overwhelmed and a little insecure  I'm just really lucky to have him with me through all this because if I was alone with all the hormones, stress and bullshit I'd be a absolute mess and probably unable to function. I feel like my practice is throwing me around like a dirty towel between seeing doulas and now fully changing me over to this woman. I've definitely learned a lot (bit too late to change some stuff unfortunately) but if I'm lucky enough to get another go around with pregnancy, not only am I going to avoid this woman like the plague I'm also going to do everything in my power to keep my original OB so I can stay with her and therefore my happy zone.",

    "title": "Best eco-conscious alternative to cloth diapers?",
    "self_text": "Hi all! I welcomed my rainbow baby last week and we've been figuring out life together since. My little dude is just that- little- so we've been using disposable newborn diapers for the past week because cloth diapers would be entirely too bulky on him at this point. We do have a decent sized stash of cloth diapers because my mom is amazing and wanted to get some for us, but now I'm second guessing how much we'll actually use them. We live in the desert and water usage is restricted, plus we have a lot going on in our household already laundry-wise (3 adults, baby, plus a bunch of pets). I'm quietly hopeful that maybe we can use cloth diapers when baby is a little bigger/older/not peeing every 5 seconds, but if we are going to go the disposable route at least for the time being, I would still prefer to go with something more eco-friendly than most of the in-store brands. I've been looking into some options online but am kind of completely overwhelmed and kicking myself that I didn't consider that cloth diapering wouldn't work out for us sooner. Thank you in advance for any recommendations or insight!",

A dozen of them very low which I didn‚Äôt understand at the time I‚Äôve also had some new aches and pains.  We had gone in for an ultrasound to check he had flipped and while we were there they also mentioned that he was ‚Äúvery low‚Äù in my pelvis and I should expect to feel a lot of pressure.  I have found it to be a little intense though. I‚Äôve just noticed some sudden obvious changes since then. I‚Äôve been waking up much earlier with energy and without an alarm.  I‚Äôve been in and out of bed ALL night now to use the bathroom and I‚Äôve been experiencing lightening crotch, swelling and so much pressure along with (tmi) rectal pains and an upset stomach. Along with difficulty walking too far because of the ligament pains and cramps.   I was just wondering .a) does everyone else feel like they‚Äôre struggling a lot more once baby flips/drops .b) how long did you personally experience this before giving birth?",

She gets upset easily if thing doesn‚Äôt go like the way she wants. For example, there was a day that IT tried to fix something on her laptop and all of her notes were gone. Then she got supper angry, my desk was next to her. Then she slammed her desk really hard, and threw anything on her table. It was in the morning, I arrived to office and witnessed that and she complained a lot. I felt so unsafe and anxious when she got upset in something. I know it is not my business, but I sit next to her, I feel so uncomfortable.  She will be out for 1 week on thanksgiving, and I will be covering her for that week. So I want to get all training so she can fully enjoy her vacation and doesn‚Äôt have to worry that she has a ton of work when she‚Äôs back. There is a spreadsheet she created and one column is protected and I can‚Äôt do data entry for that column and she seemed didn‚Äôt  really try to fix. Next day, I Googled and found the way how to remove the protection. I sent her the website, and she told me that she set me as an editor, she doesn‚Äôt know why I can‚Äôt do anything in that column. She was like, its not because I locked you out from that column, I don‚Äôt know why it is not letting you. I told her if you are unable to do that, we can find a different solution. You can show me how to calculate it manually, and she didn‚Äôt let me to finish my sentence. And she wisely opened her eyes, she said ok I will take care of it before I go ok (the way she talked very aggressive). Then she said she gonna call the IT now. I don‚Äôt know how to deal with this person. I am still new to here, and I‚Äôm pregnant. If I told my manager about my experience with her I am afraid that they will find an excuse to fire me since she is here longer. Guys!! I really need your advice.

    "self_text": "This is long so feel free to skip, I had to get it all out. My job is very physical. Before pregnancy I had no issues but I‚Äôm starting to struggle. But I love my job overall. It‚Äôs not retail (which I despise) and I really enjoy the type of work. I make enough to have my own money and contribute to the bills which are about to over double when we move soon and have the baby.   We had a scare on Thursday. I was in a lot of pain so I went to the doctor and they suspected I had a blood clot so sent me to the ER. 9 hours later find out no blood clot thankfully so probably just a pulled muscle in my ribs and with my growing belly it hurts extremely bad. This started an ongoing disagreement between my boyfriend and I about finding a new job. He really wants me to quit. Essentially my only option is retail. The thing I hate about retail is the people. The public. On top of the demanding employer who doesn‚Äôt pay you enough to put up with all the bullshit.   I am not a people person. I‚Äôm not a chatty person. It may be bitter but even the nice customers I could care less about. Don‚Äôt talk to me, get your shit, get out, and kindly get fucked. That is what being abused by employer after employer and the general public for 10 years in the retail setting did to me. It was the worst my mental health ever was to the point I‚Äôd snap on people who didn‚Äôt deserve it, actively looked for fights, and knowingly put myself in dangerous situations. I‚Äôd even get angry when I made it out okay. If you were nice to me that almost ruined my day more.   And I‚Äôd bring every ounce of that home and ruin everyone else‚Äôs day too. I don‚Äôt like to admit those things but I was god damn angry all the time and nothing changed it until I left retail. The second I did was a breath of fresh air. My boyfriend did not know me in my retail era so he didn‚Äôt see how it all effected me, we met right after.   I‚Äôve tried explaining all of this to him but he said to me this weekend I just need to suck it up and get a new job even if I‚Äôm not going to be happy. It‚Äôs not about ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù it‚Äôs about hating my entire life, everyone around me, and my mental health getting so so much worse. Even thinking about my time in retail makes me want to commit arson.   I like my job. I know it‚Äôs a lot but I‚Äôm probably only going to work until 30 weeks anyway. And I‚Äôm supposed to take at least a $3 pay cut to do work I‚Äôm definitely not getting paid enough for  and purposefully trash my mental health? Which will probably have me end up being shitty towards my boyfriend bc that is what retail does to me. Which I understand is a poor approach and I‚Äôm an adult responsible for my own feelings but damn.   I really don‚Äôt know what he expects me to do and I‚Äôm tired of having this conversation. I completely understand he‚Äôs just worried about me but fuck dude. I‚Äôm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I‚Äôve spent all day looking for jobs and here I am pissed as hell especially at my boyfriend and he‚Äôs not even here!! This is long, sorry. But I‚Äôm so angry at even the prospect of having to work in retail again. I‚Äôve thought myself into a headache for the day.",

First off, I really do not enjoy typical baby showers... the female only parties with games no one cares about and an hour of gift opening with the guests just waiting to leave. I want to celebrate! I want a co-ed party that will actually be fun and something our guests will  want  to go to. So far, I've got a taco guy on the list & lots of alcohol.   Did you do something like this or been to a \"shower\" like this? If so, what minimal things should I look to include to still give a baby vibe without overwhelming guests to center all their attention to me and my baby? I am fine with small things on the side that people can participate in (if they choose to) that are baby related - for example, a calendar they can sign and guess baby's birthdate...  Any thoughts and ideas?",

    "self_text": "I found out today I failed my 1 hour test. I‚Äôm so upset (feeling shame, anxiety). I got 154, so I‚Äôm hoping the 3 hour will go better.    Question: My midwife said they‚Äôll refer me to a place to do my 3 hour test at my next appointment, but that isn‚Äôt for 3 weeks. When do you normally do the 3 hour test after failing the 1 hour? ASAP or after some time?   Midwife also suggested a book on GD and how I can change my diet, what to cut out, exercise etc. While I appreciate the info, I feel like she‚Äôs treating the 1 hour screening as a formal diagnosis and it‚Äôs really freaking me out.   I know this is dramatic but I have ADHD and I have a lot of trouble remembering to eat on a schedule, and often just grab a protein bar or whatnot. I know having GD will be a major lifestyle change. Of course I‚Äôm willing to do anything for my baby, but I feel so overwhelmed. I feel like I‚Äôve failed her with my laziness (I walk the dog but haven‚Äôt been active). I think pregnancy hormones are getting to me because I‚Äôm a HOT MESS about this and can‚Äôt stop crying. Pregnancy has been a big challenge for me (and joy) and I feel so vulnerable. I‚Äôm also struggling with a tough needle phobia m, I‚Äôm in therapy for it which helps, but the thought of daily needles/insulin is enough for a panic attack. Plus I know it‚Äôs silly but I‚Äôm typically a pretty healthy eater and indulging in occasional sweets has been such a comfort tool. Thanks for letting me vent. Hugs to all.   When should I get my 3 hour test? If I follow my midwife‚Äôs protocol and test in a few weeks could that make a difference?",

    "title": "Graduated 41+1, positive outcome w some traumatic aspects, stuck shoulder, induction",
    "self_text": "Up til week 41 I was barely 1 cm dilated, so my midwife and I agreed on an induction. On Thursday 2 weeks ago I was induced first using the foley balloon. They sent me home with instructions to come back at midnight, but around 6 pm I got a call saying a nurse had missed a potentially concerning deceleration in monitoring after foley insertion so they asked me to come in right then. Monitoring began, it was found that I was 3 cm dilated, and soon they started a low pitocinn drip.  The first slow 15 hours of labor I was un medicated and truly enjoying, somehow, my contractions. I spent much of this time in a birth tub‚Äî breathing deeply through contractions while listening to calming music of Sufjan Stevens. Music was a big part of my labor plan, so I alternated between calming music and more fast-paced, distracting music like that of Fiona Apple and the Mountain Goats. Everything was going really great and peacefully until an alarm went off telling me there was air in my IV. For several minutes I waited on a nurse and sat there telling my freaking out husband I loved him, bc loud blaring alarm + confusion about if this meant an embolism was fast approaching left us freaked out. A nurse eventually walked in and just flipped some switches on the iv, no biggie I totally lost my focus so I tried getting back in the labor tub again to regain it. Andddd it was ran ice cold by a nurse by accident. My calm was totally harshed and I started feeling intense pain from my contractions made worse by a panic attack presumably brought on by what I perceived as an embolism scare, nervous system shock from cold water, and increasing contraction pain. So I said fuck it and tried laughing gas as a first pain management. No luck, made no difference for me. By hour 16 the epidural crew came in and I laughed and cried through a very uneventful, easy epidural set-up.  For the next 6 hours I was on cloud nine, calling relatives and laughing + talking with my husband, enjoying our last alone time for a while. The epidural was slightly less effective in my right side but only mild tinges of occasional sensation‚Äînot even full on pain‚Äî-came through. By your 21.5 I was fully dilated.  Pushing was the coolest experience of my life. Continuing my now modified labor plan, I listened through my pushing playlist (feel good, calming, and fast paced music alike) and then through The Idler Wheel by Fiona Apple. My pushes were very consistent and strong, making me feel the most confident, empowered, and badass I‚Äôve ever felt as I steadily progressed through pushing. My husband was an amazing supporter as was a family friend who came in for the birth. The nurses and midwife were equally amazing, especially one nurse with whom I played a ‚Äútug of rope‚Äù with knotted sheets for an hour straight to aid with pushing.   And then the shit hit the fan for a few minutes. My son‚Äôs shoulder got stuck but I didn‚Äôt even realize what was going on til I heard a nurse yell ‚Äúshoulder on 8‚Äù. Like 20 or so staff swarmed in and the next thing I know my legs and pelvis are being all twisted and jarred around. A nurse yelled 60 seconds then an OB asked ‚Äúcan I push on your abdomen? It might hurt‚Äù and I was prompted to push while being pushed‚Äîscreaming bloody murder from  either pain or pressure or fear, not sure which. Then he came out at 75 seconds stuck in what felt like a cork shooting off a bottle of champagne. He was massive despite my midwife‚Äôs prediction of a 7 pounder at most.   He was taken to the other side of the room immediately to be checked out. Meanwhile I writhed a bit on the table in confusion. All the while as he came out and shortly after the very jarring, layered ‚ÄúHot Knife‚Äù by Fiona Apple is blasting and apparently I yelled out ‚Äúturn this shit off this is not the move right now‚Äù and called my mom. My husband tried to comfort me but I told him to go be near his newborn til we knew what was up.  Finally they bring me my somehow unfazed 8lb 10oz baby and I got to hold him. This kid, as I‚Äôve posted about here before, beat an IUD, a car crash at about 38 weeks, and a tough birth and lived to tell the tale.  Pregnancy and birth were a surreal, indescribable, occasionally beautiful mindfuck. I‚Äôm very proud of having grown and birthed my healthy, beautiful little Atticus.",

    "self_text": "When I was first pregnant I started to get small pains after I ate to the right of my sternum right at the top of where the belly begins to curve outward. I'm 6 months along now. As time has gone on, the pain is now there all the time. It's getting sharper. It hurts worse if I stand for a while. If I touch my skin where it hurts, the pain intensifies and is very sensitive. Sometimes it hurts to try to have a bowel movement because I have to contract the abdominal muscles to do so. I have not had any problems with constipation the entire pregnancy so I know it's not that.  I asked my doctor and she said that maybe the baby is just pushing against that side, but that seems off to me since it's been constant for the past 4 months, plus it's so high on my abdomen. My husband doesn't understand why I'm worried about it since \"it's just a pregnancy thing, and there's nothing to be done about it.\" I'm not worried about doing something about it, I just want to understand WHY it's happening. My hips are hurting too, but I understand it's because they're widening in prep for birth. It's the not understanding why my body feels this way that's driving me nuts, not the fact that it hurts and I want it to stop.  Any insights on what might be happening in my body? Has anyone else experienced this? None of the other members of my family have, and I'm at a loss.",

Or maybe the cognitive decline is progressing, we aren‚Äôt sure.   He started to decline on Thursday of last week so this past weekend was extremely hard and confusing. We get glimpses of his normal self, but then he has episodes of anxiety where he paces and pants for virtually no reason.   We have one more medication to try on him (Anipryl) and it‚Äôs supposed to be shipped tomorrow. We have gone back and forth about putting him down before I get induced on Monday, but if we did that we‚Äôd feel regret not trying this new medication. It also seems like terrible timing to put a pet down, days before labor is going to be induced.  However, when his anxiety flares up it makes us wonder if it would be better to do it before Monday. There is no right answer and I wish we had more clarity on the situation. Physically, he is fine which makes it extremely hard. Mentally, he is still there at times. I don‚Äôt know why he‚Äôs had these anxious episodes this week. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a true decline or a medication wearing off.   I‚Äôm struggling with immense guilt not only for him but for my baby. I feel like my body is under so much stress. I‚Äôve cried so much over the last few days. I feel like I‚Äôm hurting my baby when I‚Äôm supposed to protect her. Either way we spin it, I‚Äôm going to cry and stress whether we put him down now or whether we power through this week to see if the medicine helps.   I wish tomorrow was Monday so I could be induced already and not have to worry about my stress effecting my baby girl. :(",

But before it was for actual logical reasons in relation to my relationship with my partner during this pregnancy. We talked things out at the end of August and have been pretty much fine since.   However, the past month, I have been doing nothing but crying and it's only gotten worse these past two weeks. I am so miserable and I feel so bad that I just can't seem to have one good day. I look at myself in the mirror and I literally can't recognize who I am. My face is huge, my body is so inflated, my legs are so swollen and I'm in constant pain and can barely move. It's embarrassing struggling with the most basic tasks and I feel so useless and ugly and... I'm just so desperate to give birth. I didn't think I was gonna make it to my due date, but now I'm afraid I'm gonna make it past then and I legit am miserable. I feel like a worthless, hideous blob and there's literally nothing I can do about it.   We just had somewhat of an argument because my partner asked why I am crying, so I tried telling him and he just thinks it's my usual psychological problems and he was yelling at me, which I'm sure was just a result of his frustrations, but it definitely didn't make me feel any better. He said he's upset because I'm so depressed and I don't do anything about it and I tried to explain to him that this is something that I CAN'T do anything about until I give birth. Literally. I am crying every day now because I look and feel nothing like myself anymore and I am desperate to just hold my baby already. He doesn't get that though and... Idk. I just feel bad. I feel bad for being depressed all the time and I feel bad for being miserable over still being pregnant.   I'm due on Saturday, but I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna be pregnant for the next two or three weeks and I hate it. I just needed to vent, I'm sorry.",

Well, grandma is coming to visit today and i feel my anxiety going through the roof about how much she's going to touch my daughter's face. I'm going to have her sanitize before touching so that will bring me some comfort but grandma has over 20 cats at her house and I just feel like no amount of sanitizing will make it so that much face touching doesn't get my daughter sick. How do I calm my nerves? The cats aren't going anywhere so I have to find some way of accepting that her grandma is going to come from the cat house and cuddle my daughter regularly.",

    "self_text": "Hi mommies and mommies to be! I am pregnant with my 3rd (2nd trimester next week!) and I need some help here.   For context: I have had RAGING morning sickness that‚Äôs borderline HG according to my OBGYN. I‚Äôve been hospitalized once due to having gone dayyyys without being able to eat or even drink anything. Let‚Äôs be real, it‚Äôs all-day sickness. IYKYK.   That‚Äôs actually not the problem though because I‚Äôve been managing well enough since the hospitalization with the help of B-12, Zofran occasionally, and preggie pop drops / ginger supplements. I‚Äôm actually  able  to eat and drink more things now.    So here is my dilemma - I cannot, and I mean can NOT, stand the smell of meat or the taste anymore. Whatsoever! My taste buds and sense of smell have been absolutely repulsed by it. My 2 children and my husband of course still eat meat & my husband is supportive of my need to be flexitarian  if you will  but he still expects me to prepare his lunches/dinners with meat. With my first 2 I literally craved meat like no other. I would sit in front of the window to the oven and watch my steak broil with my mouth watering.   So how can I get over the aversion to smell? (I literally threw up 2x while preparing red beans & rice with spicy andouille. When I woke to the smell from the crockpot, I was sick AGAIN)   And do y‚Äôall have any vegetarian/vegan meals that you love? I‚Äôm a huge fan of most ethnic foods and have been able to adapt Indian and Hispanic dishes easily to be vegetarian, but I would love some more suggestions from people who also may have sensitive tummies and noses. Other than the meat aversion, I‚Äôm not picky!   TIA for any and all advice!",

The second time I went to the OBGYN office. The doctor who was there said that my stitches weren‚Äôt sewn too close together so they would heal by secondary intention healing. She then told me she could stitch me tighter. I asked her what the benefit would be and she said ‚Äújust to give you peace of mind‚Äù so I declined if it wasn‚Äôt necessary. Fast forward to today. I‚Äôm at the OBGYN again, but see a different doctor. She inspects my sutures and said my chart shows I refused the other doctor restitching. I told her what the other doctor said and she informed me that my sutures did in fact tear. I‚Äôm so upset because I can barely sit to breastfeed or urinate. I‚Äôm taking acetaminophen and ibuprofen, washing around the area at least once a day, changing pads very time I use the bathroom or at least ever 4 hours.

    "self_text": "I'm currently about 10 weeks along and we are thrilled, but baby was not planned and is posing a bit of a predicament!  My friend and I were originally planning going on a 3.5 week long tour around Japan in March 2020. It was all booked and paid for and we were just a couple of days away from going when the whole world shut down. Japan has been especially slow to open to tourists and only started letting people in without restrictions last month. That meant we had to postpone a few times but we have everything booked for next year, leaving at the end of March and being away most of April. Which is super exciting but that means I'll be leaving/away at the start of my 3rd Trimester.  I still really really want to go but as I've never been pregnant before I have no idea how I'm going to feel by that time. Aside from the long haul flights, our schedule is pretty packed and I worry that I will struggle to keep up. On the other hand, if we move it earlier we will miss a lot of the seasonal events and it will cost us both a lot to rebook the flights and hotels (which have all gone up in price since the borders reopened). Obviously I now have a little one to plan for and my friend is in the middle of renovating her house, so would like to avoid any extra costs if possible!  So just looking for some personal anecdotes/experiences of other people, how were you feeling physically and mentally around the 29-33week mark? Do you think you would have been able to handle a trip at that stage? To anyone who has travelled in that window, any advice for me?  Thank you!",

Since he's due at the end of March and it'll be getting warmer, he won't need heavy winter clothes. But I'm wondering if anyone has experience/insight on what clothing items I'll need from end of March through the summer, and what sizes/how much. I don't want to end up being a clothing hoarder with a ton of unworn clothes, but I want to make sure I have enough too. Thanks in advanceü•∞  Edit to add that I'm asking, because I'm hoping to put clothing items on my registry! That way we get things we like and will actually use. Just figuring out how much to put on there is so hard!",

My sister and her husband had a few miscarriages and have been trying for a while, so this is really exciting news!   My sister and I are super close and always have been. To make a long story short, I‚Äôve been there through everything. This past year or so, I‚Äôve driven to appointments, been a lending ear, have supported her through the losses, etc.   They officially announced their pregnancy about three weeks ago and since have been showered with gifts. Baby outfits, bibs, etc. I stopped over this morning to drop off some homemade soup bc both my sister and brother-in-law have a terrible cold. My sister quickly showed me all the things they‚Äôve already received for the new baby and I immediately felt guilt stricken‚Ä¶ Should I have bought a physical gift to celebrate this? What would you (as a pregnant person) want from your sister?   I guess I‚Äôm asking bc I‚Äôm much more of a ‚Äúpractical‚Äù gifts person in other aspects of my life and I feel like I missed something obvious here.   Thanks in advance!

    "self_text": "As the title suggests, I feel like I'm surrounded by people who are going through difficult time.   My sister has recently had a miscarriage, and my immediate family are all surrounding her at the moment, giving her support. We've been in contact, but understandably she doesn't want to be around me right now, so I'm missing out on family gatherings.   Two out of five of my closest friends have infertility issues, and have progressively found my pregnancy to be triggering for them. They've needed to keep their distance from me, which has made it challenging for the overall group dynamic and meeting up.   I understand everyone's in pain, I truly do. I hope this doesn't come across as selfish, but I am also grieving this experience for myself too. I haven't had much excitement for my baby who is due in a month recently. Instead of feeling surrounded by support, like I was expecting, I've felt like a bad presence. I think the most challenging thing is how silenced I feel. I know the pain they feel is a thousand times worse, but I feel pain too. To them, I have everything they want, but inside I'm hurting.   I'm not saying any of this to them, and I never would. I know they're not intentionally making me feel lonely and unsupported.   Can anyone relate?  EDIT: thankyou so much for these comments. I was honestly expecting a lot of \"suck it up and get on with it\" type comments, but it's meant the world to be empathised with instead.   I want to clarify that my Mom and siblings do offer me support by either visiting me seperately or sending me a message after spending a day with her and haven't shut me out completely, so I'm not totally alone. It's more that they've been going along with this recurring pattern of running to her house, finding out I'm not invited and doing nothing about it, which is something I hoped being pregnant would change despite what my sister is going through. When our baby is here, I can imagine (hope) the attention will also shift, if not for me, for our baby.   My partner is also incredible. Seeing him getting frustrated at these family dynamics has really opened my eyes over the years and made me realise that it perhaps wasn't all my fault or always deserved, as whenever I tried to call it out in the past, I got responses like \"well sometimes you are a bit quiet\" or \"everyone should keep in touch\", implying that I don't try and therefore meeting without me is justified.   Because of your empathy, I've also reached out to a couple of friends and told them that I've been sad I haven't felt able to share my joy with them. These have been healing conversations, and made me realise I don't have to create this dynamic in future relationships, just because it started with my family. No one is a mind reader!",

Over-Commercialization of parenthood (we are getting everything second-hand and since we decided to have a baby, have also saved for it. We don‚Äôt need gifts or assistance.

Claim just came through for $1775.00 this morning.  The plan discount is 1290.00 leaving us with 484.00 to pay out of pocket (Haven't hit deductible for the year).  That seems extremely steep.

    "title": "Funny Birth Story--Plus, Possibly Useful Tips for Expectant Fathers and Partners",
    "self_text": "My wife and I welcomed our boy into the world two weeks ago.  He's fantastic and we're both overjoyed at finally being parents.  The birth went as smoothly as we could hope for, albeit earlier than we expected.  We had our last OB appointment in which our doctor said everything was going well and she wouldn't be surprised if we had a baby within a week.  Well, that very night my wife's water broke at 12:30.  There was concern about infection if we waited too long to get things rolling so we gathered our things and set off for the hospital.  By 4 am we were in early labor (with the help of some induction drugs).  We both tried to sleep but it wasn't happening, so we spent a lot of time moving positions in the bed, walking around the room, and doing the labor dance (I don't know where to find the actual steps we learned in our class, but this is essentially it--it really helps spread the pelvis.)  By 6 am, my wife opted for the epidural which certainly helped with the pain but also made her right leg slip into another dimension.  Now that she was hooked in with the drugs and monitors, she was bedbound which was a challenge all its own.  I became The Lifter of the Leg and Mediator of the Cords for whichever position she thought sounded comfortable and would help move things along.  I wish we had read up on good body positions for  after  the epidural goes in because your options become severely limited.  I will say that the peanut ball scored high marks in usefulness.  So our doctor and the folks who taught our birthing classes had all sung the praises of the love hormone oxytocin for a smooth delivery.  There's plenty of sciencey literature out there that I don't fully understand explaining why it works, but my takeaway in prepping for the birth was get that oxytocin flowing.  You do that by making her comfortable; you do that with massages; you do that with reassuring words and a calming demeanor; you do that by making her feel loved.  Which brings me to the bit my wife and I are still laughing about.  Our doctor had predicted a birth around 2 pm, but 2 rolled around and she decided it would be another hour or two.  So she left my wife and I alone in the delivery room.  We just stared at each other, feeling a bit defeated and entirely exhausted.  We had both been awake for over 36 hours at this point and the thought of multiple hours ahead of us was a bit daunting.  It was at that point that my wife said \"come give me a hug.\"  She pulled me in close, we pressed our foreheads together, and we gave each other tender kisses and head rubs.  I kid you not, within ten seconds of us getting all lovey-dovey, the door burst open, in rush our doctor and three nurses fully decked out in PPE shouting:  #\"The monitors say this baby is ready to rock and roll!\"  Oxytocin is a hell of a thing.",

    "self_text": "Cross posted in the parenting sub. I wasn‚Äôt asking for advice necessarily, mainly just to vent and get it off my chest. But the comforting words others have given me have definitely helped tremendously, so maybe this post can help someone else in a similar situation. Even just relating to others can be helpful sometimes so.  Last night in the middle of my 12 hour shift (nurse), a girl sent me screen shots of messages that my boyfriend had sent her just two days earlier trying to hook up with her.  I‚Äôm currently 18 weeks and 4 days pregnant with our first child.   Our daughter was very much unexpected but I knew from the moment I saw those two pink lines that I would do whatever I had to in order to give her a happy, healthy life. Him on the other hand.. despite his outwards excitement, he‚Äôs made numerous comments that to me seem almost like he‚Äôs excited to SAY he has a kid. Although we‚Äôve had numerous discussions when it comes to parenting styles, I still felt off about it however I tried to tell myself that was own trauma coming to the surface and give the benefit of the doubt.   At the same time, without going into many details, he was involved in some legal troubles prior to us dating. They are still ongoing. I was fully aware from day one, my only condition was that I would not allow myself to get too enmeshed in his problems, but I told him that I would be there to support him. I just didn‚Äôt want to be involved in the details (example: not going to his court dates, etc)   Ultimately he could be looking at prison time depending on how his next court appearance goes. He has a good lawyer, so he‚Äôs been hopeful. But since I learned that I was pregnant, I started to feel that his problems were now my problems and most importantly, my daughters problems. So I started going with him to talk to his lawyer (he asked me to) and asking questions, I started doing research on what we should expect from the trial, and basically educating myself on what the outcomes could mean for my kids future. And with that, he became more dependent on me and seemed to take on less responsibility.   All of this has made me feel regretful. Not for my daughter, but for the choices I‚Äôve made. Not for myself, but for her. My biggest fear from day one was bringing her into a world that wasn‚Äôt good enough for her, but I chose to believe in him and in us together as parents. I chose to bring her into this world, and I chose the wrong person to do that with. I truly believed that we would work together and be a team for her. I worry now that he will not pull his weight, and I‚Äôm worried what coparenting will look like for us. I don‚Äôt understand how he could do this to HER.   Now I feel like I‚Äôve let her down before she‚Äôs even born.   Everyone around me is angry at him for betraying me, but I feel nothing. Nothing for myself at least. I‚Äôve cried once, and that‚Äôs only because I feel so horrible for my daughter. Everything that I thought I had figured out for her is gone in an instant. A stable happy home to raise her in (he just bought a house that we were in the process of remodeling and moving into), two parents that love her and love each other.. it‚Äôs all just gone. I‚Äôm so scared that one day she will resent me for bringing her into a broken family. His family is very supportive of me and want to be a part of her life, however my own family has not supported me since they learned I was pregnant. I‚Äôve struggled with accepting that, however he reassured me multiple times that he would always be a safety net for us.   I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm still processing it or what, but all I feel is hurt for my daughter. I don‚Äôt know if I will wake up angry tomorrow, or next week, or at all. And I know that deep down, it will all be okay because she has plenty of people that will love her and make sure she‚Äôs taken care of. And I know plenty of people who are able to successfully coparent even after a bad separation. I try to be hopeful, but it breaks my heart.   I‚Äôm not really looking for advice, although good advice would be greatly appreciated. Mainly just looking to scream this all into the void and hope that it‚Äôll help me get out of this numb state of mind where I feel so lost.",

    "self_text": "What I wish I knew: labour, c section, epidural, preparedness.  I‚Äôve been here for a while and recently was anxiously reading other graduation posts thinking my time would never come. I was totally fine being pregnant and then things seemed to really slow done once my due date past and I‚Äôm incredibly impatient and like a plan, so it drove me nuts.  I was due oct 23rd, scheduled for a cervical ripening on Sunday, October 30th and an induction on the 31st just over 12 hours later. I left the appointment on Sunday feeling fine, I was dilated 1cm and my OB said she was hoping to see me get to 3cm by by appointment at 11am. I came home, had some food and tried to get to bed, but within half an hour everything turned around. I started having contractions, my food was coming back up, and my stools were watery, consistent, and suddenly burning. I woke my partner up at 1:30 and said we had to go. Got to the hospital at 2 and I was already 3cm dilated. The back labour was intense and the nurse working at the time wasn‚Äôt amazing, so nothing happened between then and 8am when my OB came to check me and said I was 5cm dilated and ready to get admitted and an epidural if I wanted. I wanted.  I always knew I‚Äôd consider the epidural but had my own concerns, my contractions were unmanageable and had been happening several hours by this point, so I happily accepted some relief. I didn‚Äôt feel the epidural at ALL and the relief was almost instant. I had 3 contractions while they were putting it in but a great team got me through it. I had a second fear about the catheter, I felt that even less. Literally didn‚Äôt feel a thing, not pain nor discomfort.   My water was broken at 9am and that felt no different than any cervical check.  From there, I got to 7cm dilated and didn‚Äôt progress for several hours. Started pitocin, eventually got to 9, then again didn‚Äôt move for several hours. A c section was presented to me on the 31st around 5 pm and I was super nervous about it so I asked to keep going the way we were going. I eventually laboured for 26 hours and stayed stuck at 9cm. Baby was safe, but a c section was brought up again and I decided to take the leap. By this point I was mentally exhausted and physically drained. I hadn‚Äôt slept through all the monitoring and all of the waiting was doing me in. I was nervous about being awake and knowing I was being operated on. Nervous about how anxious I‚Äôd be and how much I‚Äôd freak myself out sitting with just my thoughts as I layed there. It was all fine.  I wish I knew how much I‚Äôd love my stroller fan on the side of the bed. This was probably the most useful thing I packed. I was constantly hot and it dead used a ton. It clipped onto the side of the bed and made me so comfortable.  I wish I knew the epidural was so easy and pain free. Purely just relief.  I wish I knew a c section was not bad at all. My partner sat next to me in the OR and spoke to me the whole time, keeping my anxiety at bay. I wasn‚Äôt cold, but I shook a LOT. He kept me so distracted, and as soon as I heard my baby,  saw my baby, and got to watch him hold our baby, I wasn‚Äôt concerned about what was happening beyond the drape.   I wish I had chosen the c section route sooner rather than draining myself with more labour and that‚Äôs the only thing I‚Äôd do differently if I were to do it again. I was walking roughly 6 hours later and doing totally fine. Discharged at 31 hours and now home with baby. It‚Äôs a bit tough to get out of bed or sit up alone but also doable. I haven‚Äôt had issues with anything else and now I don‚Äôt need to worry about that dreaded first poop, pain while urinating, potential tears.   I'm happy and healthy and so is baby.",
