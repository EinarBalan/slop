    "title": "How do I split food costs with my roommate who eats more than I do?",
    "self_text": "I am Asian and like to cook large family style meals where we share side dishes and eat rice as a base. I do a majority of our cooking for us and buy most of the food. However, because I get tired after cooking, I usually only eat small portions. I'm more of a nibbler and go for small bites of a variety of dishes. In my experience of Asian family-style eating, you have to be cognizant of what other are eating and moderate yourself so that others also get portions of all the sides, however my roommate (White) is not used to this and will finish all the dishes before I get a chance to eat much of anything. We've had conversations about this and I get the feeling that they think I am fat-shaming them for eating more than I do and for me paying attention to how much they eat. I've struggled with eating enough in the past (with the opposite problem--avoidant eating disorder) so I can empathize and that's why I kinda dropped the conversation. They've continued eating most of the food and to be honest, I was fine with this because I actually don't require many calories (BMI likes to stay around 15) and wouldn't be able to finish the food before they go bad anyways, but recently I have been financially strapped and food costs have gone up so I was wondering if it would be fair to ask them to contribute more? We currently split the food 50/50, but because I buy most of the food, I feel awkward asking them to pay more because I am the one choosing what to buy / eat. Cooking separately isn't really an option because they don't have time to cook and everything I make has too many portions for one person. I know I could probably just make less, but with most of the recipes I do, you kinda have to make a bigger portion for it to taste flavorful. I also like cooking more than eating so to me getting all the ingredients and making fun dishes is kind of the hobby--I could probably find ways to save more, but that would probably mean we have less food to share. What would be a good way to bring this up in conversation?   Any advice appreciated.",

What happened to those? Why are there no memory expanders for modern systems? Sure we still have memory slots on most  desktop  computers, but back in the day, you had memory slots  and  memory expanders for when you inevitably use up your slots or so you didn't have to throw away your existing memory by replacing them with higher density ones, you could just add more if you had a spare expansion slot. The PCIe 4.0 protocol, including gen 4 M.2 slots, is in theory faster than a channel of DDR4, and PCIe already has direct memory access from the CPU (hell the CPU can now even directly access the memory of a discrete PCIe device, like a graphics card), so what's stopping us from making a PCIe or M.2 card with RAM chips on it and making it directly addressable by the CPU as normal working memory?",

I don't really have parental guidance so I am winging this but I am quitting my job immediately though I gave them a four weeks notice (two days left/Sunday and Thursday) and honestly the environment isn't doing me or my school performance any good.  Does anyone have recommendations for what to include in the letter? I am thinking that I will state irreconcilable differences and that to benefit myself and the work environment I will be leaving early. Also, I will be taking up another job on campus which will be more friendly to my chaotic schedule and friendly in general so are there any risks of the job I am currently at getting in the way of that job? They are technically two different entities but I am still concerned and want to be prepared.   &#x200B;  Thanks!",

Personally my thought has always been if your going to swim and your at the beach, why would you want to swim in a pool?

Since they are both outdoors, it's not like a \"oh if weather on the beach is bad you still have a water body to swim in\" because if it's bad to swim in 1 it's bad to swim in the other. I know a really stupid question, but if someone could share the vision people building/using these pools have instead of using the gigantic, presumably equally swimable body of water they presumably chose the hotel to be near?",

Apple on the other hand sells a lot of phones and a lot of computers, but not to such amount to be even close to dominate said markets. 10 years ago sure, the iPhone was the absolute best phone, the MacBook reinvented the personal computer and the iPad was the only tablet worth owning, but now?

Loosely cover the jar and leave at room temperature. This process should take a few days. You will notice small bubbles and “activity” occurring inside the jar. At this point, all the raisins should be floating at the top. The jar should smell like wine.

My exposure to US and western society is quite limited at best and outdated at worse so I apologise in advance if my facts and assumptions are obsolete.  &#x200B;  I've recently started university in the US and this whole race thing is confusing to me. To me it seems like there's this push by the government, mostly the progressive side, for over-representation an institutes.   &#x200B;  Wikipedia says that 57.8% of the population is white, 18.7% Hispanic/Latino, 12.1% black, 5.9% Asian.   &#x200B;  With those numbers in mind, isn't it normal for, say government positions, to be mostly comprised of white Americans? I don't really understand, maybe because I don't know much of American history or culture, but there seems to be this idea of trying to enroll a disproportionate amount of minorities into certain areas of society (colleges, government positions, workplaces etc.)  &#x200B;  If some minorities are over-represented in one area whether it be due to genetics or upbringing, that's one thing. But it seems like the government ignores it when minorities are disproportionately represented (in basketball for example), yet they intervene with measures such as affirmative action and hiring quotas when a space is dominated by a white majority.  &#x200B;  Just to be clear, I'm not trying to make this a white vs minority races argument, but rather a majority vs minority argument. People wouldn't emigrate to a country like China or Japan and make an issue of the fact that their governments are dominated by ethnic Han Chinese and ethnic Japanese respectively.",

But the majority of things I thought you were a wimp if you went to the doctor.   I also thought you were a wimp if you took care of minor injuries. Like if your knee hurt so you took the elevator, I thought that was weak. Or taking a sick day when you weren’t dying or something. I took pride in how I would keep pushing past my limits.   Now I’m 27 and I know that was dumb.   I’m in the process of learning that it’s ok to take a sick day if you’re too sick. It’s ok to stop your workout if you’re in bad pain. It’s ok to take the elevator if you hurt your knee.   I’m in therapy working on the underlying mental nonsense behind being mean to myself like that.

But through day it is no problem for me to sleep because for me it is better to do all the stuff through night.  My problem is that I more like night than day because it is dark, silent, every one is asleep so no one is disturbing me from watching anime like through day. I sleep 6 to 8 hours a day and then I am on my computer rest of the time. Most of the time I am online on sites like Discord or playing games, watching anime and more. My question is if it would be problem for my mental state and my body health to switch that I would eat and sleep through day and then be awake and do all the stuff through night.

Tbh, when I hear the name \"Josef\" it sort of helps me remember that Mengele is the one that was possibly the worst human being ever to exist.

We had a huge argument about it and my parents threatened to view my messages, calls, and photos sent at our phone provider (T-Mobile). Despite that I’m a 20 year old still under my parents’ roof, have a part time job, and currently enrolled in a trade school, it’s nerve wrecking that they’re willing to invade my privacy over me chatting online with high boundaries.  I panicked harshly, but then threatened me if I refuse to let them view my texts and stuff, they will kick me out of the house.  While I never sent anything inappropriate or shared personal info, my parents are still willing to check my phone history. I’m very reserved of my privacy, and I don’t want them to see all my stuff, which I think will include Discord, my Gmails, browsing history, and probably here too.  I need some sort of miracle of an answer since my parents are so paranoid about all this :(",

His best friend (24) - and best man (although he did a lousy job as a best man but that's another story) came with his girlfriend (24). She doesn't really like us, any of her boyfriend's friends for that matter.  I don't know whether or not that had an effect on the wedding gift they gave us or not. But it appears that they didn't put much thought into it.   What we got from them was huge. And all wrapped up so we were really excited to open it. You could tell it was a painting or picture by the size and form of it. It is approximately as wide/big as a desk.  But when we opened it a few days after the party at home... We both awkwardly pretended to like it. Mind you, it was only my husband and I but I didn't want to make him sad since it was a gift by his best friend.  They printed a picture of us with a cheesy line on a huge canvas - with a horrible dark red color as a background. Not a color I have in my apartment at all. And they took the picture from Instagram. It is probably the ugliest picture I have on my account. There are 1000 pictures that are cuter and/or prettier. But alas, it is what it is.  My husband and I share a tiny apartment so I always said we don't have the space to hang it on the wall. But one day, I couldn't hold it in any longer and told him how sorry I was but that I didn't like the picture, the size, the cheesy line, the color, and that I don't want it hanging in my apartment. Luckily, he felt the same.  Now we are wondering how we can get rid of it? So far, it is standing still in the box it came in on the wall in the bedroom. When his best friend comes around, he might expect it to be hanging somewhere. And we don't want to hurt his feelings. And they probably paid some good money for it.  What do we say or do?",

    "self_text": "Not sure if it's just me, but sometimes I'd be falling asleep with music playing in the background, and if I wake up after a while and the music is still playing I the background, it will often sound incredible, not even on the same level of music enhancement you get on drugs, but everything just sound heavenly, emotional and flawless, like it was made by God himself. I usually get very intense euphoria and sometimes even about to tear up becuase of how good it is, all the notes and melodies, just sounds so beautiful. This state doesn't last long though, anywhere from 30 seconds to one minute at best, but sometimes I'd intentionally put music when being tired and drift on and off between sleep and waking up, experiencing this feeling repeatedly. The music enhancements remains only as long as I keep my eyes closed after waking up, sometimes accompanied by hypnagogic hallucinations.   Is there any scientific reason for this phenomenon or am I just weird?",

For example, if you have cancer, do you have to pay for all treatments such as chemo yourself? Or something completely different, like asthma? Don't a lot of people die just because they don't have money for treatment then? I really don't understand how the health care works in America so sorry of it 's a stupid question but NoStupidQuestions right?!",

The iceberg lettuce head is more than double the weight of the can of Coke yet has approximately 50 less calories.  Or another way to look at it....  There's about 300 calories for example in a 2 ounce bag of cotton candy from the fair. Its volume and mass is huge, yet it's not dense at all and doesn't weigh much, it's just spun sugar.   Compared to a single Big Mac from McDonalds, which is 7.5 ounces and has 565 calories. But its volume (from picturing it) is probably a quarter of a size of cotton candy from the fair.  Or a drink, such as a Coca Cola can, it's 12 ounces (almost double a big mac) but has only 150 calories. It's volume (from picturing it) is probably slightly less than a Big Mac.",

I hastily opened the package, pulled out the box that is \"supposed\" to contain the headphones, and... nothing. There are no headphones in the box. Sony XM4s come with this little oval-ish container that is supposed to store the headphones and the associated cables. That container is in the box, and the container does have some kind of audio jack cable and some kind of USB cable that I assume is the charge cable, but there's a huge indentation containing a cutout that is pretty clearly the place where the headphones are supposed to be, and it's just empty.  I didn't really look at the Amazon package too closely, but it looked sealed to me. I'm not sure what happened or how. What am I supposed to do in this scenario? I've never had this kind of issue with Amazon before. I've had packages get lost, but never like this. I don't know if I can request a refund based on \"missing parts or items\" when it's basically the main \"object\" in the package that's missing.

    "self_text": "When I was around 15 I loved writing more than anything, and started on writing a story I'm still developing today (having just turned 19). My therapist was one of the only people I felt safe showing my writing to, and he convinced me to post the first chapter of my story to a writing feedback site.  Then someone on that site absolutely tore apart my writing. For nearly every word they had a new chunk of criticism. Some of it was valid but most incredibly harsh. It destroyed my confidence and to this day I still can't get it back. I now know that I have rejection sensitive dysphoria, explaining why this hit me so hard. Obviously writers need to be able to take criticism, but my dysphoria makes this incredibly difficult.  I've been told many times to learn to take criticism, to let it go, to not take it personally. But honestly I don't know HOW to do these things. I don't even know where to start. I rationally know that criticism aimed at my writing isn't a personal slight to me, I rationally know that that was just one very critical person. None of this has helped me get over my insecurity, and I've barely written anything in the last 4 years. I'm always scared of showing my writing to even my closest friends, and feel like the amount of distress and shame from writing literally anything isn't worth the enjoyment or any positive feedback I could potentially get.  I want my love of writing back so badly; telling stories brings me more happiness than anything. And I want to get over myself, but I just don't know how. Does anyone have any advice?

    "self_text": "So this is my first time posting here but yesterday i was at sephora and i found a perfume i really likes it’s Lancome La Vie Est Belle and i was checking the prices and realized something. Now this is why i’m here, i don’t know much about money and pricing so i want advice. the 30ml one was 950 Liras and the 50 ml one was 1870 Liras. When you do the math if you buy 2 of the 30 ml ones u get 60 ml with only 30 Liras more and that just doesn’t sit right with me. The pricing is completely off and buying the 50 ml one is a bad deal but producing two bottles costs money so shouldn’t they push people to but the 50 ml one? i was just wondering if anyone knows the prices are like that.",

We quickly hit it off as we have similar tastes in video games, but over time, I've come to find that he has a lot of psychological issues and has some really weird beliefs. In particular, he really hates the phrase \"white privilege\" and seems to believe a lot of the Covid 19/alt-right conspiracy theories while not being very political outside of that. Recently he brought up about how he was happy that \"Nancy Pelosi got justice\" and I took the bait and asked what Nancy Pelosi did, and he couldn't give me a real issue outside of \"I just dont like her\" and a link to a Bing search of what Nancy Pelosi has done that's bad.  Now I know I can just block this guy, but I am fairly certain that I am his only friend and to be honest, I am a loser myself and he is pretty much my only friend which is why I have talked to him for so long. But I don't want to associate with people like this, and at the same time, this guy has some psychological disorders and I wouldn't want the sudden shock if having no one to talk to lead him to suicide or any other problems.

    "self_text": "Tldr at bottom (sorry for bad grammer and writing, I left school due to ptsd reasons not fully involving school)  So when I was growing up, people in middle/high-school would judge anyone in the group who was using anything other than Apple products were ridiculed and judged. People always teased them.  Me however, I'm tech dumb so to say, I had iPhones starting in 7th grade because she wanted to get a hold of me easier, and the deals at the time for iPhone 4-6 where a deal, and since my friends got them earlier than me I just thought it must be a good phone. Plus I was 12. When the android or any other phone users got judged I was unaware why but was to scared to speak up. But from my friends I assumed android was bad but still not a reason to bully. Some groups would even exclude friends due to it, it was harsh  I had iPhones up until 18, then when I moved in with my bf he switched me to android(he bought me a new phone due to reasons I can't say.), I was really confused at first but I love my phone. I think I have a galaxy s8 pro or something like that.  Which is not the newest I think at this point;with Apple that would've meant the new updates wouldn't work and I couldn't play anything and it sucked;however I can play all the games I'm interested in, it wasn't shit crazy expensive, I have so much room compared to what I used to on my iPhone.   And I generally have more fun learning about all the cool customizations(some to the help of my bf). It was way more than Apple had offered to me at that point(unless I paid like 5000, I'm not getting 64g storage and all the other cool features I got for my cameras and stuff)(which people in high-school would and I see on tik tok now make fun of)) I don't get the jokes on camera it works so well if you learn how to use it.  TLDR Iphone sucks and $$$$ Android good Do all ages care about what phone people have and do they exclude you from groups because of that.",

Before this, About Three weeks ago, I told my parents that if someone wants to adopt my cats they can talk to me because I want to make sure I'm giving my cat to a responsible person that can really take care of them,  the reason I told them that is because I was just diagnosed with mild allergy from animal fur(causing runny nose). I don't really want to do that since I've been taking care of them for 1 year and 5 months. I don't always hold them and I thought the runny nose was caused by dust and smoke since we live in the countryside.  Now I'm stressed for thinking about their situation, everytime I think about them I want to go there and bring them back to our house, I'm always thinking it's not that far just 15 minutes drive and 30 minutes hiking. My father go there every other day and I heard from my sister that he's feeding them when he's eating lunch but that's it. I don't really know what to do, I know it's for my own good that they did that but I can't help but worry about them. I want to forget them but it's really hard for me to do that.",

    "self_text": "Hi,  I'm writing about the card-present payment processing landscape and I am having some trouble understanding all the different parties involved in a process of card transactions. How I understand it right now, we have three parties    Acquiring institution - this is where the merchant has an account and that acquirers the funds for the merchant    Card network - Visa/Mastercard/AMEX and etc networks that communicate between acquiring institution and issuing bank while cashing on the scheme fees    Issuer bank - this is the retail bank that the shopper's debtit/credit card is issued from    I.e. if I buy a 3$ coffee, the ammount goes from issuer bank, that takes a percentage (interchange fee), through the card network like Visa's where Visa takes scheme fees and then finally to acquiring institution where the acquirer takes acquiring merchant fee and then the actual vendor is left with let's say the original amount - 1-3% (in the UK).  My question is, where do companies like worldpay, BarclayCard belong in this process? Furthermore, whats the difference between these companies which are used a lot by huge chains like Starbucks, H&M and etc and companies like Square, SumUP, Zettle which are being used by some small coffee shops.",

    "self_text": "I have a long term friend that's a year and a half younger than me, and she's kind of like my little sister.  But she's into some super concerning shit. For one, she's into snake vore. And not normal vore, like, snake humanoid slit vore? With teeth. And feelers. Literally some of the most terrifying art I've ever seen. A year ago she used to send it in the small group chat and made all of us sick to our stomachs. I asked her to stop multiple times but she couldn't comprehend how it was gross or weird and kept trying to defend herself. I had to firmly put my foot down and tell her NONE OF US wanted to see that. It made her sad and I felt bad.   She struggles with making friends and everyone bullies her and finds her weird, and as her big sister figure I feel really bad for her.   She hasn't sent NSFW in a long time, but she has this weird obsession with anthro men with full animal heads that are Overly buff, like uncomfortably buff, with big stomachs, thick necks, like the stereotypical borderline Deviantart artwork that made people leave Deviantart because it was so gross. She uses them as profile pictures often and sends them in the group chat.   Same issue where she finds them attractive and tries to force it on our friend group and acts like it's normal and instead of being hurt when I say its gross now she judges me for not liking it.   Yesterday I tried to encourage her to use a normal profile picture by matching with me. Her pfp was literally just an anime girl and my little sister figure got so upset and refused which SHOCKED me. She said I was mocking her by trying to get her to use a human profile picture and came for my throat over it. She said she preferred the buff animal men and was just 'like that' and didn't like real people.   We made up, but I just feel so horrible. Shes only been 17 for a few months and I've known her for three years.   Her home life is rough, basic things like art are a privilege she has to earn, which is hard for her because she loves to draw and she's good at it, and she's not allowed to express basic freedoms like what decorations she can have in her room, but I don't know how that could have caused this weird taste she has.   I just wish I knew how to help.",

Edit: Just to clarify, my question has more to do with the dangers that smoking has on non-smokers, like kids of smokers, coworkers of smokers who inhale stuff after the smoker gets back from a smoke break, or even just bystanders who breathe in whatever is stuck on a smoker’s clothes - even if you can’t smell the smoke anymore.",

In a lot of cases of a severe enough allergy, the body goes into anaphylaxis: fainting, light-headedness and difficulty breathing.  What would happen if the body didn’t do this? Is this theoretically possible? That someone is allergic to, say, peanuts but the body doesn’t detect the peanuts? Or is anaphylaxis basically a sign of allergy? The body just randomly decides either at birth or from prolonged exposure that peanuts are bad?  Sorry if this is an especially dumb question. Thanks in advance.",

What made it even worse was that she'd never acted like that toward anyone else. I tried confronting but that went under the rug. From what I know, I never did anything bad toward her, so that's even more confusing. Eventually, she stopped talking and caring about my presence, so I had no choice but to distance myself.

None of them are bad people but they have hurt me deeply and possible irreparably because of their obvliviousness and mental problems and ignorance. I've been dealing with anxiety and depression (and possible autism) since I was a preteen. And being here makes it so much worse and even my therapist agrees that the best thing I can do is move out.  I'm also an artist. I dream of working in an animation studio and make that my life's work. But I really can't study that in my country. I had a plan to go to the US to study what I want but recently that plan was ruined by my own impulsiveness.  So I really need help with this. How can I leave my home and country, go to the US, and be able to study digital animation? I have barely enough money for a plane ticket and about a month of food and other necessities. I cannot afford rent.  I want to know if it's a good idea to get student loans to study there and live in the dorms. Would I be able to pay them if I got a job and worked hard on my own?  The problem is, my mom was overprotective my whole life and never let me do anything on my own. I am almost 19 right now and I can barely do anything on my own. I don't know how anything works. And I'm working towards fixing that but I do need help to understand everything I'm mentioning here.  I also don't really know how getting a visa works or which one I should get or how I can get it or if I need it for student loans.  I really need help to figure out how to make the most out of all the money I've saved during my teenager years to move out, while also being able to follow my dream of working as an animator.  I don't know how anything works. I wish I hadn't been so overprotected in my childhood. I wish I knew the things I'm supposed to know. Please, help me understand how to get to a better place. Thank you and have a nice day.",

    "self_text": "I have a gym at my university, but it is always packed. All other gyms are too far away to commute to them. I have never been to the gym before. How do I start doing gym exercises without hurting myself? Note: I messed up my shoulder bad by incorrectly doing bench presses in my 10th grade sports therapy lab. I also get really intimidated by all of the big guys in the gym and how everyone knows what they are doing. I am too scared to ask someone for help, I am now asking for advice on how to learn how to workout. Also, how do I get to available machines to workout when the gym is completely packed?",

    "self_text": "So I went to the ER early one morning and they found a pretty serious issue (not Covid related) and admitted me. I’ve been in the hospital now for 5 days, and still not certain when I will be out. The moment I found out I was going to have to stay overnight the first night (about 2pm) I texted my GM as that was how I was instructed to communicate with her. I provided some details and apologized profusely for the situation, letting her know I wasn’t sure when I would be able to be back to work, but that I was willing to provide any necessary doctors notes or even face time call from the hospital so she knows I’m not lying. She failed to respond to me at any point that day. The next day, she’s in the group chat about a situation that happened in the store, so I take the opportunity to message her directly again. I was polite and asked for her direction on how to proceed, because her silence concerned me that I may not have a job anymore. Still no response from her. A lot happened at the hospital with me so I wasn’t able to message her again until today, at which point I bluntly asked if I am fired. That was mid-morning and she STILL has yet to respond.  Background: it’s a new job that I’ve only worked 3 shifts at so far, and we’ve already had an issue with her scheduling me outside of my availability because her management team failed to communicate with her what it was (I have provided it, written down, 4 times since the interview). I’m still in the hospital, so talking to her in person is not an option. I have never experienced anything like this before and would appreciate some Reddit guidance. Is her ghosting me legal? Should I report this situation to corporate? Should I say screw it and file for unemployment until I’m healthy again?  Should I tuck my tail and return to work once I’m released? Please, any guidance y’all can throw my way would be tremendously appreciated.",

There is no more space in the house, so as a result I need to use my own small-ish double room now.  Typically I have 1.5 drying racks of clothes to dry (screenshot representation of the racks). I also cannot open my window much due to loud traffic and my door is mostly closed due to roommates.  Therefore I was wondering, if I were to get this type of dehumidifer and placed it next to the two racks inside my small double room (with the windows and door unable to be opened), would this setup adequately keep my room from becoming too humid/stuffy/smelly due to the amount of clothes drying? And would it dry the clothes in a reasonable amount of time to avoid mold? Does anyone have any estimates as to how long they would take to dry?",

That being said, I'm sure plenty of people don't really know any lawyers. I am one of these people: I never got into legal trouble and none of my friends are lawyers, so I have never really interacted with one. Hell, I wouldn't even know where to start even if I had all the time in the world, so I would have to go through lots of internet searches and phone calls to find a lawyer for a non-urgent matter.   Now, if I get arrested tomorrow, and I request a lawyer, who should I contact? How do I find a decent lawyer? How much time does one get to pick a lawyer?   Maybe I watch too much TV but public defenders are often depicted as having too many clients and being unable to give 100% to all of them (despite their best efforts, don't get me wrong). It seems a good idea to hire the best lawyer one can afford, if it makes the difference between walking free and spending the next days (years?) in jail.   I assume if I get arrested the situation would be urgent enough that I won't have time to call a dozen lawyers, compare them, check their qualifications and whether they seem any good etc.   What should one do in a situation like this? Just get the first (available) lawyer one can find?",
