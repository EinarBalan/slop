    "self_text": "I miss RPAN popping up in my feed. I came across quite a few awesome artists through it, and wish they would've made it optional rather than take it away entirely.  However, before it went away, at least a few times per day I was seeing people complaining about it. \"It's always just some guy/girl with a guitar!\"   I don't really understand why that's a problem. There were also plenty of those streams of people bedroom DJing, which I'm not a fan of in any capacity, but I'm fairly certain this is my first time ever even mentioning it because I don't expect the internet to cater to my tastes. I just scrolled onwards.  So ultimately, I'm hoping someone can help me understand why it bothered people so much to see people enjoying their time broadcasting themselves playing/singing with a guitar? Why was guitar specifically being singled out?",

    "self_text": "Or are they just a complete scam?  I know there are plenty of people that are terrible at managing money, but even if you have 8-10 subscriptions that’s still very manageable and doesn’t really need a specific service (that will charge you money) to specifically cancel a few subscriptions.  The only subscription I have is Amazon Prime, and it’s zero work to manage it. I order stuff off Amazon >10x/year, so it’s very worth it to me.  FYI: The way they’re supposed to work is that if someone has 10 subscriptions, they cancel the ones you don’t want anymore for you but charge you a fee to do so. Like if a subscription is $10/month they charge you $25 to cancel it, if you kept the subscription going for a year without cancelling it you essentially saved $95.  To me, even IF you need to cancel 5 subscriptions, that doesn’t take that long. The only use seems to be they allow you to cancel the subscriptions that are really annoying to cancel, like Planet Fitness/24H Fitness/other gym memberships that still keep billing you after you told them to cancel the subscription.  Granted I haven’t even used any of the apps, so I don’t even know if they do all the hard work into cancelling a Planet Fitness membership for you.",

So why do we say that our species are 200,000 years old instead of half a million years old. For further proof, even genetic analysis says that we split from Neanderthals 500,000 years ago?",
    "self_text": "The binomial name Homo sapiens was coined by Linnaeus, 1758. The Latin noun homō (genitive hominis) means \"human being\", while the participle sapiēns means \"discerning, wise, sensible\".  The species was initially thought to have emerged from a predecessor within the genus Homo around 315,000 (based on 2017 finding of early modern human in morocco) to 200,000 years ago.  A problem with the morphological classification of \"anatomically modern\" was that it would not have included certain extant populations. For this reason, a lineage-based (cladistic) definition of H. sapiens has been suggested, in which H. sapiens would by definition refer to the modern human lineage following the split from the Neanderthal lineage. Such a cladistic definition would extend the age of H. sapiens to over 500,000 years. Estimates for the split between the Homo sapiens line and combined Neanderthal/Denisovan line range from between 503,000 and 565,000 years ago between 550,000 and 765,000 years ago; and (based on rates of dental evolution) possibly more than 800,000 years ago.

    "self_text": "I’ve had the case since 2018. I’m upset to say this but recently, my phone’s case has been falling apart. At first I had noticed cracks near the top left curve of my phone and near the volume buttons. The top left had cracked and the crack has gone down to the back of the phone case not leaving the bend. The volume buttons have also cracked and split but haven’t gotten as far down as the top. More cracks have been forming on the right side of my case. Just now today, the power off button has started peeling off and is attached to a singular strand of rubber in the phone case. I’ve pushed it in and it’s holding on better but I’m afraid it will soon come off without notice. Just as my phone case, my charger has been dying too. Around a month ago, the white plastic at the end had cracked and had fallen off after 2 months of being that way. I had kept the pieces hoping to glue them back but one half was lost.  The other I still had but due to my hope being lost in finding the other half I had thrown the piece away. It had functioned great and hasn’t had any problems until now. The rubber has split open and the wire is becoming frayed. Minor problems have begun. I had checked my phone once to find out the charging had stopped at 80 perfect and the cable had been positioned improperly not letting power go thorough the split part. Although this has happened to me only once there was another minor issue. After my phone being on the charger for a while when using it, I randomly got an alert that said this accessory may not be compatible. It was a plain screen message that is similar to the low battery message. I clicked okay and the charging had stopped. I unplugged the cord and plugged it in once again and was relived after I saw it started to charge once again. I’ve had this apple genuine charging cable since around 2017 after my first one had suffered trauma with an incident involving a car door. The usb end of the cable was smashed by the car essory may not be compatible. It was a plain screen message that is similar to the low battery message. I clicked okay and the charging had stopped.

I’ve had this apple genuine charging cable since around 2017 after my first one had suffered trauma with an incident involving a car door. The usb end of the cable was smashed by the car door. I was very upset and ordered a new one right away which had served me well for these 5 years. The reason I am writing this out is because I am unsure what to do. My case and charger still functions as intended but I am not sure if I should purchase a new charger and case or if I should only purchase one of the two. My phone is not compatible with wireless charging, and I would not be able to use that as an option. My iPhone is a 7+ and I am stating this specifically so that the case size I am speaking of is known. If anyone would be able to help me in any way I would gratefully appreciate it.

    "self_text": "When I was in law school I had to take several “advocacy” classes.  They were basically public speaking classes where you got up in front of the class and had to speak.  A big part of it was the class and the professor criticizing your behavior during your presentation.  Things like “stop saying ummm so much it’s really annoying” or “stop fidgeting you look nervous and unsure” or “just hold your hands like this and don’t move them, whatever you’re doing is really weird”.  This would have been absolutely mortifying except for the fact that every single person in the class was subjected to it which made you realize that in the beginning everyone sucks at it and it’s just a skill to practice and learn.  I went from someone who would hyperventilate at the thought of public speaking to someone who is absolutely confident and enjoys speaking to large groups of people.  I see so many people on the Internet who are interesting, well “spoken” and insightful online who say that they are terrible at social interaction.  I met many people at work who came across as serial killers for a long time until I really got to know them.  I can tell that they realize they are terrible at social interaction but they don’t know what to do and have nowhere to go to learn and improve.      I feel bad for these people because if they were just made aware of a few quirks and had a chance to get feedback in a safe environment, practice and gain confidence they would be set for life.  One thing about social interaction, just like public speaking, is that once you get good at it it stays with you for life.  You only have to solve that problem once.  So with so many people having issues with social interaction why is it never taught at any school level? Why do schools have tutoring for every single subject except for what is one of the most vital skills to function IRL?",

    "self_text": "Hi,  I am renting a basement room currently for University and the land lord has a dog and cat upstairs. The dog seems to be urinating indoors more but it usually is on tiled flooring and they clean it up. However, a week ago the dog urinated in their upstairs living room, which did not have the tiled flooring and I guess they did not notice so it seeped through the older flooring and onto my area in the basement.  It landed right on top of my fridge (full size fridge with upper freezer) and the splashing of it dripping went onto my coffee maker. Its a fancy Keurig one. I opened the freezer and noticed the pee had pooled into a shelf on the door of the freezer, so I took it out and cleaned it.  I also cleaned up the coffee maker on the outside as well as repeatedly clean its reservoir with dish soap. I used a 99% bacterial disinfectant to wipe it first and the outside of the fridge/coffee maker. I didn't notice anything get inside of the coffee maker at least.  I am wondering if the food in the freezer and the coffee maker is now unusable due to the terrible bacteria and chemicals dog urine carries. I tried making just hot water in the coffee maker a bunch of times to see if it would smell or seem off, but it didn't.   If they are unusable then I need to talk to my landlord about compensating me for the coffee maker and replacing all the food inside my freezer.  The landlord helped me clean it up initially and I told her this is a huge health risk and I will not deal with repeated incidence. She said she would take precautions to keep this from happening again but I will have to wait and see about that. It's not easy for me to just get up and find a new place cause I am in the middle of school with midterms going on.",

It may need to be dumbed down because this question has nearly melted my brain.   Pretend that in that picture from the telescope, which is a picture of roughly 3 billion years ago due to the speed of light, is a giant mirror that reflects everything. That mirror has been there forever. If the telescope picked that mirror up, would you see the telescope, or would you have to wait 3-6billion years to see it?   On top of that, let’s say you had a telescope that could zoom into that mirror, to the point of being able to zoom INTO earth, would you be able to observe humans? And if so, would you see people from 3billion years ago?   Lastly, since our universe constantly moves, if you could view the mirror as a video, would the video of people moving be too fast to tell what is going on? And would the speed change?   Thank you",

On the opposite side of the spectrum, one might find things like  The Loud House.  The show has a tendency to have its main character, Lincoln, come up with a plan; shortly before executing it, he will state something along the lines of \"Okay! Operation\" [Insert extremely long and complicated name] And Also Think of a Shorter Name For This Operation\" is a go! This was also done similarly in Gumball at some point.  But--and this is assuming there's even a way to find out without being a spy--are real life spy operations titled like that? Furthermore, if they were, would they use a pun or rhyme, or would they make it short and simple to remember?

But somewhat less households than back in the 1990s decorate. It also appears its more of a competition to do so,  those who don't compete seems to not bother. But some households are super elaborate in decorations with all these lights, inflatables, and projectors. Also it appears in recent years trick or treating seems to be highly concentrated to some neighborhoods leaving others quite in the void.

If anyone has already put in the effort on this one, I would love to hear what you think.  Edit 1: Despite this book existing for a little over two months, it appears that nobody has actually read it, or that nobody who has read it has lived to tell the tale.  Edit 2: I'm certainly not going to read it. For all I know, it's cursed. If I die from a book written by a bunch of economists, I'm going to be pissed!",

    "self_text": "This is kinda urgent, I’ll try to brief it up as much as I can, I only realised the absolute tomfoolery that happened when I collected my certificates today.   I registered to sit 3 subjects in the May/June session 2021  with my school , namely English (A**), Biology (A*), and Business (C) (I’m not mentioning the grades to flex their mediocrity, I’m just contemplating retaking them if I can, and I think my older performance is worth noting when compared to my most recent).   When the school asked me to fill the form for registration, dad told me to: write my surname  correctly , because it was spelt incorrectly on my passport and he was planning on updating our passports anyway and fixing the spelling. Let’s say my surname was written ‘xyez’ when it’s supposed to be ‘xyz’. So my school allowed me to make that alteration for some reason, and my certificate was issued with the name ‘abc lmnop xyz’.   In 2022 I sat 2 subjects, ICT (A*) and Accounting (B), though I registered through the  british council  this time, not my school, so while inputting my details, the bc asked if I had sat a session with them earlier, to match my candidate name if that was the case, but I hadn’t, so I obviously said so, then I was asked to match my details to my  passport , and my passport  still  said ‘xyez’ because dad never updated it. I felt forced to keep the spelling accurate because I knew that I wouldn’t be allowed into the venue if my statement of entry didn’t match my passport details. I received the certificate for this session today, and it says ‘abc xyez’ ONLY. So not only is my surname spelt different to the way it was on my older certificate, my middle name isn’t present. As far as I’m aware, unis in Egypt won’t recognise the exams as taken by the same individual if the name on the certificate doesn’t match.   I am (or were) to sit 3 subjects for the 2023 May/June session, because Egypt requires a minimum of 8 OL’s. But now I’m contemplating sitting 3 more subjects  (in case they really won’t consider the first certificate where my name doesn’t match the passport) alongside the 3 I’m studying currently (History, French foreign language and Human bio) but 6 subjects in one session, especially this late of a decision, would be an awful load of work and I’m afraid I’m going to perform awfully.   Any advice or insight on what can I do in such situation to fix this dilemma?",

Why did it used to be like this and how did it change so suddenly? It changed with the Famicom in 83 but in the same year there was still the \"Gakken Compact Vision TV Boy\" so there must have been some shift around 83 that got the weird names to stop?

That made me think of other Pokemon knock offs. They all try to use their own system and the same issue occurs. A few things I could maybe understand but the first gen types seem all really basic. Maybe you could change a few around just to skirt under the law if absolutely necessary.  I know Nintendo is pretty strict and very happy to crack down on anything similar or that they own. The type system seems so basic I can’t imagine they would have such a major issue with other games copying it to a degree.

    "self_text": "So I just started working at this grocery store. Today at the end of the day a very loud alarm started to sound, and a light started to flash. I went to go investigate and it was the “refrigeration alarm“.  There was a little piece of paper under the alarm that said that the alarm with sound until you pressed a button to silence it. So I pressed the button to silence it because it was ear deafening. The light continue to flash. I went and told the manager and she had to call someone who works at the company that made the refrigeration system.  From what I gathered it seems that the alarm must go off if the temperature drops below a certain degree in the refrigerators. It’s such a serious alarm though. It sounds like there’s going to be a tornado or something and it’s very very loud.   I never knew things like this existed.  OK so my question is:  why would a refrigerator need an alarm? Why couldn’t have just a casual blinking light or a notice at the front of the store? Why is the alarm so scary sounding? Is it something serious? Could something literally explode?   Does my fridge at home have a refrigeration alarm as well? Lol",

And Christian nationalists treating the nation as being a Christian nation (when it's not) or as though it should be or should only be Christian nation?

But are there country combinations that have never \"interacted\" on this kind of basis whatsoever just because they... never needed to, or ever considered it, or something? Now, I don't have any geopolitical savvy (could you guess?) but I'm obviously wondering about interactions more protracted and comprehensive than, \"they have representatives that show up at the UN so yeah idiot they all technically have a relationship.\"   Put it this way: if I hit a random country generator twice, would it be possible to land on two countries that have never shared any kind of historical relationship on a political/economic/diplomatic level? You'd have to think so, with 195 countries (blame Google if that's inaccurate) and therefore over 18,000 potential 1-to-1 combinations (blame Google again if that's also inaccurate).",

    "self_text": "I work in retail and a customer was asking a question about a specific item. I gave her some incorrect information. I was pretty sure about what I was saying, but it turned out to be wrong. I basically said an item she was looking for didn't exist, when it fact it did. With what I knew at the moment, I was sure I was right, but it turns out I was wrong. She came back to me and said she found it and I said it must have been misplaced. She then said \"You don't know\" and said that she'll ask someone else.   I eventually had a manager go up to me some time later and asked how I'm doing and how long I've been here. She was all friendly, but it was entirely obvious as to why she asking. It's because that customer made a complaint about me. It was enough of a complaint that she identified me, hence the manager finding me.   I was then asked to work with someone else the next time I come in.   To be fair, it's my second day working with customers, and it's my first job.   I was so upset by this. A was just talking to a colleague as a little catch up and I mentioned this and I was about to cry. I still feel really upset and I just can't get over it. It's completely stuck in my head and I just feel terrible.   I started around 4 days ago (2 days I didn't work with customers because I was assigned to other duties.) and every night I can only sleep for 4 hours. I don't know why. It's probably some sort of subconscious stress.  &#x200B;   Why do I feel like this? Why am I so upset?    Thank you.",

It almost looks like pure wasted energy when they could just find a branch and sit until everyone arrives.  What is the purpose of this behavior? My best guess is maybe it helps them count each other to know everyone is there.

    "self_text": "This is something I've noticed particularly in live broadcasts of political speeches recently (such as Biden's speech last night, or his State of the Union address). The ASL interpreters shown to the side of the person speaking are often making very exaggerated, almost theatrical looking faces as they are signing the speech. What purpose does this serve?  In contrast, in some older white house recordings, the interpreter looks more tone-neutral, which is more what I would expect as a hearing person in a live translation of any language.  Based on my very limited knowledge of ASL, facial expressions are not part of the language, but can be used to convey emotional context, sarcasm, attitude, and other things we would use tone for in spoken language. However, in these broadcasts it often seems to me like the interpreter is adding a lot *more* tone and emotion than is actually present in the original speech, which strikes me as unprofessional.  Usually when I hear an English dub of a foreign language speech or news broadcast, for example, the professional standard is to translate it fairly literally and without much emotional affect, even if the original speaker was more impassioned. It'd be pretty weird for the person dubbing Xi Jinping's speech in English for the international broadcast to add in a bunch of emotional flair that wasn't actually in the original; it distracts from the content rather than adding to it.  So is this added flair \"normal\" for ASL interpretation? And if so, why?",

When writing sentences, the writer says things like \"they are.\" Shouldn't we change that to \"they is\" like \"he/she is\"? I know that sounds weird, but you are just talking about one person and not a group, so it should not be treated as a plural pronoun. It definitely sounds weird and would probably never be adopted, but technically should this be how sentences are structured around these pronouns?",

    "self_text": "Many relationships start out healthy, vibrant. Over a period of time, months or years, the relationship slowly devolves into arguments. Which I suppose is still fine, because what relationship doesn’t have arguments?  Then something happens. And poof, it becomes not an argument ever once in a while, but an argument in every conversation. Even non-important small details begin to spark arguments. Both people stop talking to each other because talking means more arguments. Then naturally, they grow apart and seek happiness elsewhere.   That’s the often too common devolution of healthy relationships. But the question is why does this happen? Two fairly reasonable people who are attracted to each other end up not being able to stand each other? Why does it happen and can it be prevented or is it just the relationship taking its natural course?",

The problem is, the only areas that would work for us all would end up with me having a ~50 min commute every day to work. Looking at available listings in the area that my new job is in (a little rural), I've found that basically all of them would entail living with people (who are older) who own the house themselves and are looking for roommates to fill up an extra room. After a couple of bad experience during my college years, I'm not that keen on putting myself in back in a situation where there's a bit of a power imbalance within the household. My ideal living situation would be with a few other people in my age group/stage in life (such as with my friends). I work a 4 day week with 1-in-4 weekend shifts, but the shifts are about 10-12 hours long depending on if I have to do overtime. So, my main concern is that the commute is going to drain me and that the extra costs associated with driving just wouldn't justify me living with my friends. Not sure if I should just suck it up and take the logical, money saving route, or take the risk and live with my friends (the thought of which makes me a lot happier).",

    "self_text": "Like I’m not trying to sound stupid but I don’t understand why health insurance companies exists? Why is there a need for a middle man between a patient and a doctor? Can doctors choose not to work for an insurance and instead opt for running their own business with their own prices for patients? And for example, say that doctor chose to price their appointments at a reasonable price? Could they also get medical equipment outside of an insurance? It’s so weird, how much do people spend in health insurance? What if they give that money to the doctors instead? Couldn’t the doctors use it for better?  I don’t understand where do patients and health providers benefit from an insurance?? it just seems like all the insurance does is get patients to the doctors so that the doctors can make money and then the insurance keeps the majority of the money they charged.",

Plus, I made a financial mess when I was pursuing that career and would like to recover from it.  Despite these two given choices (full-time and part-time), the cons of these two really bothered me.   If I take full-time job, I won't be able to enjoy much time with my hobby like before.  If I take part-time job, I might only be paid less due to hourly rate.   It's uncertain how much I'll be paid once I got the job on one of these options but I'm currently deciding which one will benefit me without putting my health in danger and abandon the things I love to do during my past career.

    "self_text": "I only ask because when I was younger I didn’t experience it. Perhaps it’s new with becoming an adult? Anyways, I’ll wake up one day, and feel energized, I’ll feel like nothing can strike me down. Full of confidence I’ll be really productive as well, cleaning, doing schoolwork, being super friendly at work and such. Basically I just feel on top of the world. But then, it can be in the middle of something completely mundane, it’ll feel like someone flushed a toilet, and all those positive feelings just swirl down the pipes. Genuinely, feels like that in my head. I can feel the confidence and energization and associated feelings essentially rushing down the drain as the pendulum swings to the other side. Then, generally for much longer, I’ll be so much more abrasive. What is worse is I am aware of it, but it’s incredibly difficult to try and be smiley/positive when it switches to a low. (I only say low to differentiate). It’s incredibly tiring not knowing how I am going to feel at a given moment, and how rapidly my mind decides to change. I feel as if my brain is working on its own, and no matter if I’m doing something I enjoy, it still sometimes just flushes the dopamine and serotonin down the drain and I feel shitty for days on end, sometimes weeks. I’m struggling to manage it, but I make sure to never lash out at other people, and try to remain courteous no matter how I’m feeling. However, I recognize when I feel low, I am much more intense or snappy. For small things, I’ll get disproportionately ‘excited’, for lack of a better term. Is it normal, or will it mellow out after some time?",

But it’s getting colder now so obviously they don’t WANT to go outside to do their business but they have to cause they can’t go in the house. But the last couple of days it’s been raining and dog 3 hasn’t been going, and then I’ll find a “surprise” somewhere in the house a couple minuets after letting them back in.  Just today I stood outside with just dog 3 and repeatedly told her to “go outside” which they know means go to the bathroom outside. But she just stood there shivering and stared at me. For like 5 minuets. And when we went back in, I went to the bathroom for a minuet and when I came back out she’d done it inside!!  Most problems with dogs pooping in the house are because the owners won’t let them out or aren’t vigilant enough for when they do need to go out, but, what do I do if my dogs just being a little shit who doesn’t wanna go outside and poop only when it’s cold and raining?? Everywhere I look online tells me I’m the problem for not letting them out enough but I d o she’s just a little r a t.  All 3 of them are 11 years old as well so it’s not like they don’t know how to go outside. 2 and 3 can sit on command, 1 won’t because idk she doesn’t want to.

The only outcomes are \"did it\" or \"didn't do it\".  I am not going to be able to do most things the first time. But \"do not\" seems like such a failure. Why would you want to sit in \"do not\" for so long before it's perfect and you can say \"I did it!\"?  I have never made an entire scarf without making a single mistake in a stitch. So can I really not say that I have ever knitted? I really feel like I should be able to claim that I try to knit, even if it isn't perfect. But no, Yoda says there IS no try.

    "self_text": "I work from home, so I have limited social interactions. I’ve tried joining different clubs and dating apps as a way to meet people but it’s pretty dry.  My question is: what are some strategies I can implement to deal with the nerves of wanting to approach a woman ?  I see pretty girls at the gym, but don’t approach them because according to some people, it’s creepy or weird. Although at the same time, I see guys randomly approach girls at the gym and it’s welcomed.   I’m about 5’11, 145lbs, I consider myself to be attractive. I recognize this is likely a confidence issue.   If I’ve met a girl and we’re on a date, all is well, no awkwardness or nervousness. It’s the idea of approaching a stranger that gives me anxiety.   Any advice, tips or experiences you all can share would be appreciated.",

But then when I explain that to people who call out these things as lazy, they refuse to budge on their opinion. But then they also don't see using a lighter instead of building a fire to light their cigarette as lazy. Using an electric kettle instead of boiling water over a stove to be lazy.

    "title": "Confusion In My Life?",
    "self_text": "Hey, all of my life I have been told that I just wasn't doing  enough *.* When I was growing up, this really had an affect on me because it had been drilled into my mind at like 6 years old that I wasn't normal, I was just a fat ass kid, and it seemed like everything I did was just wrong. I mean as a kid, I wasn't even that fat. I know that I was not skinny but just had a little more body fat. Looking back at pictures from when I was a kid shocks me all the time. Because honestly the kid in the pictures doesn't even look that big, but I know that that was constantly on my mind because of family. Compared to what I am now (256lbs but was 280lbs a couple months ago) I would love to look like how I did physically as a kid.   The point I'm trying to make is, I (20M) now after so many years don't feel like I'm just a waste of oxygen. I'm certainly not what you would call \"happy\" but I'm also kind of just chilling. Like I'm not sad, mad, disappointed, happy, etc. I'm just doing  decent.  So in my mind, I think that I'm doing pretty good and making progress with my life. I dropped out of college my freshman year last year, but I returned and have A's in all of my classes as of right now. When I was in high school, I despised the idea of even going to college. So to see that progress now man, it make me proud.   So then why does it feel though like its not enough? Don't get me wrong, when I look back and evaluate what I'm  actually  doing it gives me peace and stability. But when I open up literally any social media, I'm told that I have to basically learn how to solve world hunger in order to be a \"man\" and to have a fulfilling life. I know social media isn't reality, but these videos plague all of  my feeds and I see one at least twice a day. It sucks because it feels like its putting me in that same position from when I was a kid. It's just so confusing man.   Am I doing enough? Or am I just a loser that's inevitably going to meet his doom? I don't know, I get mixed messages every single day. I, personally, don't feel like I'm just a person who's taking up space. I think I'm doing okay for someone my age. Not the best of course, but I'm also not doing the worst. Social media will really have me believe that I am really the bottom of the barrel in terms of society. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk, I would love to hear feedback from someone that would have an objective standpoint on my situation.  tldr: I am pretty okay with where I am at in life right now, and am doing things that are positively impactful. But I constantly question if I'm really doing okay due to social media, friends, family etc. I am just confused.",

    "self_text": "I 24F have parents 44 & 45 who are now possibly facing scary consequences as I am hoping don’t come up. I have a 2 month old new born baby girl who is my parent first grand baby as she is my first child she was born a premie. 2 weeks prior to her being born we spoke to my parents and my in laws regarding boundaries are number one was DO NOT KISS HER ON THE FACE as germs, RSV, COVID, etc are a big scary thing to happen to babies. Well we obviously didn’t know my baby was going to come out premature she hasn’t received her shots neither as she has her appointment in a couple of weeks. Well last weekend I saw my dad kiss her on the face & I told him to please not kiss her on the face, same thing with my mom the Friday that just recently passed do not kiss her on the face & she stated she forgot. Well yesterday Saturday I asked my parents if they can watch her for 2 hours while I went to dinner with my little brother just to catch up well lately I have been arguing with my mom as sometimes she tries to push me away when it comes to my baby for example if she’s crying and I’m trying to calm her down she grabs her and makes comments saying “being frustrated is only going to make it worst” when I was no where near frustrated mind you I’m going through PPD so hearing comments like that only make me feel worst. Well as stated yesterday I had to tell them again do not kiss her face idk how many times I have to tell you please respect it they brushed it off well my dad is positive on covid and my mom has a cough, runny nose & chills. My baby seems fine & im hoping she stays that way but I’m angry I’m angry they couldn’t respect my boundaries & now my baby is at risk & my parents told me to not be upset as it’s their grand baby & they just can’t help it. AITA?   Edit: my mom helps me babysit her when I have therapy but during those days is where we have been a bit going back and forth",

You can see a name of a person that liked you and sometimes the names change so I know mulitple names but they haven't shown up to my feed. How do I fix this because it has to be something with Tinder because I used to get likes before?

I think the whole problem can't be really divided into \"black and white\", as it is much more complicated. So I just have to ask here.  Does pro life mean, that a woman has to carry out a child no matter what, once she is pregnant? Wether or not she was raped, is still a child herself or has medical problems with the pregnancy?  Does pro choice mean a woman can choose to have her child aborted whenever she wants? Even 7 months into pregnancy, when the child is pretty much fully developed and could even survive, if it was born via c-section for example?   Honestly both options sound absolutely horrible. Can I still consider myself to be pro-choice, as long as there are some boundaries? For example that abortion should only be allowed when the pregnancy is under 3 months or when there are serious health concerns for mother or child?",

No water falling anywhere else around. Just these specific 4 trees. I took a (admittedly terrible due to the night time darkness) video, there was a pickup parked underneath that you could see and hear the drops hitting.   These trees were expelling water from their leaves at a paranormal rate. I vaguely remember hearing in school that some trees do this to avoid freezing and dying?

    "self_text": "Understanding that this obviously very hypothetical and unrealistic... But let's say some well-connected individual(s) hired a team to do a movie-like secret extraction and get BG out of her Russian prison-- But the US government had nothing to do with it all. Once she's back in the USA \"safe and sound,\" if the Kremlin demanded her return, what would be the realistic legal response and implications?  The US has publicly stated many times that BG is being wrongfully detained... And while they're in \"negotiations\" for her freedom, it's not looking likely at the time being. So if some billionaire with the connections to do such a thing pulled it off through a series of bribes, espionage, and impeccable planning (and a bunch of luck), what are the odds that the US is able to say \"Ah, tough shit\" to Putin and be willing to deal with the political fallout?  Would the US really entertain sending her back to avoid relations with the Kremlin going even further south?? I'd like to think they wouldn't, but I'm not totally sure.  I understand that there are other citizens locked up overseas under similar sketchy circumstances, but given that BG is a celebrity and her celebrity status is key component to the way Russia is handling her, this specific scenario is with her situation in mind.

Though I wanted to be like everyone else, I also wasn't really willing to make the necessary changes to be so.   Besides my own story, I can see this being a good or at least \"okay\" goal because it's human nature to want to fit in with people. And if you're genuinely a really weird or unlikable person or whatever, it's natural to wanna change those traits to more closely fit in with society.   But I can also see this being a bad goal because it could be disingenuous to your true self, and it's generally not a good idea to throw yourself away just to fit in.   Overall, I personally think it can be a decent goal as long as not taken too literally. Like sure, learn to better communicate and fit in with people, but don't completely throw away your hobbies and interests just to fit in.",

Any time I visit them or the other members of the family, I am always encouraged to participate in their religious activities, but \"I'm sorry, I'm a bit too shy for that\" is only going so far.  Multiple times I have received highly religious novels, and they tend to want my feedback on them, but sometimes it's a bit hard to stomach the content. My dear spouse has turned non-religious in recent years but hides it on their own accord, so I feel as though I'm not alone in that way.  While the family I grew up with is also religious, they have experienced enough difficulty where they don't care if the younger generation is religious, as pong as they are kind and well-meaning.  Unfortunately, do to my physical location, I would need to purchase plane tickets to visit my family, on top of a several hour road trip.  Really, I feel like an outcast with my one, wonderful anchor.  Anyway, tl;dr do we think it's feasible to tell the in-laws I am non-religious?",

We also are aware that \"midget\" is an offensive term but thought it only referred to dwarfism and don't know where it originated.   Obviously I would NEVER call someone a midget IRL because I know it's wrong but I'm not quite sure why.  If I was born with the condition I would most likely want to be called a dwarf or midget, but 'little person' seems to devalue the person's worth instead of describing their physical size?

Does business sense require you to carefully capitalise on consumer demands for status/power, and cleverly associate normal products with brand identity and add in extra useless features in your product but still somehow get people to pay for them?  Same goes for businesses that play with your insecurities as in \"buy this book about masculinity to get girls in 3 weeks\" or \"buy this protein shake and get jacked in 2 months\" when the average buyer obviously knows these are false claims but these statements target a smaller and more vulnerable section of society and make money that way.

    "self_text": "I'm asking this as I'm insecure about my hygiene and how others think of me based on it, pretty much I shower enough, am very conscious of touching things that are dirty, yet I still find people making comments about my hygiene, I wondered how it's possible that people can find something wrong with my hygiene and whether it's genetic that I don't always smell/look/ even feel hygienic personally or feel hygienic physically? Will be a big help if anyone knows why. Edit: I meant if one showers completely then goes outside 5 minutes later and see's someone and they say their unhygienic, obviously if one runs about which I do do alot they can get sweaty but if you're \"clean\" from a shower and don't do any exercise/ manage to make yourself dirty again surely you should be 99% fresh as a dove.

I do know that once you sell something over a certain value now, you need to pay a certain percentage of that value if I understand correctly.   What I don't understand is how that applies to certain items. There are things I was given as a gift that are valued at more than $600. Does that mean the government is just free to extract value from things that I was given?  There are also things that I bought for say $50 or $20 but are now worth $1,000 or so. If I were to sell those things, do I have to declare the value as what they sell for, or are they still only valued at what I bought them for? I don't think it seems fair that I would have to pay a percentage of the sale of something that I would be profiting on otherwise.   Most things that I have that are worth more than $600 we're not worth $600 when I bought them.   These are things that I bought specifically because they were cheap with the intention of selling, so now I feel like I'm trapped not selling them to avoid paying that percentage in taxes and taking too big of a hit that the sale won't be worth it.

Decrying something as “illegal” doesn’t mean anything without consequences (which I’m uneducated if there are any). If there are I don’t see how organizing a strike isn’t protected first amendment free speech. Also I don’t see 120k workers, many in specialized fields, being easily replaceable. It seems to me they have the ultimate leverage because a work stoppage would essentially grind the entire economy to a snails pace. In my mind this all seems like a giant bluff by the government.

I live in a house with 5 women, and my period has never synced up to someone else’s. Granted, mine is always irregular and sometimes it just happens to cross paths, but that’s coincidental.  I always thought it was a fake idea, but I haven’t found anything disproving it and most women treat it like fact. So, do periods actually sync up with other women? If so, how does that work?

Graph 2 is always 100 (y=100). Simplified, I'm saying Graph 1 is stars and 2 is trees. It's assuming the number of trees doesn't change enough to be significant.  &#x200B;  Let's say we're at the period where Graph 1 is at 7. You wouldn't say that Graph 1 is bigger just because it's always increasing, right? Even though it's going to 8, 9, 10, etc. it's still smaller because 8 <100, 9 < 100, 10 < 100, etc.",

I also struggle with partial vision loss that is severe enough that I can't drive, which means I will likely run into a few perplexed people during the trip.

    "self_text": "I saw a video of no-neck Big Ed putting on a helmet w/ chin strap and the chin strap was constantly a centimeter from slipping right up his face without a chin to hang onto.  Then, I was reminded of a different person who had subdermal implants all over his scalp and face that prevented him from wearing a helmet altogether. This guy was told he could no longer ride his motorcycle because it was illegal for him to ride without properly wearing a helmet.  So, this got me thinking. Are people who naturally, anatomically cannot properly secure a helmet to their head just screwed and cannot legally ride motorbikes / cycles? It's not like it's their fault that they've got no chin for the chin strap lol. Thoughts?",

I tried looking online but I can't find anything that states a correlation to feeling sleepy and  hunger outside of just feeling fatigued, which is not really how I feel. I also looked up symptoms of diabetes and I don't think I have any.  Is this a normal thing that happens when you don't eat for an extended period of time?

    "self_text": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/951w28/world_map_of_tradition_of_removing_shoes_in_home/  It appears this topic not as black and white or blue and green for this matter. A good topic for anyone planning to become a delivery rider at or relocate to such a region to avoid culture flux or conflict.  I heard some I.e ASEAN, Korea, Japan any street footwear past threshold is never acceptable except unfinished/destoyed interiors or other extreme examples that almost don't happen to most people i.e already ruined by fire or mud, warzone, etc. Not even for movies and TV. So don't even try to skip out.  But for others while its customery rule it seem to be much more lax on the rule/custom in practice. Same can be said about those coming in to do or train on exercise i.e ball, workout, or skater boarding without trucks on carpets, or help move stuff. Some households don't care.   In your culture given its normally customery to remove shoes at the door if invited past threshold when its acceptable to make exceptions:   Is it assumed one can skip out on removing shoes if unexpectantly invited in while delivering unless asked otherwise, oftentimes the \"cute\" pizza or food delivery gal/guy might simply overlook his or her sneakers on their feet at that moment if invited past the shoe area and the resident loathe to remind them(almost happened when i delivered once). Thus households that are sensitive about this(i.e tatami on the floor) should beware? Same goes for those invited doing other activities I listed above i.e a personal trainer?  Or only if host/resident specifically insist they keep them on which is about 50% of the time, but never ever do so without expressed consent first, leaving them on around the \"foyer\" area may be acceptable though? Indoor only shoes can be allowed but be first declared to the resident.   Or its only in movies and Tv its ever acceptable in said country, It may still be acceptable if its on a film, or tv set, or part of a show. Apparently some places in the world are shoes off irl but mostly shoes on the screen.",

During class, my professor explained that the total value of the resistance in parallel circuits is less than the value of each resistor's resistance separately.  Thus far in the class everything has generally made sense to me, but this made my brain come to a complete stop. How could multiple instruments that create resistance, when factored for collectively, create less resistance than their singular resistor value? I understood how to calculate the math fine, and the professor answered the theoretical side of the math needing to work that way well for the theory to make sense, but I'm asking -  what is actually happening in a parallel circuit which is causing the overall resistance to be smaller than the individual resistors? What does that look like?",

I have a particular non-urgent but ever deteroiting condition in my eye which needs surgery. I have started with the optometry(2 month waiting during full covid season) then another one and at last I eneded up with an opthalmologist after 1.5 yr of struggle to meet one and then he refered me to the right doctor for this surgery which had 6 months waiting that too got cancelled 3 months later. Now I moved to mid west and the doctor;s office here forced me to go over the same process because they need referal and luckily because of someone's cancellation I could see a non surgery opthamologist who's main job was to create my referal again. Now I am sitting for my appointment 7 months and only God knows how long for the actual surgery.",

    "self_text": "Many of us have heard that billionaires often pay very little in income tax because most of their worth is in equity, and capital gains in equity aren't taxable in the U.S. Additionally, many billionaires finance their lifestyle by taking out personal loans rather than selling their stock and getting taxed on it. Much of their worth can also be spread through various shell companies, which all have their own individual tax returns. That means that Elon Musk, the wealthiest U.S. citizen, likely does not pay anywhere near the most taxes in the country. So my question is, who was most likely to have the largest  personal  tax return in the United States?",

With how many painkillers some people need to live, it seems odd to me that we would evolve to even have the capacity for that amount of pain - like a sort of self-sabotage. And also, why does pain not 'just hurt'? Why does it have to feel like mental trauma? Wouldn't it be cool if you could feel pain but be sort of indifferent to it if you opted to be so?

    "self_text": "My parents own a lake house they go to on weekends. I 25f came up by myself today. The door was left wide open and unlocked when i got here. I felt weird about that but checked the whole house while on the phone.   Aftwr turning on the water and water heater, i locked the basement door because i was weirded out. I just woke up at 3am to lrt the dogs with me outside to pee. I cam back in and washed my own hands after going to the bathroom. The water pressure seemed turned off. I unloxked the basement door to go downstairs and there were bags on the stairs that weren't there earlier. Part of me thought that maybe someone was down there and turned the water off while i was outside to lure me down and hadn't realized they knocked the bags down when checking the door. But things fall and i might have not turned the water on properly. Could i call police to check my house or am i paranoid?  EDIT/UPDATE:  thanks everyone for the responses. I realized that i never turned on the well pump so the theory that i had that someone turned off the water to lure me downstairs doesn't work anymore. I realize i have the bedroom above the stairs and we keep the bags on a shelf above the stairs. Moving arouns my room probably caused the bags to fall. I never checked the basement but i feel mostly confident im alone now. I still made sure the basement was locked and placed a  a few champagne glasses in front of the door so they'll shatter and wake me and the dogs up if the door opens. I'll call a neighbor to help check the house in the morning if im still worried. And i locked my room door and i have 2 dogs in bed with me. They won't protect me but one of them would work as an alarm. 1 is a chihuahua who is afraid of the edge of the bed and the other is too old to walk and is basically blind and deaf now. But the chihuahua would bark if she heard someone.",

    "self_text": "To start out, some backstory—not for sympathy points, but for context. I’m going to be vague about some details as I don’t want my parents/peers to see this and ask me about it.   I (F18) grew up with two very different parents: a liberal woman with a best friend who is black, and a closet racist with a not-so-closeted drinking problem. My mother lived in a liberal state in New England, my father a majority-red state that isn’t  quite  Southern. I spent my childhood moving between the two states.   Growing up, I knew racism was wrong. I went to a school in a pretty diverse city, and spent the majority of my childhood with my mother in N.E. I interacted with black people on a regular basis, knew many black people who I consider be family, and generally had an understanding that racist people were shitty, horrible and wrong. There were incidents in my childhood where my father got intoxicated and would say some vile and abhorrent stuff about our neighbors, who were black, and I remember being shocked and upset then.   At the beginning of my 6th Grade year, I moved from N.E. to where my Dad lived. I very quickly retreated into online communities and fandom, both because I was getting to the age where you go online but also because I was lonely. At first it was just having a fan account about the music that I liked and making online friends. But after a year or so I made friends who were into saying incredibly racist and shitty things for shock value and attention. As my mental health worsened and I spent more and more time online, I would have FaceTime calls where my friends and I would just make racist jokes repeatedly or make awful jokes about owning slaves. I would use the n-word as part of my daily vernacular, much to the disdain of my IRL friends. I  lost  friends over it—at one point, a friend had her black relative text me and threaten me. At the time I was incredibly angry and threatened to call the cops, but now… well, I realize they were just trying to scare me into stopping.   I don’t know why I thought any of that stuff was funny, or okay to say. It makes me feel sick now. I don’t know why I thought making jokes about slavery, about black people being harmed, was in any way amusing, or something that could be funny to anyone other than a racist.   I feel ashamed interacting with black people to this day, and I genuinely don’t know if I should try to form relationships with them or not—all I can think is, if this person knew about my past behavior, would they want to interact with me? Should I tell them about it? Is there any way that I can really undo the harm that I did, both to people online that I was cruel to and people I knew in real life? How should I move through the world now, having said so much harmful stuff?",

The tired words \"its allways been a dream for me to join the military\". I am sure most of you have read or heard this sentence multiple time throughout you current life. The criticism towards the person stating this sentence is usually something similar to \"You have no clue what your getting yourself into\", \"You are overestimating or underestimating your value, fitness, mentality, health, capability etc\".   I have background of playing elit football (Soccer), I have never hade any health issues, no allergies, no medicine.Taken antibiotics twice in my life. Born and raised vegetarian in the country side but today my main diet is meat. My length is 190 cm (6,2 feet) my weight is 80 kilos. Been homeless without food back in the day, without a father and mother who is both sick and addicted to weed.   The problem I need advice on, adding the factors of where I believe my current national country, culture and society is heading. The challenges the west and Europe is facing today and the future makes this a difficult discussion and self-reflection to be held.   I have come to the conclusion that I wouldn't want to fight and defend my home nation. The current state of affair is not worth defending. There is a lot of reasons, mainly social and political motives.  Without getting too political, is there any suggestions on a country I can move to? A place where I can feel like a citizen even if I am a white male. Celebrate my traditions and my culture in my house, No need to do it publicaly because its not my national country. Opportunity for education and work. The country have the mentality to survive, defend itself and accept me into their ranks.   I am willing to sacrifice my life for that country that would give me this opportunity.   At first hand, The US would be a reasonable choice for me. Problem is that it takes ages to become a citizen, I also believe the political situation in the US is dangerous. Social and political problems are destabilizing the US national security, dividing the population and their is no unifying force to deal with the problems.   Is there a country that would let me join their military? Educate me and the possibilitie to find home where I can work, eat and have a family. It can be either a democracy or authoritarian society. I don't mind.   Nations of interest: Ranked from top to bottom.    Israel   Saudi Arabia   Chile   Switzerland   France   Argentina   Turkey    All suggestions are appreciated, especially if you can let me know if there is a military that dosent state a law against foreigners joining their ranks.",

I tried two more times and it failed. My dad paid for it thankfully but it was $160. I felt awful about bc I intended to cover the entire cost.   So when I went to the store today to buy food, I brought my debit card, thinking it would maybe work. Nope, my bank was still closed for the holidays (which I understand). But when I went to test an Amazon order for needed work shoes, it went through without a problem.   So am I just being paranoid about the physical card transactions not working but online orders are?  Should I ask them to send a new card if it has these issues again tomorrow when I go attempt to buy food again? Any advice is greatly appreciated",

By the time we realized she was pregnant (approx. 2 months in), her previous owner had already ghosted, so I’ve been dealing with it all by myself.  In the few months since they’ve been born, I’ve taken them to numerous vet visits, I’ve gotten them special kitten foods, countless different medications, toys, etc.  It’s been months now, and no shelters are available to take them in my area. The ones that claim to be able to take the kittens in insist on them being given their shots first.  The doctors, on the other hand, say that they can’t be given their shots until they aren’t sick anymore.  I’ve just been stuck in a loop of buying them more medicine, and taking them back to the vet, and vice versa for weeks now.  I’ve done my best, and I’ve given them everything I possibly can, but I can’t financially shoulder it anymore. I’m a broke college student. I need to pay rent, I need to pay for textbooks, I can’t afford to feed 6 mouths.  Would it be a dick move to just put them all in a box and drop them off in front of the shelter anyways? I’m running out of options, I need to eat too. Any suggestions are welcome, thanks.",

(old battery was also 6v and it came, as well as charger, with the car as a package so i believe that's fine)?  Can something bad happen if i charge it for too long? Lets say overnight?",

I'm a 22M and I've been having this debate with myself lately about body counts and how a person with high body count would cheat. Now, I don't mean to be disrespectful here at all. I genuinely come here with a question because I am dumb.   After looking at today's dating life and how some people think it's \"normal\" to cheat in a relationship just because we're young makes me sick. Also, from what I've seen among my female and male friends is that the people with higher body counts are the only ones cheating as well. I for one am not in any relationship because I'm just not interested at all, but looking at what's happening outside makes me worried because when I would be looking for a partner, it would be hard finding one because you don't know when you'll be cheated on. So, am I wrong for thinking that having more bodies will make you potentially more prone to cheat on your partner?",

The buttons would be tactile switches embedded below the surface of the paper card which would provide tactile feedback when pressed.

Each card would have one game or two, and would be rechargeable. For example: a card could have PAC Man and Mrs PAC Man, or Galaga and Mappy for example.

But the majority of things I thought you were a wimp if you went to the doctor.   I also thought you were a wimp if you took care of minor injuries. Like if your knee hurt so you took the elevator, I thought that was weak. Or taking a sick day when you weren’t dying or something. I took pride in how I would keep pushing past my limits.   Now I’m 27 and I know that was dumb.   I’m in the process of learning that it’s ok to take a sick day if you’re too sick. It’s ok to stop your workout if you’re in bad pain. It’s ok to take the elevator if you hurt your knee.   I’m in therapy working on the underlying mental nonsense behind being mean to myself like that.

Just titling it fiction doesn't seem right to me (although I could be wrong).  Any suggestions?  Edit: There seems to be a bit of confusion about what i'm asking.

    "self_text": "For many reasons I am extremely picky with what I eat and always have been. My whole life my family has tried to encourage me to like at least throw some veggies on top of my meals or add a salad on the side of what I eat. For example I love Shanghai noodles but I usually eat around most of the vegetables in it because in my mind I figure it's not like the green onions and carrots are going to cancel out the fact that I'm eating a big bowl of noodles, and i don't like the texture of it all mixed together. This applies to any sort of meal I eat that would come with vegetables by default.  Am I wrong? Is it genuinely worth it in the long run to force myself to eat all the extra veggies that are mixed into my food? Changing my eating habits as a whole is not on the table right now but if it actually would be better for me I could try to make myself eat the vegetables id usually eat around in my meals. I feel like the obvious answer is 'yes vegetables are good for you' but 1. There are no stupid questions ok </3 and 2. It just feels like vegetables covered in noodle sauce doesn't have the same nutritional benefit as regular vegetables, so it feels like it doesn't really matter if I eat it or not. I am willing to change my ways if I'm actually thinking about this all wrong.",

    "self_text": "Yeah so basically I was on my phone and I guess I wanted to send a meme or something to somebody. And I found a picture that was just whiteness, and a video of the same thing with grey lines moving over it that kind of look like the shadow of a cieling fan's blades. So, first of all, I thought initially that it was a picture that wasn't loading. But if you zoom into the picture, it clearly has some texture to it, so it's a picture of  something .  I then thought maybe it was a picture of my ~roof~ ceiling, and that the grey lines were the shadow of my fan blades and that I had accidentally taken the picture.  But then I had the idea to check the timestamp. I have a Google Pixel 6 and on it, you can check info on a file and see what time it was created. It said 1:03pm. But this is impossible, because I was at McDonalds at the time. I know this because I thought to check the timestamps for other pictures on my phone to make a sort of timeline, and there's a picture at 1:02pm of the bumper stickers on the back of a car I saw at McDonald's. So there was no possible way I, or anybody else, could have taken this picture or that video.  A person I know jokingly said I was being haunted, but it did remind me of this one time when I was 19. So 2016. I was asleep on my mom's couch in the living room, and when I woke up I couldn't find my phone. I ended up finding it on the opposite side of the room, and if I remember correctly, it was really hot. In the gallery were 10+ pictures of the ~roof~ ceiling, and a several-minute long video of the same spot of the ~roof~ ceiling, and towards the end of it, it turns yellow. I never did find out what it was, and have no idea how it could have possibly happened.  So yeah, does anybody have explanations for either of these events? It's super weird.",

He recently closed on a house but asked if he could stay with me until he finishes painting and gets furniture moved in. I said yes because we were really good friends in high school and had a lot of sleepovers so I thought it'd be fine. I'm a single guy and don't have a guest room so I let him sleep on the couch in my home office. Last Monday I went into my office to start work and smelled something that was a mix of wet dog, mildew and body oder. I finally figured out it was my friend's suitcase. When he came back that evening, I asked him if he needed to wash clothes but he told me they were clean. I then realized that he smelled like his suitcase and after a week, my office smells like that too. I don't think he's showered for the whole week he's been here and now I can't get the smell out of my office. I went to his house this weekend and helped move some stuff to try to speed up the process but he has family coming into town for thanksgiving that will help him finish moving. He'll be here for another week at the least. I've tried cleaning my couch during the day while he's not here but the smell will not come out. I don't think I can live with this smell for another week because I'm a very clean person. So, how do I tell my friend that he smells bad and how can I get the smell out of my house?",

    "self_text": "Now, Ik this question has been asked before, I went through most of the responses and here’s how it is in my case:   I’m 20F. I’ve been having coffee since I was 14 I think. When I was 16 it reached a max limit - I’d have almost 6 cups of coffee a day. My mum banned coffee in the house, and requested all the cafés I had access to (as a 16 yr old who couldn’t drive around) not serve me anything with caffeine. I was off all types of teas, sodas and energy drinks as well. This ban lasted almost a year. I have 1 cup of coffee every two days now (max).  I have GAD. I have bipolar type 2. I do not have ADHD. Unless I’ve had 4+ cups of coffee I don’t get jittery either. The only thing that happens with even 1 cup is that I need to use the loo more frequently.  I’ve tried this with different types of coffee - medium roast, dark roast, French roast; cappuccinos, cortados, espressos, Frappuccinos, simple cold coffee with milk/creamer, gigantic cups of hot black coffee, cold brew. 8/10 times, I don’t take sugar in my coffee. I usually opt some form of hot coffee.   So why tf does it still make me sleepy?!",

Edit: Just to clarify, my question has more to do with the dangers that smoking has on non-smokers, like kids of smokers, coworkers of smokers who inhale stuff after the smoker gets back from a smoke break, or even just bystanders who breathe in whatever is stuck on a smoker’s clothes - even if you can’t smell the smoke anymore.",

Any clarity on the below points would be appreciated, but am I on the right path;   Not beating around the bush too much about ways I’m feeling or thoughts I’m having in order to come across as a ‘good’ person  the point is to go deeper into a feeling, and know your therapist understands that feeling ISN’T “who you are” but rather some conditioned part of your mind based on past experiences especially unprocessed trauma  focusing on myself and trying to be as honest and raw about feelings I’ve felt no matter how ugly they appear to be (I come from a very reserved family who I’ve rarely seen cry, and never heard anyone in my family admit they are sad, depressed etc - which makes it hard for me to as well)   Any other tips or perspectives Rae greatly appreciated, thankyou!",

I got confused with how different prices are (some are $30 a day while another website is $70 for the same car) and I do not know why and what to look for. As for the insurance, my CC doesn't have rental car insurance and I read that it is better to get one on the rental company. When I tried to check one car out, there is no option to add an insurance with it.  I am looking for a free cancellation, at least 4 seaters, unlimited mileage but can be flexible. Any recommendations and tips for future trips as well? Thank you!",

Is Tow-truck and body shop fraud a big issue for the insurance industry nowadays? Do these types of fraud affect the income of insurance companies?  Is there a way to be insured against these types of fraud?  Does the so-called Tow-Truck war affect the insurance price and the income of insurance companies? If so, how/why?  If you reply to this post, could you please also state from which country you are from? I'm researching North America, but the input from other regions will also be very useful   Thank you kindly!

I looked them up and they seem to be legit, but I'm not going to say what org/religion for fear of bringing hate.  Now my conspiracy cap is tight on my head, I can't stop thinking that someone stole my card to make these donations in hopes that I turn against the members of this religion, because who would steal my card to donate to an org they care about? The charges likely won't go through (when they're this obviously fraud), so they won't get the money. Now there's just someone out there who thinks a religious org stole their credit card, which I can only imagine was done intentionally.  Is this a typical scam?",

The blue book value on it according to GEICO would be a bit over 5200 bucks. If the repair bill would be over that value they’d declare it a total loss and just give me a check, but what if I didn’t want that and instead wanted to keep the car and obviously not have it become a salvage title total loss car? Can I just have them pay me like 70% of the value or whatever their total loss threshold assessment is and just keep the car as is and do what I want with it? Or do I have to give up the car and take the money OR opt to give it up and get the blue book value as my only options?

I've been to a few concerts in smaller venues, but I tend to get anxious around large groups of people and I think it would help to know what to expect. A few specific questions I have:   How early should I get there to find a parking spot and find my seat? Is an hour too early? Not early enough?  Who/where do they check my ticket? Is it usually at the entrance to the venue or do I need to find some kind of box office? I have the tickets on the Ticketmaster app on my phone if that matters.  The tickets have the seat numbers, but how do I actually find those seats? The arena has a capacity of 14,500 so I doubt there are ushers like at a theater, but if that's the case are there normally signs that say where each section is or people who are available to ask for directions?   I realize the answer to most of these is probably \"it depends,\" but I think just getting a general sense of what to expect or what other people have experienced would go a long way to easing my anxiety. As things are now I'm dreading the logistics of the venue more than I'm looking forward to seeing the concert.",

How would you fix this for yourself? I’m open to ideas, help me Macgruber this. I tried putting a shirt over the back of the chair to help hold the back pad in place but that wasn’t secure. Next up is tying that shirt tight at the bottom, won’t be pretty but that’s not the point.   Tape is not out of the question, I have no one to impress, a spine to save, and homework to do.",

If you look at countries with a hotter climate though, there are vast differences.  In Northern African and Middle Eastern countries people often wear long, flowing clothes, while in other parts of the world, e.g. South America or other parts of Africa, people opt to wear less clothing.  Is this mainly a cultural thing?  Is it related to the humidity? Is it related to the skin-tone of the person wearing the clothes? Why didn´t a style emerge thats best suited for hot weather, like it did for the cold? I do not think the natives of the respective countries would have settled for less than the optimal clothing to wear, so I am unsure if there is something that could be considered the best suited clothing for hotter climates.

I know they can make the rest of the workers work harder to make up for the workload their laid off ex-colleagues did, but there are limits to what a worker can do.  If it is so easy to just cut down the 'unnecessary extras', why hired them at the first place? Shouldn't it be more economical not to hire excessive labour that they don't need.",

I live on rivers/on the coast, so it needs to be good for both.    It needs to fit two people.    Good quality, but not necessarily the most expensive one.     That's all I know. So, any help would be appreciated.",

    "self_text": "I (20M) have posted a lot about my old part-time job working at my childhood elementary school, both because I loved the job when I originally had it and still miss it and sorta wonder where everything went wrong to this day.  I had worked there as the librarian (technically a part-time tutor, but I was running the library all by myself because this school has 85 students and no budget) for 19 hours/week earning $13.88/hour from September 2020 to May 2022. At the start of my second school year, the principal that hired me retired and a new one took her place, and I had just ended the summer having taken on a 2oz per month weed smoking habit (not that I didn't smoke occasionally before) which lead to me having a general attitude of \"I don't  have  to care about things or feel important about things, I can just  choose  to feel good and my day will always be happy and smiling. So why doesn't everyone else just do the same thing?\"  I think what happened is that I got arrogant and felt like I was more important to the school than I actually was. In my first year, my old boss used to always encourage me to strictly enforce library/school rules to the point that the kids hated me for it sometimes, and I also tried to create a fun writing, trivia, storytelling, or puzzle game or activity for the kids to do during library visits just about every day; days without them truly felt like lazy days to me. During my second year, I didn't really do anywhere near as many games or activities with the students during library visits the way I did the year before, and when I did they'd be simple stuff like a card game, instead of being about writing stories or solving puzzles like in the past. I also never scolded the kids for anything and pretty much let them talk however they wanted and get away with small stuff like chewing gum or wearing hats indoors. I mean, I still told them to respect their teachers and didn't allow things like fighting or vandalism but they all knew that with me, they could exhale a little more than they could with a teacher or something.  The only thing I was putting any real passion into during my second year, rather than just going through the motions, was playing with the kindergarten class during lunch recess every day at the end of my shift. I had volunteered as a preschool classroom helper for a month prior to formally starting my job, and during my second year those same kids, whom are absolutely adorable and innocent, were now in kindergarten. This was the class that made me wanna keep working at the school for years up until they graduate 6th grade, watching them grow up along the way. I'd always look forward to walking out on the playground and having all the little ones scream my name and run over to me, super excited.  The specific incident that got me fired was simply flipping off a teacher after she snapped at me when I tried to apologize to her in May 2022. It was a small, petty, non-issue that I wasn't even thinking about 10 minutes later, but then a week later when I came back to work (I was being sent home sick on the day I left because I wasn't out long enough), the principal had launched this huge investigation, sending me home for weeks and then claiming afterwards that the teachers were afraid of how I'd react to things and concerned for the kids safety because I'm always out smoking weed after work and they didn't want me on campus because of it. Total bullshit, all because some lady felt too arrogant and self-important to just let a small, petty little thing go. Is it my fault that I flipped her off? YES! But to say that I was putting the kids in  danger  and making the teachers  fearful  is absurd. One teacher even said to me retroactively that none of the teachers were complaining at all and the new principal just didn't like me and wanted an excuse to get rid of me.  However, looking back on it now, I think people were getting sick of my whole \"IDGAF, let's just be happy and chill, and fuck anyone who doesn't wanna be happy and chill\" attitude I'd developed. What do you think?",

And later, that night, they realize what they did and they pray that their stomp wasn't the one that killed. But it would still be the one that assisted. What happens in people's minds that they ignore the very members of their species and act as if they're just another piece of the ground? How is it possible for the minds of humans to be so blinded that they are oblivious to the fact that there is a human being in front of them and later under them? And sometimes there isn't even a panic. There isn't a fire or a natural disaster happening, and people still get trampled. There isn't any panic in the humans' minds yet they still ignore the dying victims who are unfortunate enough to have slipped and met their demise. The humans have no excuse now in this situation. They enjoyed their fun while other people's fun had already ended in pain. Why?",

    "self_text": "TL;DR What happened to \"live and let live?\" As long as they're not hurting anyone, who cares if they have weird or obscure interests?   I myself have always had a \"live and let live\" mentality. As long as the person isn't hurting anyone they're fine to do whatever they please in my book. I've also always been heavily against judging people for their interests, however weird their interests may be.   I myself have also always been an outcast my whole life everywhere I go (both offline and online), and still am, so I don't judge or make fun of people because I don't wanna make them feel as bad as I do.   However, people in general, and especially through social media and internet culture, seem to enjoy to mock the shit of the aforementioned groups of people in the title. And I just don't get it. If the person enjoys anime, My Little Pony, or furry art then just let them enjoy it! I bet if they were obsessed with something like football no one would bat an eye, but since it's something less socially acceptable like anime, it's okay to make fun of.   I know a common expression is that the aforementioned groups tend to gatekeep a lot or tend to be really aggressive due to their lack of social skills, or that they're really unhygienic or mean to women or whatever. But it kind of makes sense they would be like that after being rejected by their peers their whole life. Being an outcast rarely creates a very sweet, caring person.   Overall, to me this whole thing kind of seems to be a way for people to go, \"I may not be perfect and my life isn't perfect, but at least I'm not as bad as that neckbeard/weeaboo!\"  Or maybe the answer to this whole thing isn't as deep or as complicated as I'm making it out to be. \"People just think they're weirdos, so they make fun of them,\" or something like that. And even then, people likely have nothing against the aforementioned groups, they may just not wanna associate with them.",

    "self_text": "My understanding is that some (not all) of the current map of Africa (mostly sub-saharan) is a result of the way European powers carved it up in the 19th century during the Scramble for Africa. Just looking at many of the borders in Africa, you can see they are somewhat artificial in places. Gigantic straight lines, or odd bits and pieces like the border of Gambia/Senegal.   If some (not all) of the countries didn't really have a unified cultural identity, and existed in their geographic boundaries for purposes of European administration - then why haven't their borders significantly altered in the last 50/60 years since most countries gained full independence?   For example - The states of Namibia, or Democratic Republic of Congo, were not whole unified states prior to European colonisation. Their borders were drawn up by European colonisers. So why haven't those borders changed more radically since the Europeans left?   Shouldn't there have been more wholesale wars, treaties, swaps and changes of areas of administration? Or more new countries being created/declaring independence? Has the UN been a blocker on allowing this to happen? Are there any good lectures or speakers on this subject?",

The store I shop at does have a few coupons sticking out of the shelves but they’re never that great and I know that these extreme couponing people have way more than what’s offered in-store. Where do they come from !!",

    "self_text": "I (20M) have always had a strong, deep attachment to watching cartoons, but I also simultaneously CANNOT get the same appeal from live-action stuff.  The problem with live-action, at least for me, is that for whatever reason I CANNOT follow live-action stories in the same way I can with animated ones. When I'm watching a cartoon, I can listen to the dialogue and pay attention enough to stay interested in the story pretty easily. With live-action though,  especially  if it's in a more cinematic/serious tone, I find it harder to keep up with the dialogue and follow the plot, like I'll be watching for 5-10 minutes and I'll barely have any grasp of the characters, setting, plot, etc. It's like it's in another language that I can only sorta half-understand.  It'd be one thing if this was some childhood trait, but no, I STILL cannot have the same attachment to live-action as I do to cartoons, even as a full grown man. It's not like I don't watch live-action stuff at all mind you, in fact I do like a lot of live-action shows and movies. But most of the live-action stuff I watch is like trendy/pop culture series and franchises. Stuff like Harry Potter, the MCU, 90s sitcoms like Fresh Prince, basically popular franchises and brands. My live-action selection also tends to be more comedy and action focused; serious, dramatic live-action shows are THE WORST for me. I can sorta follow along with an action movie or a sitcom, but you'll lose me completely if you try to show me a crime drama, soap opera, or Oscar bait movie.  I've heard that being heavily into cartoons as a grown adult is common among autistic people (not sure if that's true or just internet trolls calling cartoon fans \"autistic\"), and I myself was diagnosed with Asperger's at age 3, when symptoms may first show, but because kids outgrow behaviors as they age, you can't say for sure if you've got it until you're about 6 or 7. My mom never rechecked me when I reached that age, she just rolled with that same diagnosis from when I was 3, and since I've outgrown the vast majority of those behaviors and traits I had as a kid, A LOT of people question or flat out refuse to believe the idea that I have autism (even a family friend who worked as an ER nurse back in the 90s). So who knows what could be causing this phenomenon.",

The reason I hate this house is because I have no friends houses I can just walk or bike to, no where I can meet up with friends or nowhere I can just go out if I want to without my dad driving me. I’ve been living in this house for four years and have really started to become more miserable. He’s started to notice something is wrong and I keep telling him everything is ok. One reason I’m afraid to tell him is that he really likes being out in the woods, I don’t, and he knows that. Another reason is I want to be able to go places without him having to drive me. Another reason is, it’s a new house, he’s not just going to move us, which he would feel bad about knowing I hate this house. Another reason, recently he said to me “I’m trying to make this house as nice as possible for you guys” (Me, my sister, and his girlfriend who’s over occasionally) which showed me he want me to like this house, I know he’s already dumped thousands of dollars into making this house nice, and recently, he hasn’t wanted to telling me, but I know he’s been struggling with money. What do I say to him without making him feel bad, but also not waste any money trying to make me happier with the house?",

We both work full-time professional jobs though do feel underpaid. We are feeling the hike in energy bills and other things but generally feel fairly ok and certainly very lucky compared to lots of other people. I see a lot of chat on Reddit & elsewhere online about how individuals in the US on a salary of USD 50-60k (c. £44-53k) are struggling. To me, being in the UK, that's a really good salary for one person, and a household with a couple both earning that amount would be doing really well, even with children & a mortgage. Also it would be hard for me to be on that kind of salary in my field (it would be senior management level).  So is the cost of living crazy high in the states? I know health insurance & medical bills are insane but does that also apply to rent/ mortgages, bills & food? I'd be interested to get some insight!",

What makes a table feminine, what makes a tree masculine etc. Particularly confusing is stuff like 'le feminisme' (feminism, masculine) and 'la masculinité' (masculinity, feminine)  Presumably there must have been a reason, a logic behind which are masculine and which are feminine, especially since it changes the form of many adjectives surrounding them as well...",

    "self_text": "I count this as a stupid question because I can Google it and the answer seems to be the same across the board: you need 6-8 sessions for the hair to completely not grow back.   I had 2 sessions (plus 1 more just for legs) about 4 months ago and the hair in the treated regions didn't grow back until mid-August but now is just as thick as it ever was. I had a large portion of my body treated and so the cost per session was pretty damn high.   I want to go back and get more but I am struggling to believe that after 2-3 sessions the hair is EXACTLY as thick as before. I know the explanation goes something like \"the laser targets the hair in a specific growth phase, so you need to target each hair in each phase before the area will be hairless\"   This doesn't make sense to me because wouldn't it then follow that my hair should now fall out and then be dormant for a longer period of time? That would make it appear thinner, as certain hairs would be unable to grow when they enter the phase which my previously completed sessions DID zap.   Can someone explain it really simply for me?   Or, if anyone has personal experience with this, reassurance that it was also the case for you and the hair did eventually go away with more sessions would also be much appreciated.   This is purely cosmetic, not medical, so I hope it doesn't break rule 3",

When I got into the car there were beeping sounds and lights in the dash.  Me and my friend noticed that there was a cop in the parking lot, and we thought he would probably have jumper cables on him.  We wave the cop over and he proceeds to get out the jumper cables to put them on.  We put them on our side and the cop puts them on his side but in the wrong terminals, he notices what he did and after a couple seconds of sparking he puts them on the right terminals.  When I get inside my car all the lights have turned off and there’s no sounds when I try to turn it on.  After that the cop left and we got his name and everything.  The next day me and my dad put a new battery in because we thought it may have just been that but nothing in the car is responding.  We stopped at the police station where the officer said he was from, they haven’t gotten back to us about what they can do yet.  In the case where they don’t do anything about it, is there anything that can be done to get the money to fix my car from them?",

My parents are currently back in my home country trying to get some stuff taken care of (very stressful time for them). A couple weeks ago I got into an accident and I got the persons info, insurance and insurance has already paid for the damage to the shop but the shop cannot get me in until a couple days. Damage is completely fixable & I am paying the deductible and obviously the insurance going up as well. My insurance agent is my uncle so i called him first and explained the situation. I didn’t want to tell my parents as they are all the way in Nepal, with a 12 hour time difference and they wouldn’t be able to do anything about the situation except be upset and have it looming over their head the whole time they were there. My plan was to get it fixed first and then let them know that it had taken place as there is no point in stressing someone out about a situation they can’t control. My sister came home randomly last night & saw the car sitting in the garage and completely went off on me. I know how bad that can look. She said I was disgusting and irresponsible for not telling them. I explained my side and she said it was trying to avoid accountability & wasn’t acting like an adult but I genuinely thought the best thing to do would be to at least have it in the shop and take the steps to get it fixed before - and i did this to AVOID looking irresponsible. Accidents happen & that’s why there’s insurance but she is really so upset and i apologized to her for not saying something to my parents but explained why I felt out I felt. She’s not having it at all & keeps calling me a liar. Im obviously also scared of their reactions and confrontation in general so I really didn’t want to ruffle any feathers or freak them out.

(Which is what I’m asking about) that everything she does is for a reason, when I asked what they are or wether they “should remain a secret, she answered the latter  Now im mostly concerned due to the recent 2 boys being 1. a creep who I won’t disclose where she knows him from Incase this post is found, but when I kept warning her about his actions and that he was gonna ask her out since he wasn’t looking for friends and it was obvious, she kept making excuses, then recently he asks her out having not known her for a month, afterwards I thought she’d stop after rejecting him but she still texts him, and he hasn’t changed his mannerisms at all, so he’s still the same, still after her  The other guy is some guy who she says is “nice” and then proceeds to tell me he has taken a photo of her, alone, and tagged her on Snapchat (now mind you we live in a very conservative religious society, so it isn’t ordinary or really looked up to for a boy and girl to be any form of close in public, and any boys who do so are almost always only there because they want the girl)   So my question is, what “reasons” would she have? I know she isn’t lying about the dating part, and I know she isn’t playing around, what could she truly have in mind to think any of this is a good idea?   (Before anyone says this is all normal, our culture is different, and she knows that what I say is right about the boys, having been one of said boys who was after her years ago till I reformed)",

And listening to classical music is considered to be quality in the western world. I come from Africa and where I came from, they didn’t care that much about European old classical music. I ask myself in a lot of cases what makes an art peace better than other art pieces. The amount of work put on something? No that cannot be because some works could be done in a very short time once the creator is inspired. Do I have the right to judge people based on the music they listen?  The same goes to painting too. Some paintings are ridiculously expensive. I, once, waited in line for like 2 hours in Louvre to see Mona Lisa and it is this small painting of a woman that I don’t even think is that pretty. I felt embarrassed for myself afterwards.",

(I’m pretty sure that’s false.) Sedition is an act of rebellion, treason is an act meant to injure the state.  Treason requires an act of betrayal (whatever that means?), such as espionage.   Reading the actual Federal laws, it outlines treason as an act of war or aiding a foreign power against your own country. Sedition is opposing the authority of the government, such as rebellion or insurrection. That is to say, there is no foreign power involved.  Is that the correct difference?  The follow up question is what distinguishes an act of violence between sedition and treason?  Because violence could be described as act of war, it seems murky.",

Raw onion is \"sharp\" or \"spicy\" to me, though not spicy in the sense that it's hot. When I chew it stings my tongue really painfully, like Im eating razorblades.  Cooked or pickled onion is fine though. Especially cooked it loses all its sharpness. Is raw onion supposed to be sharp and spicy like this or am I allergic or something?",

I recently saw an article that stated that the vast majority of people who identify as non binary are afab (assigned female at birth) and among teenagers the percentage of afab people who identified as nonbinary was growing much faster than amab people. This coincides with my personal experience, where every single nonbinary person I know is afab.  I am not saying amab nonbinary people don’t exist, I’m simply wondering why they seem to be less frequent than afab nonbinary people.",

    "self_text": "I read that the average wedding cost in the US is like 26k. The median is lower, but still probably over 10k. How do people manage to spend that much money? There are a lot of things that aren't needed.   The venue can simply be a local forest preserve. You can rent a picnic shelter with a 100 person capacity for under $200.  Most men have a suit and tie. Most women own a dress. That should be sufficient. There is no need to buy or rent an expensive suit or dress that will probably never be worn again.  Makeup can be done by yourself.  No photographer or videographer is needed. Smartphones are sufficient.  No flowers are needed.  No music is required.  Why do you need special invitations cards? Can't you just call or email everyone?  Food does not have to be expensive. You can buy 50 Costco pizzas for under $550, including sales tax. The drinks can be 25 2L bottles of various soft drinks, which should cost less than $50.   All in all, costs should be under $2,000. And that is if you have a lot of people. If you only have a few people, you don't need as many pizzas or sodas, and can buy a smaller cake, and can use someone's yard instead of renting a picnic shelter. So why do Americans spend so much, when most of them are living paycheck to paycheck? Wouldn't it be smarter to pay down loans, put the money in a 401(k), Roth IRA, 529 for your future children, or simply buy index funds with it?",

Because of this, if any form of argument or debate ever comes up, I immediately fall silent or just lie and tell the other party they are right to drop the conversation.

The driver to the right of me kept going and stayed in the lane that will close. This caused for both of our cars to pretty much be beside each other in almost a single lane and then they sped up and cut me off to be in front of me.  This got me really mad and I wanted them to get a taste of their own medicine, so I passed them and cut them off too.  They kept honking and as I was looking in my rearview mirror, saw them pull their phone out and take a picture which I’m assuming is of my license plate.. and then everyone went on their own way.  Can this driver actually do anything? Is there such a thing that enables drivers file something against you in situations like this? Why would they take a picture? Especially that they are in the wrong to begin with. Keeping in mind that no accident or contact was made between the two vehicles.  The only things I could think of is either a false accusation of a hit-and-run, or for them to report me for cutting them off.

    "self_text": "So before i get flamed in the comments, I think immigration is a good thing, bringing in skilled labor, is always good for the economy, to keep sectors afloat and expand. But that's not the question at hand.  So, most countries every year allow X # of immigrant applications to go through.  lets say 300k for this example., that's determined by policy for various reasons. But when natural population growth is expected to rise by 300k as well, thats 600k total new people expected next year. But housing projects are all pre planned, Say 400k more homes are expected to be completed next year, that's still 200k without homes. Its a key issue when it comes to the housing crisis, and sky high prices in areas. Most immigrants are sent to city centers rather than rural areas, because they have the support systems needed to transition them to their life in the new country. So housing is over burdened, not enough to go around, and not keeping pace with a rising population.  So, citizens are going to have babies, policy has no say in that. Housing is mostly private projects, they can be incentivized by government policy, but for the most part, its out of the governments hands. The only thing that's can be changed freely year to year is the number, represenitives assign to immigration numbers.  If the projected population cant sustain itself as is, why are governments raising that number, higher than is sustainable?",

I really don't understand it, with the Taliban in charge she wouldn't be allowed to study, work or go out back in Afghanistan. In fact, Afghanistan doesn't have a women's team anymore, yet she is still a die-hard fan of their men's team. Eg: she was organising watch parties with her friends. They won some match and she took us all out for dinner. Basically, she is hardcore.   If Switzerland oppressed me like that, I would absolutely hate everything Swiss.

In hindsight I'm thinking that was a mistake.  I broke one of my own cardinal rules of the road and it resulted in a pretty gnarly t-bone accident. I was in the right turn of a stoplight that passed an exit from a gas station.  A white car was coming out of the gas station and turning left. I flashed them to give them the OK to let them through as the light was still red (no oncoming traffic passing me yet), but there was some confusion between them and a blue car wanting to turn left from the opposite lane. Sometime at this point the light I'm turning at turns green, but I'm focused on the guy coming out of the gas station turning left. The blue car makes his turn and the white car starts his turn. I don't even have time to realize at this point that someone is passing me to make the green light, a grey car, and the white car completely t-bones them, and right in front of my car.  TL;DR: I let someone go through even though they didn't have the legal right away and they ended up t-boning someone. Am I at fault in anyway?",

In fact, sometimes if I wake up with a dead arm from sleeping on it, I cannot even make it move until some feeling returns, no matter how hard I will it. She said she just \"learned to walk\".

    "self_text": "Wasn’t sure where else I could post this, so sorry if it doesn’t really fit.  When I was about 8, my mom had breast cancer. I liked helping her out a lot with the IVs and bandages and other medical stuff and I was honestly pretty good at it for a kid.   One day, when no one was home, my mom passed out and hit her head on the bathroom tile. She was out for an indeterminate amount of time but the paramedics said she was alright, just couldn’t be alone. That day my dad picked up me and my sister (12 yo) from school and asked us to stay with our mom and watch over her because he didn’t want to miss work and get a sub (he’s a teacher).   At the time, I didn’t think anything of it, I was just excited to miss school mostly. But when my mom re-told me the story recently, she was clearly kinda bitter and upset about the incident. I did think it was weird because he probably could’ve gotten another teacher to watch his class and there was only half a day left. I can see her side, but also, the paramedics said she was fine and he told us to call 911 if anything happened and just help her walk and such. It wasn’t difficult work, I think we just mostly watched TV until he came home.  As far as I can remember, my dad took care of my mom pretty well when she was sick. I just wanted some outside opinions on what you think of this story. Was what my dad did weird or did it make sense to you?",

In fact, I just graduated from high school earlier this year and before I left, some of the teachers said they'd like for people to visit. I most likely won't do that, since I'm way too shy and would feel uncomfortable, but I don't see why it's bad.  On here and a couple of other sites, however,  I've seen a few discussions about people who visit their old high school (or any other level of education, but that's the one they talk about the most) after leaving, and while some said it was fine, I saw comments with at least dozens of likes/upvotes saying that they dislike those people and don't understand them at all. There were also comments with less likes, but still a significant amount,  that said it's \"sad\" or \"embarrassing,\" and if anyone does that, that probably means they \"peaked in school\" (I'm not even entirely sure what that means,  but people have been using it as an insult).  A lot of them said they absolutely hated school and wouldn't even think about going back, which is perfectly fine. But, I  don't understand why they think it's bad for others to do it. Like, if they literally just left, maybe they still have friends there or teachers that they really liked, and they want to see them again. Or they just wanted to look at the place again. One example of this happening at my school was around 3 years ago. I was in a group that met after classes ended, and a couple of times, former students who were members before visited and no one said it was weird. The group directors were actually happy to see them.   If someone is constantly disrupting classes or something, then I would see why people have issues with that. But just visiting the place for a few minutes after getting permission from the school? I don't see anything wrong with that, and I'm wondering why so many others do.",

Every clip I’ve seen of the war seems like hell on Earth and I feel bad for any person that suffers through that from either side.",

    "self_text": "Aside from shadow people and the occasional ghost of an actual family member long gone, there have been 2x in my life I have seen a \"ghost\" that looks exactly like my siblings. First time, we all were laying down in the living room after watching TV. My husband (BF at the time) and I saw my step sister stand up, walk up the starea and jot come back down. After a moment we looked back over and she was literally still laying in the floor passed out.  Second time, my husband and I were playing \"hide n seek\" in the dark with my brother. I WATCHED my brother run from the hallway into my room, and into my closet. We chased him, went and opened the closet and and stared face to face with my brother, but he had solid black eyes. We freaked and ran out yelling which prompted my real brother to run out of a different room confused AF.   To this day I wonder what the hell those were, and would have thought I was nuts if my hubby hadn't seen it too. He can confirm the same stories.   What the fuck does that mean? Anyone have any supernatural insights that may be?",

Why don't the planets move around the sun in a large sphere, so to speak, independent of the position of the other planets?  To make it a bit clearer: If I sketch the solar system three-dimensionally from above, so to speak, all the planets move in ellipses around the sun in their orbits. In this model, I could therefore place a sheet of paper on the highest point (the closest point to me looking at the model from above) of the sun and none of the planets would touch this sheet of paper, because the planets do not act in the form of a sphere within the system, but on a surface.  I hope it is understandable what my question is aiming at. If not, I will gladly try to illustrate it visually.  Why do the planets move like this: solarsystem moving like a circle And not like this:solarsystem like a atom, like a sphere",

    "self_text": "So it was my understanding all cars which want to be “street legal” must undergo safety testing which destroys or damages the car. This makes sense for cars which are produced in huge quantities as I’m assuming this is just considered a sunk cost. However, cars with limited runs (ie some super or hyper-cars with runs <1000), seem to have to small of a run for this cost to be absorbed. If their cars have to be tested by multiple agencies across whatever countries they are hoping to sell this car in, I don’t see how this cost could be absorbed unless these cars are treated differently or if the cars can be tested once for use around the globe.

About a month later, he found out that his insurance was billed about 700$ for this scan as well. So ~1500$ in total. Now we think medical insurance is more or less a scam. He pays about 50$ per month for his insurance. By the way, the scan found nothing abnormal in his brain.
