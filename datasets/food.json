    "self_text": "Hi Everyone! I just bought a stainless steel skillet and everytime I use it something is always getting stuck on it :( specifically when itâ€™s time to fry something.   I wait until the pan is hot, splash water on it to make sure the water bounces instead of fizzles, add my oil, and then the fish - but when I try to turn the fish the bottom of the fish sticks to the pan. (The temp is on 5 and it begins to fry btw).  What on earth am I doing wrong? :(",

    "self_text": "Hello hello! So im planning on making a potato gratin for Thanksgiving, and I know the typical recipe uses a heavy cream mixture. But if I were to want to \"jazz it up\" using a bechamel instead of cream, would that be good or would that be too heavy? Also if there are any other ways to spice it up or just any adjustments you guys like, I would love to know and potentially try em! Thank you guys",

    "self_text": "Whenever I make a savory dish that includes dates, they end up overwhelmingly sweet and nearly inedible. Dishes I'm referring to are Middle Eastern inspired dishes like a lamb tagine. Are there ways to counteract the sweetness like adding acidity or a bitter element? I'm not of Middle Eastern decent, so I'd love some advice from someone who is more familiar with the cuisine. Thanks!",
