    "self_text": "Hi Everyone! I just bought a stainless steel skillet and everytime I use it something is always getting stuck on it :( specifically when itâ€™s time to fry something.   I wait until the pan is hot, splash water on it to make sure the water bounces instead of fizzles, add my oil, and then the fish - but when I try to turn the fish the bottom of the fish sticks to the pan. (The temp is on 5 and it begins to fry btw).  What on earth am I doing wrong? :(",
