    "self_text": "Hey everyone-  I was dismissed from the school after failing 2 quarters in a row, and not attending the next 2 quarters (the second quarter I didn't attend is the current fall term).   I finally started writing my Multiple Withdrawals Appeal to explain the 2 quarters I failed last year. But I just saw a MyUCLA notice from a month ago saying I'm dismissed from the university.  I'm kinda panicking because the deadline is in two days (November 25th), and there aren't any counselors available by then. I met a counselor way back in March, when I was planning to submit a Multiple Withdrawals Appeal. Now that I'm dealing with a dismissal , I'm worried that the school will view my appeal poorly because I didn't seek help regarding my dismissal.  I was looking for advice from anyone who's succesfully appealed for dismissal. I'm wondering if it matters whether I saw a counselor, as long as my appeal demonstrates that I've taken action and grown in other ways..   Any help would be appreciated!  tldr: can't see a counselor before submitting my dismissal appeal. scared that this will greatly lower my chances of being readmitted. looking for advice/experience",

    "title": "Strike FAQ",
    "self_text": "Hi everyone! I've been seeing a lot of questions about the UAW strike and I wanted to provide some clear answers. I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student who has been working closely with UAW organizers to build undergraduate support for the strike, so feel free to DM me any other questions you might have as well.  &#x200B;    What does \"crossing the picket line\" mean? Should I go to class or not?    I want to make it very clear that UAW  has not called for a student boycott of classes.  If you would like to skip your class and join the picket line, I would personally certainly encourage that! But there has not been an official call to skip classes, and if you have a professor who is requiring attendance or something similar, that is their fault, not yours, and you shouldn't feel bad about going to class.  Picket lines are public demonstrations by striking workers to visibly show their power in numbers and let others know that there is a strike happening at the business they are picketing. 'Not crossing the picket line' varies from strike to strike, but typically means not supporting the business currently being picketed. At UCLA, this means not buying things from campus stores & restaurants, and not going to any discussion sections still being held during the strike.  &#x200B;    How long will the strike last for?    The strike will last until the UC administration agrees to bargain fairly with the striking workers. This entails the UC agreeing to stop their  illegal  interference in the bargaining process, and coming to the bargaining table with actual proposals that workers might be willing to accept. Every single striking TA I have talked to has told me they are very worried about their students and do not want a long strike, but that is not their decision at this point - it's the UC's. Whether the strike lasts for a week or a month will depend on when the UC agrees to bargain fairly. Basically, if you want a shorter strike, support our TAs and tell the UC to bargain fairly now!  &#x200B;    Isn't academia a cushy profession? Why are TA's striking?    This is a very common misconception. Some facts: the average yearly salary for a TA at the university of California is  below the poverty line for Los Angeles .  90%  of all UC TAs statewide are classified as Rent Burdened, meaning they pay >30% of their income in rent, and many pay up to  70%  of their income on rent. For those who live in university-owned housing such as Weyburn Terrace in Westwood, this is money going out of their paycheck right back to their employer. Academic workers also have terrible protections against workplace harassment, insufficient support for working parents, huge financial costs for international scholars, and a laundry list of other terrible conditions they are fighting against. A full look at the horrible treatment of academic workers by the UC can be found here. While academic work has never actually been a \"cushy ivory tower\" job, the historical collapse of state funding for the UC coupled with its increasing privatization has made workers' conditions worse and worse, resulting in the high exploitation we see today.  &#x200B;    Will higher pay for academic workers increase my tuition?    Our striking workers' current proposed wage increases would only constitute a 3% increase in the UC's entire $44 billion dollar budget. The work done by TAs, Student Researchers, and Post-Doctoral Students makes up the majority of teaching and research done at the UC, bringing in record-setting grant funding for our schools, and yet their pay is 22x less than average UC Chancellor salary and 58x less than the average UC hospital CEO salary. California is increasing the UC's funding by $602.3 million in 2022-2023, but currently that money is not being invested fairly: chancellors will receive a 9% wage  increase  while grad workers will receive a 5% wage  decrease  under the current proposal. While 90% of grad workers are rent burdened, the UC just bought President Drake a  $6.5 million dollar mansion . More examples of the horrific pay inequity at the UC (and sources for the above claims) can be found here.   TL;DR: No, the workers' current proposed wage increases would come from a fair reallocation of UC's vast resources, not an increase in our tuition.   &#x200B;    How can I support the strike?    The best way students can support the strike is by  joining our TAs on their picket lines!  There are 6 picket lines on campus that will be going from 8am-4pm every day of the strike. They are at the Broad Art Center, Bunche Hall, LuValle Commons, the Inverted Fountain, Engineering VI, and the Gonda Building. A map of all the pickets can be found here. Joining a picket line is super easy: just walk over to the picket, grab one of the many signs laying around (they're there for you to use!), and join the march!  Another critical way to support TAs is through donations. You can donate money to their strike fund here. Donations of food, water and coffee are also always needed on the picket lines! Simply show up to any of the picket lines with some food or drinks and the organizers there will be more than happy to accept them.  You can also sign this undergraduate petition to support our TAs that has nearly 1,500 signatures currently: tinyurl.com/SupportOurTAs. If you'd like to get plugged in to organizing information and bargaining updates, feel free to select the \"get involved\" option on the petition as well.  &#x200B;  Thank you so much r/UCLA! Solidarity!",

My current GPA in Junior year is 3.24 unweighted and 4.2 weighted, my PSAT that year was 1260 and I waiting for the one this year, I feel I did way better so I am expecting a higher score. This year so far I have done way better since I have gotten used to the migraines and I have dealt with my depression to the best of my abilities. I have gotten almost all ‚ÄúA‚Äùs except for one ‚ÄúB‚Äù this past quarter for a mistake I made. I am expecting to get all A this quarter and the rest or close enough to that goal. I am taking two APs and one honors this year and have take some slightly easier classes in case I hadn‚Äôt been able to deal with my migraines. I expect to take some more APs next years. I am positive I can get higher than a 3.4 GPA before my senior year starts. Are my chances of getting into UCLA possible?

You're here studying ... whatever. Doing research on .... whatever. You're doing this because you're interested in learning it, for whatever reason - post-graduate academia or industry.  You TA for one class (as far as I know), and you hold one 1-2 hour discussion section a week along with 2 hours of OH every week. On a different post, I saw a TA state that they work 15-20 hours a week. That's great. You get paid for 20 hours a week. There's 3 quarters, 10 weeks long, plus finals week, plus let's add a week after finals week just to be safe, that's 36 weeks total. You make approximately $26k for it. 26000/36/20 = $36/hr. If you're a GSR, you get paid even more. You even get paid for your research. On top of that, your tuition is subsidized (as far as I'm aware, if you're in Engineering at least).  You're a student, doing research (and getting paid for it), and working a part-time job besides (and getting paid quite heavily for it), and you want more.  Again, you're a student. You signed up for this. You went to graduate school. You wanted this. In a few years, you'll reap the rewards. For now, this is your situation. You cannot expect more from this when this is a situation you put yourself in to further yourself in life. It's not about how expensive rent is. We all know rent in LA is expensive, but you put yourself here. Take some responsibility for your situation. It's benefiting you to be here, and deep down, you're doing it for no one else.  You want to get paid more? For what? For rent? The solution there is to have the university offer housing, as it does for undergraduates, not an increased demand of $$$ for the amount (20 hrs/wk) that you work that you already get reimbursed for quite generously.  This strike isn't taking anything away from you, but it's taking everything away from us undergraduates. For that reason, in my mind, this strike is a completely entitled, selfish thing to do. Convince me otherwise, but that's where I stand.",

    "title": "Conflicted about strike",
    "self_text": "I fully supported the staff strike that occurred last year. Those university employees are significantly underpaid and, in my view, were taken advantage of by the university. They also work full time jobs. These are people's (potentially life-long) careers and they deserve commensurate compensation for themselves and their families. I also fully believe that lecturers here are significantly underpaid and mistreated while essentially doing the same job as full-time professors. But I'm more conflicted about striking of TAs and GSRs.  24k is an unacceptable amount to pay someone for a full time job -- but being a TA is not a full time job. As others on this sub have attested, the workload varies from 15-20 hours a week, which means most TA's hourly compensation is actually excellent. The vast majority of grad student's tuition is also covered by the university in exchange for research. Ostensibly, the tuition for these programs would normally run somewhere between 20-50k. Therefore we can deduce that most TA's really make between 45-75k a year, assuming their grad programs' tuition is covered.  Getting a PhD/Masters is also a privilege: these degrees usually to high-paying, even lucrative careers. No one is forcing anyone to go to grad school -- people apply here on their own whim to study, do research, graduate and then advance their professional careers (and make money). TA jobs are transitory (not permanent) jobs, and grad students get them without any prior teaching experience. Grad school is also out of reach for the vast majority of Americans: most people need to start their professional careers immediately out of undergrad (or graduate with student loan debt). Many people work low paying public service jobs or join the military to get government aid to subsidize their grad school education.  In my opinion, there is a distinction between underrepresented blue-collar workers striking for fair treatment and compensation, and graduate students demanding more pay for what is essentially part time work. I fully believe graduate students are essential to the function of the university, and maybe they should be paid more than 24k. I'm sympathetic to grad students who struggle financially. However I'm not sure the current salary demand of 55k for 15-20 hours of work per week is a realistic or fair ask (the post-doc lecturer pay demand of 70k I fully agree with).  Please let me know if I'm misinformed...",

I‚Äôve copied a previous comment I made which includes information regarding the strike‚Äîas well as how we got to this point.  There are copious documents, outlines and discussions on what UC has done to warrant a strike. This strike is a federally protected strike as UC has acted illegally in bargaining‚Äîwhich is why UC won‚Äôt attempt to stop it even though there is an anti strike clause (because they know it‚Äôs protected and they broke the law).  Document explaining the disparities of the unions‚Äô demands and UC‚Äôs offers: https://www.fairucnow.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/UCOP-Update-Response-2022-11-10.pdf  UAW Powerpoint outlining the purpose of the strike and what UAW does: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11AsUP9NcVjirdWlIMxRX3IS8zxk-AcAo6chbxzNPfzs/edit  In short the reasons for the strike include:  -UC made unilateral changes to working conditions without negotiating  -UC refused to provide necessary information for negotiations  -UC obstructed the bargaining process (this contract has been in bargaining for over a year now) through failures to show up, deliberate attempts to mislead and stall as well as coming completely unprepared to bargaining meetings.  As a result, Academic Workers have filed 27 charges against UC with the Public Employee Relations Board (PERB), that status of which (and exact charges) can be seen here: https://www.fairucnow.org/ulp/",

    "title": "Strike of 48,000 academic workers in California enters third day",
    "self_text": "Today marks the third day of the strike by 48,000 academic workers throughout the University of California (UC) system. The strike involves  postdoctoral and academic researchers, tutors, graduate student  instructors and assistants in the United Auto Workers (UAW). The academic workers are demanding adequate pay and benefits to address the  immense and soaring cost of living in California.  The strike is already the  largest university strike in US history  and includes half of  the roughly 100,000 academic workers in the UAW. It is taking place as  more than 1,700 part-time faculty and UAW members at the New School in  New York City will begin a strike on Wednesday, joining the 250  HarperCollins workers already on strike in the city.  In an effort to smother opposition, the UC administration on the first day of the strike requested that a mediator be brought in. Ryan  King, a UC spokesperson, said in a statement Monday, ‚ÄúAt this time, we  believe that the best path to an agreement is with the aid of a third-party mediator.‚Äù  UAW officials have so far rejected the proposal for a mediator, but they have opened up the pickets to various Democratic politicians. The strike is, in fact, pitting academic workers in direct conflict with the Democratic Party, which controls the UC Board of Regents and California politics at the state and local level.  Reporters from the WSWS spoke with striking university workers, many of whom expressed concerns over the cost of living and intimidation from academic advisors. They also declared their solidarity with workers in  the humanities who are regularly paid less than their counterparts in  hard sciences.  Will and Richard, UC San Diego graduate students in the physics department, said workers were demanding a 100 percent increase in their wages. Will noted that he and his partner currently live in graduate student housing, but they are only guaranteed access to this housing for two years. When they are forced out of the lower-cost graduate student  housing, he said he could face a situation where rent consumes ‚Äú75 percent of my current salary, for a rent of $3,000 month.‚Äù Off-campus  housing also comes with the costs of commute, and he noted, ‚ÄúI cannot  afford gas and a car.‚Äù  Richard said, ‚ÄúI live in Santee, I cannot  even afford to live in San Diego.‚Äù Monthly, he brings home $2,500 and is concerned particularly for the high costs of insurance for himself and  his partner.  Richard also stressed the importance of academic accountability. ‚ÄúSomething I am passionate about is that I want to make  sure we get fair treatment for academic workers. Too many of my  colleagues have been gaslit or face deceit from their PIs [Principal  Investigators, or lead researcher in a grand project]. I‚Äôve seen PIs claim ownership over the work of grad students, and it‚Äôs absolutely unfair. There are no protections for academic workers. And grievances go nowhere.‚Äù  Megan, a second-year graduate student in psychology at UCSD, said that one of  the main reasons she is striking is because she wants to see more  protections given to academic workers, particularly at the hands of PIs.  ‚ÄúWe have no protections from academic bullying,‚Äù Megan said. She  explained that serious grievances that have been filed for abuse or from a PI claiming ownership of a TA‚Äôs work have fallen on deaf ears.  ‚ÄúFor raising a grievance, I have instead been kicked out of my lab, my  entire degree is at risk. Sure I would like to be paid more, but because  of this issue I will not be finishing my degree here. I currently live  in graduate housing. My job and housing are at risk.‚Äù  Read the rest here.",

This evening, she just sent an email EXCLUDING all graduate students at the School of Music essentially telling students to not strike unless they want to face negative repercussions... thoughts?  &#x200B;   Edit : The part that I found concerning was #1) That the dean excluded ALL graduate students from this email, not just those with TAships or under GSR pay and #2) the following section of her email:   \"As a citizen, you can clearly act as you see fit.  Your rights as a citizen, however, do not obviate your obligations as contracted and paid employees of the University.   You are expected to be in class and to perform the duties for which the university pays you.¬†Ladder faculty are contracted as salaried employees for nine months and include an agreed-upon number of courses as assigned by your chair. Temporary faculty/lecturers are hired and paid for the specific work of delivering the classes for which you were contracted.¬†   The canceling of classes by anyone under contract to deliver them will be treated as absenteeism in violation of your work agreement.  The University and campus have the right to dock your pay should you not perform the duties to which you agreed when you signed your employment agreement.\"  This was surprising to me as many other departments didn't specifically discourage faculty support of the strike in their emails, and I know many professors who have already cancelled lectures in support of their TAs.  https://preview.redd.it/rw7q5ur48vz91.png?width=1262&format=png&auto=webp&s=426dcf97564e589fac2258f7232b25995d7d46dd  https://preview.redd.it/5cj8uir48vz91.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=b792ba2c6a554bbfa88b934448020e55d67073ae  https://preview.redd.it/k7sxj4s48vz91.png?width=1178&format=png&auto=webp&s=648b7652bee43c497a9dc2f92f47e19167b59204  https://preview.redd.it/y4v4z2s48vz91.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff1b5bcae53b6f96b56b120d4e9caf90956913d2  https://preview.redd.it/fcaybir48vz91.png?width=1220&format=png&auto=webp&s=74c1daf41987c1cb1fc8ea1da7425fd0cd865b68",

In week 9, he sat a seat away from usual, and the girl moved in as well as they continued sitting in silence with a space apart from anyone else.  Finally, this week, he talked to her a little after lecture yesterday, and asked for her number today .... Then continued sitting in silence together and not talking to her even after class ends.

    "self_text": "Dear Fellow Workers,   The strike by 48,000 academic workers in  the University of California system is a historic struggle that requires  the support of all workers. Your fight for the doubling of starting  wages, cost-of-living protection and affordable housing, health care and  childcare resonates with millions of workers across the US and  throughout world.¬†  But a warning must be made: If your strike remains in the hands of  the UAW bureaucracy it will be isolated and betrayed like the 2020 COLA  strike and so many other struggles.   Strikers have already  informed me that the Student Researchers United has dropped the demands  for COLA and annual wage increases, defying the will of their own  members and breaking ranks with striking workers in other unions.   At  the same time, UAW bargainers have increasingly held secret talks with  management, ignoring demands by rank-and-file workers that every  bargaining session, in full, be live-streamed to the membership.¬†  This  has provoked a firestorm of opposition with strikers denouncing the  bargaining committee and insisting, ‚ÄúNo COLA, no contract!‚Äù Increasingly  there is a sense that rank-and-file workers must take control of the  situation or the strike will be betrayed.   The officers in the UAW  locals are currently under enormous pressure from the UAW ‚ÄúSolidarity  House‚Äù apparatus to drop everything and shut down the strike. The union  bureaucracy cannot tolerate academic workers winning major wages raises  and COLA because it will encourage autoworkers and other workers in the  UAW and beyond to demand the same. It would give an enormous impetus to  the rank-and-file rebellion that is already underway, and which is an  existential threat to the privileged positions of the pro-company police  force that runs the UAW.  But  this is precisely what is necessary. I urge striking UC academic  workers to follow the lead of autoworkers, railroad workers and  educators, who have formed rank-and-file committees as a new center of  democratic decision-making and workers‚Äô power.

    "title": "University of California strike begins second week: ‚ÄúWe need a society that works for everyone, not just the capitalists at the top‚Äù",
    "self_text": "Today  marks the beginning of the second week of the strike by 48,000   academic workers in the University of California (UC) system. The action   is the largest strike of academic workers in United States history,   pitting graduate student instructors (GSIs), postdocs, researchers and   other academic workers against the Democratic Party-controlled UC   administration and Board of Regents.  The  strikers, who are members of the three different locals of the  United  Auto Workers (UAW) union, are demanding a 100 percent salary   increase‚Äîfrom an impossibly low $24,000 a year to $54,000‚Äîto address   California‚Äôs skyrocketing rents and other living expenses. The strike   has galvanized workers throughout UC‚Äôs 10 campuses and far more broadly.  The UAW bureaucracy is attempting to smother the strike as it did the 2020 wildcat strike   and grade boycott by limiting the action to an ‚ÄúUnfair Labor Practice‚Äù   work stoppage, not a strike over economic demands. This would allow  the  UAW bureaucracy to shut the strike down any time it claims  management  has resumed ‚Äúgood faith negotiations,‚Äù even if UC  administrators  continue to reject the workers‚Äô just economic demands.  However,   it is precisely the paltry wages and exorbitant costs of living and   hunger which have driven academic workers into struggle. But workers   have reported to the WSWS that UAW bargainers are already suggesting   they are ready to drop the demand for a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA)   to increase wages in line with inflation.  Anger  is mounting as  workers continue to be left in the dark about  bargaining. On Sunday  night, UAW bargainers canceled a planned  livestream bargaining session  for student researchers at the last  minute. The bargaining committee  arrogantly justified its secret talks  with management by declaring, ‚ÄúWe  had to close the zoom room because  the university wanted to have a chat  with our bargaining team before  writing an on-the-record proposal. The  university wanted to discuss  concepts that we proposed this past week as  part of our wage proposal.  We had a lot of questions for them, too. The  conversation was  productive, and we hope that this results in them  responding with an  actual proposal very soon.‚Äù  If the  bargainers  really represented striking students they would have  replied to  management‚Äôs request for backroom talks with the statement:   ‚ÄúYou can go  to hell. Anything you have to say to us, you can say in  front of our  membership.‚Äù  But  that is not what they did. Instead, they entered  into talks behind the  backs of striking workers. This shows the  contempt of the UAW apparatus  for rank-and-file workers. Livestreamed  talks are for show. When there  are issues of real substance, these will  be discussed behind closed  doors.  This only underscores the   necessity for striking workers at every campus to elect representatives   to a rank-and-file strike committee, which will oversee all   negotiations, ensure all talks are livestreamed, and empowers the   membership to countermand any undemocratic decisions to ram through a   bogus agreement, which ignores their essential needs.

    "self_text": "Hello, I currently go to UCR and am looking to transfer to ucla since it is closer to home and I have always wanted to go here. I am a biology major and have a 3.91 culm. And 4.0 bcpm gpa and should have a 3.93 gpa after I finish this quarter. I will have completed all of the recommended and required prereqs by spring. I was looking to transfer as another biology related major, this is where my question comes in:  I am debating on what to transfer into, I‚Äôm stuck between choosing my alternate major and I have 3 main options -    molecular and cell biology (39% acceptance with top 75% having a 3.93 gpa)  microbiology (34% acceptance rate with top 75% having a 3.93 gpa)   -ecology and evolution (13% acceptance rate with top 75% having a 3.76)  I am definitely going to put my first main major as cell biology as it has the highest acceptance rate but for the alternate major I am kind of stuck because micro has a good acceptance rate but high gpa and ecology has a significantly lower acceptance rate but a significantly lower gpa making it easier to stand out between the other applicants. I‚Äôm leaning towards micro just because of the acceptance rate but I would like to get your opinions.  Which alternative major do u think I should choose?",
