You're here studying ... whatever. Doing research on .... whatever. You're doing this because you're interested in learning it, for whatever reason - post-graduate academia or industry.   &#x200B;  You TA for one class (as far as I know), and you hold one 1-2 hour discussion section a week along with 2 hours of OH every week. On a different post, I saw a TA state that they work 15-20 hours a week. That's great. You get paid for 20 hours a week. There's 3 quarters, 10 weeks long, plus finals week, plus let's add a week after finals week just to be safe, that's 36 weeks total. You make approximately $26k for it. 26000/36/20 = $36/hr.  If you're a GSR, you get paid even more. You even get paid for your research. On top of that, your tuition is subsidized (as far as I'm aware, if you're in Engineering at least).  &#x200B;  You're a student, doing research (and getting paid for it), and working a part-time job besides (and getting paid quite heavily for it), and you want more.  &#x200B;  Again, you're a student. You signed up for this. You went to graduate school. You wanted this. In a few years, you'll reap the rewards. For now, this is your situation. You cannot expect more from this when this is a situation you put yourself in to further yourself in life. It's not about how expensive rent is. We all know rent in LA is expensive, but you put yourself here. Take some responsibility for your situation. It's benefiting you to be here, and deep down, you're doing it for no one else.  &#x200B;  You want to get paid more? For what? For rent? The solution there is to have the university offer housing, as it does for undergraduates, not an increased demand of $$$ for the amount (20 hrs/wk) that you work that you already get reimbursed for quite generously.  &#x200B;  This strike isn't taking anything away from you, but it's taking everything away from us undergraduates. For that reason, in my mind, you are all entitled, selfish pieces of shit. Convince me otherwise, but that's where I stand.",

    "self_text": "Today marks the third day of the strike by 48,000 academic workers throughout the University of California (UC) system. The strike involves  postdoctoral and academic researchers, tutors, graduate student  instructors and assistants in the United Auto Workers (UAW). The academic workers are demanding adequate pay and benefits to address the  immense and soaring cost of living in California.  The strike is already the  largest university strike in US history  and includes half of  the roughly 100,000 academic workers in the UAW. It is taking place as  more than 1,700 part-time faculty and UAW members at the New School in  New York City will begin a strike on Wednesday, joining the 250  HarperCollins workers already on strike in the city.  In an effort to smother opposition, the UC administration on the first day of the strike requested that a mediator be brought in. Ryan  King, a UC spokesperson, said in a statement Monday, ‚ÄúAt this time, we  believe that the best path to an agreement is with the aid of a third-party mediator.‚Äù  UAW officials have so far rejected the proposal for a mediator, but they have opened up the pickets to various Democratic politicians. The strike is, in fact, pitting academic workers in direct conflict with the Democratic Party, which controls the UC Board of Regents and California politics at the state and local level.  Reporters from the WSWS spoke with striking university workers, many of whom expressed concerns over the cost of living and intimidation from academic advisors. They also declared their solidarity with workers in  the humanities who are regularly paid less than their counterparts in  hard sciences.  Will and Richard, UC San Diego graduate students in the physics department, said workers were demanding a 100 percent increase in their wages. Will noted that he and his partner currently live in graduate student housing, but they are only guaranteed access to this housing for two years. When they are forced out of the lower-cost graduate student  housing, he said he could face a situation where rent consumes ‚Äú75 percent of my current salary, for a rent of $3,000 month.‚Äù Off-campus  housing also comes with the costs of commute, and he noted, ‚ÄúI cannot  afford gas and a car.‚Äù  Richard said, ‚ÄúI live in Santee, I cannot  even afford to live in San Diego.‚Äù Monthly, he brings home $2,500 and is concerned particularly for the high costs of insurance for himself and  his partner.  Richard also stressed the importance of academic accountability. ‚ÄúSomething I am passionate about is that I want to make  sure we get fair treatment for academic workers. Too many of my  colleagues have been gaslit or face deceit from their PIs [Principal  Investigators, or lead researcher in a grand project]. I‚Äôve seen PIs claim ownership over the work of grad students, and it‚Äôs absolutely unfair. There are no protections for academic workers. And grievances go nowhere.‚Äù  Megan, a second-year graduate student in psychology at UCSD, said that one of  the main reasons she is striking is because she wants to see more  protections given to academic workers, particularly at the hands of PIs.  ‚ÄúWe have no protections from academic bullying,‚Äù Megan said.

This makes enough sense, but then what is the point of having three additional required pre-major preparation classes? Does that just mean that you must do those 3 extra lower divs (or approved uper divs for premajor) sometime before you graduate? Thank you for the clarification, just confused.",

    "self_text": "This is a throwaway account.  I'm currently a senior majoring in chemistry, and to be honest, I've been miserable ever since I transferred to UCLA. The reason may sound stupid, but it all boils down to having a 4.0. Every quarter has been a stress-filled nightmare because of my GPA.   I know I don't need a GPA this high to reach my goals, but I'm so used to getting A's that it has taken over my life. I've grown to hate school because of it. Going to school isn't about learning anymore it's all about survival. There's no satisfaction in getting A's anymore. It feels like I'm playing Russian roulette and I happen to get lucky.  I don't get A's because I'm some sort of genius, but because I literally sit at my desk and study all day. As a result, I never made any new friends or accomplished any of my non-school-related goals. I have no experience other than school, I never volunteered, I never had a job, and I don't have research experience. If I apply to grad school they're just going to think of me as some lifeless robot.   This quarter has been different though. I'm starting to not care anymore and I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. I'm no longer on top of things and I'm constantly procrastinating. I'm literally sabotaging myself by doing the bare minimum and I've even gone to the GPA calculator to see how bad a C would affect me. I don't know if this behavior will carry on or if it's just my brain finally telling me that it's ok to not get an A. Will grad schools see this as a sign of weakness or will they see that I'm human?   I realize that I sound like a pretentious asshole even complaining about having a 4.0, but that title doesn't really mean anything to me. I don't think I'm better than anyone and I think everyone has potential. I feel like I'm ready to lose it, but at the same time, I feel like I'm not.",

I spent weeks studying for it: I sacrificed time with my friends and doing things that I enjoy so I could perform well. Your actions stated that my time, my energy, and my goals don't matter; it was essentially a \"fuck you\" of the highest magnitude.  As a student here, this university is my home. It is a place for me to grow as a person and a scholar. As such, I am entitled to a nurturing learning environment that enables the best for me. You undermined that.  How could highly educated men and women of learning, who are also responsible for teaching students, find it morally feasible to actively sabotage students' learning outcomes? If you really don't give a fuck about students and student outcomes, then perhaps you should not even be a TA.  *just to clarify, the strikers did not leave after barging in, but instead stayed in the hallway 5 feet away from the students, screaming and blaring their noise-makers during the midterm. Some things are minor inconveniences. This is not one of them.  (math midterm was in Bunche Hall from 10AM to 11AM).",

I'm pretty short (5ft) and skinny (110pounds) so any weight is pretty noticeable on me.

    "title": "The Flamin Hot Chicken Way üí™",
    "self_text": "The fine establishment that is Flamin Hot Chicken continues to awe me with their unprecedented customer service and willingness to go above and beyond.  This morning I noticed that they were on the schedule for lunch and I eagerly rushed down to order their food at opening time, only to be heartbroken by the fact that they were not there at 11. Thinking that I would have to settle for a Sproul food truck, I was delighted when I turned around and saw that Flamin Hot Chicken had just pulled into the Rieber driveway. And my oh my was I glad that I made this observation because the next hour would prove to be one of the best uses of time in my 4 quarter stint at UCLA.  I really admire the casual, down to Earth attitude of the employees, who were sitting in the truck for 20 minutes before deciding to open their windows. Once this happened, the customers were greeted by the wonderful sight of the employees unboxing rubber gloves and fries, which ultimately begs the question: wtf were they doing for the past 20 minutes? But who am I to judge perfection. Perfection takes time and this was really shown by them waiting until 11:30 to open orders and serving the very first order of the day at 11:42.  When I received my order of chicken tenders (plural on the menu) at 11:48, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I had received one (singular) chicken tender.  Another thing I love about the truck is their self-awareness; they know that their food is to die for and there will always be a line no matter what. As a result, Flamin Hot Chicken does not conform to your schedule or the school's designated schedule. You conform to their schedule, which is exemplified by the fact that they consistently manage to close their service 30 minutes before their allotted time. These abbreviated hours really add to the dining experience because it makes you feel as if you are a part of a special group if they deem you worthy enough to place an order.  Anyone else appreciate this superior behavior?",

    "self_text": "I'm seeing a lot of posts asking about picket lines and what is and is not considered crossing the picket line. Here's a quick list of dos and don'ts that you can follow as non-union folks:   DO:    Join the picket line - it's every day from 8 am to 5 pm and you can find out where the nearest picket is here  Tell academic workers that you're aware of the strike and support them  Ask professors to cancel classes, assignments, or exams (or at least postpone until the strike is over)   Flood tip lines about canceled classes with fake information  Sign the community letter of support that you can find here (for undergrad students) and here (for other community members)  Donate to the hardship fund here. This fund will be used for striking workers who will experience hardship as a result of lost wages and the strike pay cannot fully support them.  If you're an alum, cancel any recurring donations to the UC and tell them you're canceling the donation in solidarity with the strike. You can also just call the alumni relations office and tell them you support the strike.  Raise awareness! Share on social media. You can follow the unions on IG and TikTok here: @ uaw2865, @ uaw5810, @ fairucnow, and @ sruuaw    DON'T:    Interact with any UC survey or report canceled classes  Go to class in person or on Zoom  Use campus services (libraries, tutors, parking etc.)  Email your TAs about course-related questions or material  Go into academic buildings during picketing hours (8 am - 5pm)  Buy anything from the UC (game tickets, student store, etc.)   &#x200B;  By no means is this an exhaustive list, but this probably answers a lot of the questions that I've been seeing floating around. You also don't have to do every item on the list. People have special circumstances that prevent them from doing so. But even doing one of these things can help show solidarity and also further pressure the UC.",

I‚Äôve copied a previous comment I made which includes information regarding the strike‚Äîas well as how we got to this point.  There are copious documents, outlines and discussions on what UC has done to warrant a strike. This strike is a federally protected strike as UC has acted illegally in bargaining‚Äîwhich is why UC won‚Äôt attempt to stop it even though there is an anti strike clause (because they know it‚Äôs protected and they broke the law).  Document explaining the disparities of the unions‚Äô demands and UC‚Äôs offers: https://www.fairucnow.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/UCOP-Update-Response-2022-11-10.pdf  UAW Powerpoint outlining the purpose of the strike and what UAW does: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11AsUP9NcVjirdWlIMxRX3IS8zxk-AcAo6chbxzNPfzs/edit  In short the reasons for the strike include:  -UC made unilateral changes to working conditions without negotiating  -UC refused to provide necessary information for negotiations  -UC obstructed the bargaining process (this contract has been in bargaining for over a year now) through failures to show up, deliberate attempts to mislead and stall as well as coming completely unprepared to bargaining meetings.  As a result, Academic Workers have filed 27 charges against UC with the Public Employee Relations Board (PERB), that status of which (and exact charges) can be seen here: https://www.fairucnow.org/ulp/",

I physically can‚Äôt enroll in 100A until I‚Äôm officially pre-cog sci, and I didn‚Äôt have access to 85 first pass, so they both filled, and since 100B requires 100A that class it out of the question.  I‚Äôm done with all my GEs and Language recs, so my only options are either.    Take 3 coding courses in 3 different languages (C++, Python, Java) for the specialization in computing (which people told me was a stupid decision).

    "self_text": "For info I‚Äôm a 4th year. I usually spend my time with my boyfriend, or my best friend. It‚Äôs always made me content. I didn‚Äôt need more, though I‚Äôve always taken every opportunity to connect with other people too (parties / socials). I have acquaintances but I only ever vibe with or talk to when we‚Äôre both drunk. (I got to enough parties where I see the same people everytime) So when I‚Äôm lonely and sober I feel uneasy asking to hang out (i‚Äôm pretty introverted). Anyway here is the main problem, my best friend found herself a bf and I‚Äôve tried many times to reach out to her but she‚Äôs ghosted me/ politely rejected me bc she spends all her time with her bf now. She honestly was kinda my everything. Like we always hung out together and if I ever felt lonely, if she was free, we‚Äôd decide to go on adventures. And i‚Äôd do the same when she felt lonely. But since she got into this new relationship, I feel forgotten. I feel like nothing to her. I stopped reaching out a month ago and she never contacted me again. It really hurts. But at the same time, I‚Äôve talked to other people who know her, and they told me it‚Äôs not worth begging for her attention and telling her how I feel because she doesn‚Äôt deserve it. She is obsessing a lot over her bf and some of her other friends have pointed that out to her but she doesn‚Äôt see the implications. (It‚Äôs also her first relationship so I understand that she‚Äôs new to how to manage her time with other people). I also dont want to feel rejected again: ie asking to hang out to talk and she‚Äôll decline / or me telling her my feelings and having her not understand bc she‚Äôs all over her bf. Anyway, now I only have my bf. I feel like Im increasingly becoming dependent on his attention, so when he is busy, I feel lonely, and I‚Äôm reminded of the loss of my friend. And it sometimes upsets me that he‚Äôs busy altho im aware I shouldn‚Äôt blame him for this new dependance i have on him. I dont really know what to do.  I could try to become closer to my acquaintances but I don‚Äôt know how to approach them sober, or maybe it‚Äôs more that I lack the courage to ask.  Anyway, I‚Äôd appreciate your thoughts or advice.",

    "self_text": "A few hours ago, on November 8, 7:10ish PM, I went with my friends to DeNeve Dining Hall. The activity level was around 70-80% according to the UCLA Dining website, so, objectively, it was bound to be crowded. And indeed it was. A modest line stretched from the swiping desk and towards the lockers. Due to my failure to properly circumvent the crowd, I became separated from my friends and ended up around 5 people ahead of them. A lady, and the only swiper for the night, on the desk to the left swiped me in, and I stepped toward the right to wait for my friends to be swiped in, even peeking toward the right side of the dining hall to see if there were any open tables. My friends were swiped in, and I walked over to them, ready to head deeper into the dining hall. However, the lady stopped me, saying: ‚ÄúI saw you standing on the right. Go back in line and swipe again.‚Äù  I asked her: ‚ÄúDo you not remember me? You just swiped me in less than 2 minutes ago.‚Äù  ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she replied. Exasperated, she took my card and swiped again, showing how I had no swipes left for today‚Äôs dinner, and therefore cannot enter the dining hall. At this point, I must add that I have a 14R meal plan.  ‚ÄúWell, of course she has no swipes left for tonight, you can see that she is on a Regular plan, and you had just swiped her in,‚Äù countered my friends.   I repeated my plea, insisting that she remember swiping me in less than two minutes ago, but she repeated her argument that she saw me lingering to the right of the line to justify her actions. The lady said that my friends could swipe me in or I was to leave. To be frank, I find this baffling, as why would she assume an elaborate scheme orchestrated by me and my friends to sneak one person in? Why would someone swipe in TWICE a night into a DINING HALL? Why would you look at a person in the eye, shaking with insistence and pleading if you remember her, clearly so hungry, and accuse them of lying and turn them away from a meal?  Not wanting to worry my friends and not wanting to further hold up the long line, I turned around and left. I had been complaining of cold and hunger since 5:30 PM and had not had a proper meal for today, so I returned to my dorm, unable to swipe for food again tonight, pretty sad and tired.   I have no way to gain back a swipe, to prove what had happened (besides camera footage), or to prove something to that lady, and nor do I particularly wish for anything in reparation, but that truth irks me.   Though, it would be nice if workers swiping students in could check how long ago the students had swiped in/where they did so that something unfortunate and avoidable like this can never happen to another person.",

I'm so incredibly grateful to be able to go to school and receive an education, so i have a lot of guilt about being miserable in los angeles. i don't get why so many people adore LA, but i guess i can understand the appeal of being in a bustling city. i know, I should've thought about the city around the university before I committed- and i did, which makes it worse, because i thought i'd be okay. i guess I'm writing this to see if anyone can relate and find ways to cope. i love my roommates, my apartment, my classes, my professors, and I'm grateful for all the opportunities im presented with here, but the environment makes it really hard to fully enjoy everything :(",

I think the disparity between the incomes of the individuals running UCs and the teaching staff (TAs, lecturers, professors, and more) is absurd.

UC already has our tuition for the quarter, and yet the undergraduate student body is going to suffer class and discussion cancelations, and an overall truncated education.  In a time of already great uncertainty and anxiety, midterms are being delayed/canceled.  Could there have been a better way to negotiate fair wages?  Furthermore, if increased TA wages come at the cost of increased tuition, then where should the undergraduate students stand on this?  Why should we be made to pay to amend the injustice the university is levying on them?  At the end of the day I‚Äôm feeling incredibly mixed on this issue.  I‚Äôm with the TAs for demanding better pay from the UC, but seeing as those burdens will likely fall on the undergraduate body, I‚Äôm hesitant about the entire issue.",

I mean zero complaints, something is up, no matter where your living someone is bitching about something. I feel like I'll  get more real and raw answers here. so to anyone who lived or had any experience with zuma housing what are some honest reviews. And if it  happens to be a shithole, any recommendations on other spots that suite what I'm looking for.

Last week he dropped a bomb and said that we would not only have a take-home essay but also an in-class final exam too.

    "title": "Grad student thoughts on the strike",
    "self_text": "Hi all, I am a graduate student who is striking and wanted to offer some thoughts about why we are striking and clarify some confusion that I've seen.  Why are we striking? Rent in Los Angeles is expensive and only increasing. The UC offers housing to us, but they charge us something close to the market rate (and it's arguably even more pricey). When I lived in UC grad housing, nearly 70% of my paycheck immediately went back to the UC for rent and other living expenses. Food, gas, household goods, other random fees, etc all are very expensive in LA and add up to make it an extremely tight budget. \"Rent burden\" is defined as spending over 30% of your income on rent, and  over 90% of UC grad students are rent burdened . I don't know somebody who pays less than half their budget in rent, let alone 30%. Those who are not technically rent burdened likely live in a distant part of LA and have to make a great commute. It's not possible to live where we work with the low pay that UC gives us.  Low wages are also an issue of equity. I am thankfully able to stay in my program because of money I previously saved up and with help from my family, but  students from other economic backgrounds would be forced out of the program . Talented grad students and postdocs who cannot afford to live here just don't come, and those that do come encounter immediate difficulties with low wages. It's not that we want to make a lot of money -- it's that  our current wage is fundamentally unlivable . The UC has called our demands for a livable wage \"exorbitant.\" But guess what? The UC President makes 1M a year and lives in a 55 room mansion. Talk about exorbitant. UC grad students & postdocs comprise 20% of the UC workforce, yet make only 1% of the total income. We are proposing to collectively make 3% of the income.   I personally want to do my research during this time , as do most of us, since once we graduate we will be hired based on research output. However, this temporary disruption of teaching and research is necessary for the greater good. The vast majority of grad students love teaching and research -- it's why we choose to go into academia over getting a more lucrative job.  We are workers who have Bachelor's degrees and have already been through undergrad , and many of our friends from undergrad literally make 10x more than us. But what we do is work, and our labor in classes and research produces most of the university's value. We are the ones grading the assignments and performing the experiments, not the professors.  If you hear that we are \"part-time students\", that is propaganda on behalf of the admin . PhD students are classified as either employees or students at any given time depending on what is most financially beneficial for the administration. We are paid at \"50%\", which is a tool of propaganda, because the other 50% is spent doing more research for the university and nearly every PhD student works way more than 40 hours per week. Postdocs are also full-time researchers who already have PhDs and are certainly not students in any capacity. While PhD students do take classes for ~2 years, we are expected to work full time outside of that for several years on the teaching and research that produces value for the university. Note that unlike other graduate degrees (e.g. med school), PhD students that remain in academia generally do not make enough money post-PhD to compensate for any financial hardships suffered now. We are workers now and deserve livable compensation for that work.  Many of us were undergraduates just a matter of years ago. Since we are all in graduate school now, it's safe to say that most of us were also concerned about our academics at the time, so we understand the undergrads' concerns about their education being disrupted. When I was an undergrad, my TAs went on strike and my grades were fine, I promise. However,  please direct any complaints to the UC administration  (without naming any strikers by name). Tell them that your education is being disrupted by the UC's unwillingness to bargain with us in good faith and offer us a livable wage. Like I mentioned,  my own research and classes are being disrupted too , which are things I care about because that's how I will be hired down the road. But the entire point of a strike is to be as disruptive as possible to every university function. Generally speaking, if everyone else at the university was happy, we would never win. Our goal is to place pressure on undergrads and faculty to in turn pressure the admin.  The more disruptive a strike is, the more effective . This has been the case for labor movements forever, and our current strike is one of the largest in history. It has the potential to change working conditions not just at UC, but in higher education and in the workforce that you will enter upon graduation.",

My whole purpose of transferring was to have pure Computer Science, however at UCSC, they don't let anyone switch into CS unless your admitted as is. With UCLA, since I did not finish my physics lower div requirements, my only option was Ling and CS, but then I realized that I did not do my Letter of Reciprocity at UCSC, meaning I would also have to take extra GE classes.

I‚Äôve made a DPO complaint about this Professor earlier this month. I‚Äôve reached out to the head of the English department about the hostile environment of this department. I‚Äôm at my wits end. This man told us to make our own Ask a Mexican columns and insert our race or identity in place of the word Mexican. This gave the professor the opportunity to insert his own tasteless jokes like ‚ÄúIf Indians are so good at math how come they never heard of overpopulation?‚Äù This is an English class. Why am I being subjected to this ignorance and racism? When talking about Charles Burnett‚Äôs Killer of Sheep today the professor asked if Blaxploitation films are another example of independent Black film making?!?!

Give my details below, thanks in advance :)   CGPA:  9.6 -- CS Dept as well as University Gold Medallist (i.e. highest GPA across all Depts)   UG College:  Tier 1 college(one of the Top 5 NITs) -- 2020 grad   GRE:  318 (150V and 168Q) -- Messed up GRE so only submitting to  Gatech ,  CMU,  and  UCSD  where it is mandatory   TOEFL:  111   Internships:    SDE Intern at one of the Top IITs after 2nd year BTech  SDE Intern at one of the top Investment Banks after 3rd year BTech    Work Ex:  2.5 years as SDE at the same Investment Bank where I interned (got PPO). Have some nice projects related to systems which is the field I'm applying to.   Research:  1 research paper was published but it's not relevant to the field I'm applying to so wouldn't matter much. Paper came out of a project I was leading at work. The research paper is on programming languages.   LOR:  Getting 3 strong LORs, two from top profs at my college and one from my manager at work. One of the profs giving LOR has been a  guest lecturer at Purdue CS Dept , so hoping would have a good shot at Purdue   Now for the universities, I'm applying to:     Ambitious:  Stanford, CMU,  UCLA , UT Austin, Gatech. [doubtful to apply to UIUC and Michigan Ann Arbour]   Moderate:  UC SD, Columbia, Purdue. [doubtful to apply to UPenn, NYU Courant]   Safe:  USC (Since it is CGPA Centric). [doubtful to apply to Wisconsin Madison UMass]   Let me know what you guys think and feel free to suggest modifications or share any information/reservations you have about these universities which I should know before applying. Thanks !!!",

I especially want to contribute to something involving coding and CS but I've only just begun learning and I feel like I can't rly compete with other experienced programmers. And research/work directly in the Math department seems hard cuz I don't see how I'll contribute without already having a grasp of advanced/upper div content (which I'm not at yet).  How do I get research/internships at this point? Does anyone have experience? I'm concerned I won't have enough to get into grad school for CS/Math if I don't start soon.  If anything I'm gonna self-study programming and work on personal coding projects to have something presentable at least. I'm going to go to office hours to talk to TAs and professors so hopefully that'll help too. But irdk how to get started",

You're here studying ... whatever. Doing research on .... whatever. You're doing this because you're interested in learning it, for whatever reason - post-graduate academia or industry.  You TA for one class (as far as I know), and you hold one 1-2 hour discussion section a week along with 2 hours of OH every week. On a different post, I saw a TA state that they work 15-20 hours a week. That's great. You get paid for 20 hours a week. There's 3 quarters, 10 weeks long, plus finals week, plus let's add a week after finals week just to be safe, that's 36 weeks total. You make approximately $26k for it. 26000/36/20 = $36/hr. If you're a GSR, you get paid even more. You even get paid for your research. On top of that, your tuition is subsidized (as far as I'm aware, if you're in Engineering at least).  You're a student, doing research (and getting paid for it), and working a part-time job besides (and getting paid quite heavily for it), and you want more.  Again, you're a student. You signed up for this. You went to graduate school. You wanted this. In a few years, you'll reap the rewards. For now, this is your situation. You cannot expect more from this when this is a situation you put yourself in to further yourself in life. It's not about how expensive rent is. We all know rent in LA is expensive, but you put yourself here. Take some responsibility for your situation. It's benefiting you to be here, and deep down, you're doing it for no one else.  You want to get paid more? For what? For rent? The solution there is to have the university offer housing, as it does for undergraduates, not an increased demand of $$$ for the amount (20 hrs/wk) that you work that you already get reimbursed for quite generously.  This strike isn't taking anything away from you, but it's taking everything away from us undergraduates. For that reason, in my mind, this strike is a completely entitled, selfish thing to do. Convince me otherwise, but that's where I stand.",

Redistribute to graduate students and academic researchers ‚Äî preserve the strike fund as long as possible.  The university cannot respond in kind. What will they do, revoke access to dining halls? Forbid hungry students from eating? Their bloated and ugly officials have administrated themselves into a corner. Dorms are not designed for sustainable living ‚Äî there is a single kitchen for fifteen thousand students. Most on campus housing does not receive direct sunlight. Fluorescent lighting glares at residents 24/7 while it dewires circadian rhythms.   The University has contracted gas guzzling fast food trucks while they limit meat availability for performative, misdirected environmental concern. It‚Äôs not as though the professors, leaders in their fields, are ignorant, as Professor Mitloehner of the Clarity and Leadership for Environmental Awareness and Research (CLEAR) Center at UC Davis states, ‚Äúanimal agriculture emits no net methane‚Äù ‚Äì the energy industry fuels all atmospheric carbon increase ‚Äì through fossils, and through funds, such as BP‚Äôs marketing campaign to popularize the notion of the individual carbon footprint. Rather, the administration and all its nefarious offshoots are concerned with moral marketing optics at the expense of a functional, beautiful community of student and teacher.   UCLA spends hundreds of thousands of dollars employing staff at the Black Community Center to hang up posters of Malcolm X and Tiger Woods and order Papa Johns for bored black students. All, of course, not from a legitimate drive to increase the quality of their education but to gain more black applicants for a diversity quota. All, of course, at the expense of the disadvantaged grad students who are disproportionately black.   If Nancy Pepsi can acquire $140 million, why can‚Äôt she guarantee a livable wage for California educators?   If UC can buy a mansion for President Drake, why can‚Äôt they alleviate rent insecurity for the employees upon whom their corpulent mass resides?  There‚Äôs a brand new digital billboard in Bruin Plaza ‚Äî $100,000 for light pollution. Whichever employee thought of that, whichever higher management approved, liquidate their salaries and redistribute the savings.   Prepare food for the picketers. Give the chancellor his just deserts.  Share your love with the union. Send contempt to the state. Live alongside the strike. Die without regret.   Unlike the capitalists of old, the UC administration is neither sufficiently cold nor capable to break this strike. If we dedicate ourselves to the cause, triumph is inevitable.",

And my extracurriculars are pretty standard:   Improv club (2 years)  Yearbook club (senior year)  And I might ask my 3D printing teacher if I can join STEM club since they like to see your major and EC‚Äôs have a connection   And I don‚Äôt have any leadership positions or community service hours. It‚Äôs probably too late now :(   So yeah, the thought makes me sad but we‚Äôll see.  I also have a question, what is a less competitive version of computer science at the UCs? Since UCLA is one of my dream schools.   Sorry this was so long.",

I hear this talk of rent, but there are no actual numbers, instead all of the protesting docs I've seen seem to flout that it's more than >%30 of their wage that goes to rent, which in LA, is not exactly unreasonable; rent in LA is pretty expensive.  - How will this affect final grades and classes?  &#x200B;  Questions answered: Ta's work about 20 hours a week and sometimes less on classes. Rest is research (which they say they deserve pay for as it makes the school money). Make about $800/wk (someone down there said). That's about $40/hr (or more) for classes TA'd.

    "title": "University of California strike begins second week: ‚ÄúWe need a society that works for everyone, not just the capitalists at the top‚Äù",
    "self_text": "Today  marks the beginning of the second week of the strike by 48,000   academic workers in the University of California (UC) system. The action   is the largest strike of academic workers in United States history,   pitting graduate student instructors (GSIs), postdocs, researchers and   other academic workers against the Democratic Party-controlled UC   administration and Board of Regents.  The  strikers, who are members of the three different locals of the  United  Auto Workers (UAW) union, are demanding a 100 percent salary   increase‚Äîfrom an impossibly low $24,000 a year to $54,000‚Äîto address   California‚Äôs skyrocketing rents and other living expenses. The strike   has galvanized workers throughout UC‚Äôs 10 campuses and far more broadly.  The UAW bureaucracy is attempting to smother the strike as it did the 2020 wildcat strike   and grade boycott by limiting the action to an ‚ÄúUnfair Labor Practice‚Äù   work stoppage, not a strike over economic demands. This would allow  the  UAW bureaucracy to shut the strike down any time it claims  management  has resumed ‚Äúgood faith negotiations,‚Äù even if UC  administrators  continue to reject the workers‚Äô just economic demands.  However,   it is precisely the paltry wages and exorbitant costs of living and   hunger which have driven academic workers into struggle. But workers   have reported to the WSWS that UAW bargainers are already suggesting   they are ready to drop the demand for a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA)   to increase wages in line with inflation.  Anger  is mounting as  workers continue to be left in the dark about  bargaining. On Sunday  night, UAW bargainers canceled a planned  livestream bargaining session  for student researchers at the last  minute. The bargaining committee  arrogantly justified its secret talks  with management by declaring, ‚ÄúWe  had to close the zoom room because  the university wanted to have a chat  with our bargaining team before  writing an on-the-record proposal. The  university wanted to discuss  concepts that we proposed this past week as  part of our wage proposal.  We had a lot of questions for them, too. The  conversation was  productive, and we hope that this results in them  responding with an  actual proposal very soon.‚Äù  If the  bargainers  really represented striking students they would have  replied to  management‚Äôs request for backroom talks with the statement:   ‚ÄúYou can go  to hell. Anything you have to say to us, you can say in  front of our  membership.‚Äù  But  that is not what they did. Instead, they entered  into talks behind the  backs of striking workers. This shows the  contempt of the UAW apparatus  for rank-and-file workers. Livestreamed  talks are for show. When there  are issues of real substance, these will  be discussed behind closed  doors.  This only underscores the   necessity for striking workers at every campus to elect representatives   to a rank-and-file strike committee, which will oversee all   negotiations, ensure all talks are livestreamed, and empowers the   membership to countermand any undemocratic decisions to ram through a   bogus agreement, which ignores their essential needs.

My current GPA in Junior year is 3.24 unweighted and 4.2 weighted, my PSAT that year was 1260 and I waiting for the one this year, I feel I did way better so I am expecting a higher score. This year so far I have done way better since I have gotten used to the migraines and I have dealt with my depression to the best of my abilities. I have gotten almost all ‚ÄúA‚Äùs except for one ‚ÄúB‚Äù this past quarter for a mistake I made. I am expecting to get all A this quarter and the rest or close enough to that goal. I am taking two APs and one honors this year and have take some slightly easier classes in case I hadn‚Äôt been able to deal with my migraines. I expect to take some more APs next years. I am positive I can get higher than a 3.4 GPA before my senior year starts. Are my chances of getting into UCLA possible?

Why exactly is there this expectation that they be paid more for this little work that they do when they are students too and here for their own benefit? They even get their tuition subsidized (in Engineering) as far as I know.   It‚Äôs kind of ridiculous to ask for more than that. You‚Äôre pursuing your Master‚Äôs/PhD and have this part time job on the side where you‚Äôre making good money per the hour (more than most people ever make). Why is there this expectation of more?

I've had many tell me I should start a mini side practice because people would be interested. The prices would obviously not be ridiculously high since I am still practicing, and doing it for fun! Was thinking of maybe doing $10-15 gel manicures (depending on designs and all that), and gel X sets for $25-35 (also depending on length and difficulty of designs). Please let me know if anyone would be genuinely interested!  &#x200B;  Edit: Thank you guys for your interest! I will most likely end up going through with it! I am thinking of starting next quarter, just to ensure I bring all of my materials and supplies from home and because of finals season as well! Ill definitely keep you guys updated!!

However, starting these past few weeks, I did not have a good sleep at all. Neighbors‚Äô stomping noises have been progressively louder at 7 am and sometimes at 2 am. It might not be intentional, but who keeps walking in a tiny apartment for 30 minutes with 1-2 minute intervals in between? It has been happening recently, and my roommate has noticed it too. Sometimes, we wake up at 4 am because of the loud noise of some hard objects falling, followed by a giggle. I‚Äôm not sure why this has been happening, but I think that it was a response to the conversations I had with my roommate in our room. We tend to have a chat at like 11 pm when studying is done, but it was not our intention to disturb them in any kind. We‚Äôre just socializing in these tough past weeks ü•≤  I put on noise-canceling headphones with white noise throughout my sleep. I woke up with a ringing in my ear. I'm hesitant to use earplugs because I might not be able to hear my alarm (which happened before). I want to write a note or chat, but what if it worsens? I mean, I had already loudly knocked on the ceiling to make them aware, yet they didn't get the signal. It only got more consistent.   Any advice to alleviate my situation will be helpful!!",

I finally started writing my Multiple Withdrawals Appeal to explain the 2 quarters I failed last year. But I just saw a MyUCLA notice from a month ago saying I'm dismissed from the university.  I'm kinda panicking because the deadline is in two days (November 25th), and there aren't any counselors available by then. I met a counselor way back in March, when I was planning to submit a Multiple Withdrawals Appeal. Now that I'm dealing with a dismissal , I'm worried that the school will view my appeal poorly because I didn't seek help regarding my dismissal.  I was looking for advice from anyone who's succesfully appealed for dismissal. I'm wondering if it matters whether I saw a counselor, as long as my appeal demonstrates that I've taken action and grown in other ways..   Any help would be appreciated!  tldr: can't see a counselor before submitting my dismissal appeal. scared that this will greatly lower my chances of being readmitted. looking for advice/experience",

    "self_text": "I fully supported the staff strike that occurred last year. Those university employees are significantly underpaid and, in my view, were taken advantage of by the university. They also work full time jobs. These are people's (potentially life-long) careers and they deserve commensurate compensation for themselves and their families. I also fully believe that lecturers here are significantly underpaid and mistreated while essentially doing the same job as full-time professors. But I'm more conflicted about striking of TAs and GSRs.  24k is an unacceptable amount to pay someone for a full time job -- but being a TA is not a full time job. As others on this sub have attested, the workload varies from 15-20 hours a week, which means most TA's hourly compensation is actually excellent. The vast majority of grad student's tuition is also covered by the university in exchange for research. Ostensibly, the tuition for these programs would normally run somewhere between 20-50k. Therefore we can deduce that most TA's really make between 45-75k a year, assuming their grad programs' tuition is covered.  Getting a PhD/Masters is also a privilege: these degrees usually to high-paying, even lucrative careers. No one is forcing anyone to go to grad school -- people apply here on their own whim to study, do research, graduate and then advance their professional careers (and make money). TA jobs are transitory (not permanent) jobs, and grad students get them without any prior teaching experience. Grad school is also out of reach for the vast majority of Americans: most people need to start their professional careers immediately out of undergrad (or graduate with student loan debt). Many people work low paying public service jobs or join the military to get government aid to subsidize their grad school education.  In my opinion, there is a distinction between underrepresented blue-collar workers striking for fair treatment and compensation, and graduate students demanding more pay for what is essentially part time work. I fully believe graduate students are essential to the function of the university, and maybe they should be paid more than 24k. I'm sympathetic to grad students who struggle financially. However I'm not sure the current salary demand of 55k for 15-20 hours of work per week is a realistic or fair ask (the post-doc lecturer pay demand of 70k I fully agree with).  Please let me know if I'm misinformed...",

I struggle w anxiety and panic disorder and she‚Äôd yell at me for various things that are really small [im afraid to go into detail in the case she sees this] it‚Äôs gotten to the point where she yelled at me in front of our other housemates to the point where I cried in which she mocked me when I tried to speak, my roommate tried helping but she‚Äôd yell at her too. (this is when I realized bystander effect is real bc my other housemates watched it happen and didn‚Äôt do anything, of course I wouldn‚Äôt get involved either if it didn‚Äôt include me but it hurt to see no one had our back).   I reached out to the RA, they scheduled a ‚Äúmediated‚Äù meeting for the 4 of us (my roommate and I, her and her roommate) tomorrow. I‚Äôm scared and have been avoiding home just bouncing from friends apts.   The point of this is, any RA‚Äôs or people who work with housing have any advice on how I can room swap before the room swap event in jan?   I know she needs to threaten my safety in order for me to leave ASAP, but she knows this as well and at most has followed me around the apt, other than that it‚Äôs mostly verbal.   I can‚Äôt sleep, I can‚Äôt eat here. We share a bathroom and I‚Äôm scared to use it. I‚Äôve never felt so backed into a corner, I‚Äôd appreciate any advice.",

Genuinely. Locked myself in for 5 days straight and probably studied an upwards of 40 hours. I was confident going into this exam that I would do better than I did in econ11.  I was in the bottom 15% of scores.  What do I do? I thought I liked the challenge of the major, but I‚Äôve come to realize I‚Äôm genuinely terrible at math and can‚Äôt keep up. I like the allure of the major because it is challenging, and it isn‚Äôt just really easy like I know some other majors would be for me. I want a major that will at least be versatile, and possibly get me a job out of college. I just don‚Äôt know what to do, and am really dejected and lost right now. I don‚Äôt want to drop the business part of econ either, because that was the only reason I was willing to do econ.   Please, if anyone has advice, I really would love to hear. I will meet with an academic advisor also, but I just thought I‚Äôd ask here first.",

However, I am going to be working at a lab for 12 hours a week, and I'll be volunteering at a hospital for 6 hours a week (until February, when I will be volunteering 8 hours per week).   Therefore, do y'all think its wise to take four classes in this quarter, or should I only take 3? In the case that I take 3 classes, I would take off CHEM14BL, but I understand that CHEM14B and CHEM14BL are usually taken together, which is why I'm in a sort of dilemma here.

    "self_text": "Opposition   among striking academic workers at the University of California   continues to grow against any efforts by United Auto Workers bargainers   to abandon their core demands. On November 14, 48,000 teaching   assistants, lecturers, researchers and other academic workers walked out   to demand substantial raises, cost-of-living protection (COLA),   increased parental leave and other improvements.  Last   week, UAW bargaining teams announced in online caucus meetings that   they had dropped the demand for COLA. In response, numerous   rank-and-file workers began angrily shouting ‚ÄúNo COLA, No Contract‚Äù   before UAW officials muted them and rapidly shut down the meeting. Many   strikers also called for the replacement of the bargaining team.  On   Thanksgiving day, when pickets were closed for the holiday, UAW Local   5810‚Äôs bargaining team released a video on Twitter claiming that ‚ÄúUC  has  finally made a serious offer to Postdocs that addresses major   concerns.‚Äù Bargaining members hailed a proposed increase in parental   leave from 4 to 8 weeks and an $11,000 pay increase for postdocs by   October 2023.  But several aspects   of these claims are misleading. Under California law, parents are   eligible for 60‚Äì70 percent of their income via the Paid Family Leave   (PFL) for up to 8 weeks. This means the UC proposal simply puts them in   compliance with state policy. As for the salary increase, this would   quickly be eaten up by the soaring cost of living. California consumer   prices jumped 13.9 percent between January 2021 and October 2022,   according to the Congressional Joint Economic Committee.  A   statement signed by 27 members of the UAW Local 2865 and Student   Researchers United-UAW bargaining team acknowledges the widespread   opposition to the dropping of the COLA demand and tries to defend this   abject capitulation. Arguments from ‚Äúsome of our colleagues‚Äù that ‚Äúit is   too soon, and our strike is too strong, for us to ‚Äòstart conceding,‚Äô‚Äù   are misplaced and the result of failing to understand the ‚Äúgive and   take‚Äù of the bargaining process. Moreover, strikers are being   unrealistic if not selfish, they suggest, for demanding ‚Äúopen-ended‚Äù   wage increases.  Read the rest:  https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2022/11/29/xrei-n29.html",

Can't actually tell your therapist how you're feeling cuz if you get too honest you get chucked into rubber pencil prison.   And institutions actually have the gall to get others involved, saying you're a hero for reporting someone's suicidal feelings and \"saving their life\".  The patronizing attitude of so-called friends who think they care about me and are doing me a favor by reporting it is so revolting and self-righteous it makes me want to vomit. I'm already drowning in work, and if you just sic the cops on me instead of letting me talk about it, you're personally damning me. You didn't save my life you ruined my death. I know I'm not the only one feeling this, I've heard about other people who were too honest about their suicidal ideation and had the cops come \"just to check.\" This needs to change.",

I could tell this guy gave no fucks about fashion when I looked at the crusty monstrosities that covered his feet. No this man was an absolute academic weapon. Whats more he fucking sat in the disability seating in an effort to prevent cheating I assume but the teacher made him move.

This evening, she just sent an email EXCLUDING all graduate students at the School of Music essentially telling students to not strike unless they want to face negative repercussions... thoughts?  &#x200B;   Edit : The part that I found concerning was #1) That the dean excluded ALL graduate students from this email, not just those with TAships or under GSR pay and #2) the following section of her email:   \"As a citizen, you can clearly act as you see fit.  Your rights as a citizen, however, do not obviate your obligations as contracted and paid employees of the University.   You are expected to be in class and to perform the duties for which the university pays you.¬†Ladder faculty are contracted as salaried employees for nine months and include an agreed-upon number of courses as assigned by your chair. Temporary faculty/lecturers are hired and paid for the specific work of delivering the classes for which you were contracted.¬†   The canceling of classes by anyone under contract to deliver them will be treated as absenteeism in violation of your work agreement.  The University and campus have the right to dock your pay should you not perform the duties to which you agreed when you signed your employment agreement.\"  This was surprising to me as many other departments didn't specifically discourage faculty support of the strike in their emails, and I know many professors who have already cancelled lectures in support of their TAs.  https://preview.redd.it/rw7q5ur48vz91.png?width=1262&format=png&auto=webp&s=426dcf97564e589fac2258f7232b25995d7d46dd  https://preview.redd.it/5cj8uir48vz91.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=b792ba2c6a554bbfa88b934448020e55d67073ae  https://preview.redd.it/k7sxj4s48vz91.png?width=1178&format=png&auto=webp&s=648b7652bee43c497a9dc2f92f47e19167b59204  https://preview.redd.it/y4v4z2s48vz91.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff1b5bcae53b6f96b56b120d4e9caf90956913d2  https://preview.redd.it/fcaybir48vz91.png?width=1220&format=png&auto=webp&s=74c1daf41987c1cb1fc8ea1da7425fd0cd865b68",

Then there was a mask grab by one of the USC players that really looked like it twisted the head of one of our guys. Is it also normal for stalling to take a knee after the hike at the end? One more thing being that it seemed their coach also just up and left the post-game conference mid-question. I'm trying to rationalize that this was a solid respectable rivalry game and I was even excited during it (being more of a computer fella), but these things keep popping up now that make me feel like it was almost dirty.

I just have a question for everyone who thinks that TAs don‚Äôt deserve more money: Should all TAs just quit then? I‚Äôve seen many posts saying that TAs already earn more than enough at ‚Äú$36/hr‚Äù and that they knew what they were getting into when they signed up for this.   The common rhetoric is that they should just get a better paying job if this one isn‚Äôt enough to support cost of living in LA. So do you all just want TAs to quit and find better work elsewhere? There are PLENTY of jobs that would pay more, especially for people with the job experience and degrees that most of our TAs have, but TAs choose to work here because we need them. I‚Äôm sure everyone would be pissed if every TA quit because that would be exponentially worse than a strike that is doubtful to last longer than a month.   I‚Äôd like to clarify that I 100% support TAs getting a pay raise by any means necessary. Am I bummed that there will be a strike that will certainly negatively impact my education? Yes. Does that mean that the strike shouldn‚Äôt happen? No. It‚Äôs supposed to piss off undergrads and their parents. But you all are getting mad at the wrong people. Get mad at the university. They‚Äôre the reason the strike is happening. They‚Äôre the reason we won‚Äôt have TAs for who knows how long. The TAs want to strike just as much as we want them to (aka not at all) but it‚Äôs all they can do to make the university actually give a shit. So if you‚Äôre pissed off about the strike, good. Go tell Gene Block and the rest of the useless admin that. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.",

    "self_text": "Dear Fellow Workers,   The strike by 48,000 academic workers in  the University of California system is a historic struggle that requires  the support of all workers. Your fight for the doubling of starting  wages, cost-of-living protection and affordable housing, health care and  childcare resonates with millions of workers across the US and  throughout world.¬†  But a warning must be made: If your strike remains in the hands of  the UAW bureaucracy it will be isolated and betrayed like the 2020 COLA  strike and so many other struggles.   Strikers have already  informed me that the Student Researchers United has dropped the demands  for COLA and annual wage increases, defying the will of their own  members and breaking ranks with striking workers in other unions.   At  the same time, UAW bargainers have increasingly held secret talks with  management, ignoring demands by rank-and-file workers that every  bargaining session, in full, be live-streamed to the membership.¬†  This  has provoked a firestorm of opposition with strikers denouncing the  bargaining committee and insisting, ‚ÄúNo COLA, no contract!‚Äù Increasingly  there is a sense that rank-and-file workers must take control of the  situation or the strike will be betrayed.   The officers in the UAW  locals are currently under enormous pressure from the UAW ‚ÄúSolidarity  House‚Äù apparatus to drop everything and shut down the strike. The union  bureaucracy cannot tolerate academic workers winning major wages raises  and COLA because it will encourage autoworkers and other workers in the  UAW and beyond to demand the same. It would give an enormous impetus to  the rank-and-file rebellion that is already underway, and which is an  existential threat to the privileged positions of the pro-company police  force that runs the UAW.  But  this is precisely what is necessary. I urge striking UC academic  workers to follow the lead of autoworkers, railroad workers and  educators, who have formed rank-and-file committees as a new center of  democratic decision-making and workers‚Äô power.

    "title": "TA Strike Opinion - Let the Debate Ensue!",
    "self_text": "I am a fellow TA here (on a throwaway Reddit account) and I want everyone to hear me out about the reason why I will not be participating in the UAW Strike and why I do not encourage any of the undergraduate students to participate in the UAW strike.  I have been a TA for some time, but I want everyone to know that this issue is not just about the pay. It is about the lack of respect for educators like myself who devote hours on a weekly basis to provide educational support for students. Across the country, educators, namely teachers, are feeling discontented by the stark reality that they are not recognized for their work and commitment to learning and student success while higher level workers reap of the benefits (i.e., higher pay, stress-free work). It is the TAs, Professors, and Lecturers who nurture their students to success.  Consider the underlying issue that is occurring with public education in the U.S. in the articles below:  https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-teachers-in-america-are-leaving-the-profession-in-droves  https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/31/us/teachers-shortage-burnout-vacancies  Do we want a situation like a \"TA Shortage\" from occurring on our campus? Of course not! However, we must draw our battle lines carefully between self-fulfillment, well-being, and student commitment (consider the \"Virtue of Selfishness\" by Ayn Rand and \"Greatest Happiness Principle\" by John Stuart Mill).  Lately, I have been feeling that education and learning is becoming a dying field or will become a dying field as students are disinterested in learning. However, it is worth mentioning that some students of course work part-time jobs, have families, commute long hours (I, myself was commuting to and from school a couple of hours a day!), or other commitments that prevent them from having a burdenless education. I previously have worked with a student who was a single mother with two kids (one of them an infant), working a part-time job to provide financial support for her family, and was a full-time student. Many of you on this subreddit may think that \"it was her choice\" to be in her position or \"it was the TA's choice\" to be in this position, but so many TAs like myself chose this route because we wanted to contribute more to academia. Some of us pursued this path for higher academia because it was an ambition that we wanted to achieve, this is not a choice like pursuing a job that has a 100K annual salary versus become a TA and pursue higher education. For some, it is a dream and privilege to have been given this opportunity that is so difficult to pass. Some of you on this subreddit need to show the tiniest bit of empathy and compassion for these workers who devote numerous hours to watch you graduate and climb the ladder to a successful career. Others, like the TAs, need to show some remorse for the situation and the impact that it is having on your students. It is the TA's choice to attend the strike just as much as it is a student's choice to want to go to class. Remember that the situation goes both ways!  That being said, I chose to opt out of the UAW strike because I feel like it would be a disservice to my students. Despite the fact that less than half of my total class size joins my discussions that I put numerous hours of work into, I still have the urgency to support my students. Despite the fact that I upload my discussion notes and presentations on Canvas and notice that only a third of the total class actually views my notes (yes, the TAs and lecturers can track student activity on Canvas and see who has actually opened notes and watched videos), and yet I still want to support my students. Even though I took some time to record my discussion notes for students, I see the number of views for my discussion notes to be limited to a few students, and yet, I still feel obligated to support my students. I value your education more than anything because you are attending one of the most prestigious universities in the country and you deserve to have the quality of education that you rightfully earned. Even though I am facing hurdles being a TA (e.g., low salary, low student morale, low self-esteem and self-worth), I still have faith that the hard work that I do will pay off for the many students who I believe will grow to become successful workers in the job field.  I implore all of my TAs on this subreddit who are encouraging students to skip class in solidarity to stop. The whole purpose of being a TA is to support your students' education and we should not turn away our students who actually want to learn and become successful. The education of our students is not for us to deprive. This issue is our own and we must face it ourselves without dragging our students into this chaos. I have faith that a good outcome will come out of this mess, but I will never drag my students into this situation.  Everyone, please love each other and be kind to each other, and show some compassion and empathy for those in difficult situations.  Kind regards,  A TA",

    "self_text": "So I've been taking like three classes a quarter and I never really felt actual burnt out except maybe in my second year spring quarter where I was taking financial engineering and a math class, but other than that, I felt fine? I even switched my minor three times and I am still on track to graduate on time. I did take two summer classes which may have alleviated some of the workload, but my stress wasn't to the point of taking all nighters cause I had to (I did do some for fun cause I was enjoying the projects I was doing). I am not an engineering student, but seeing these engineering students taking 4-5 classes with all scary-sounding titles makes me respect them, but also makes me envy them in a way that I need to overload myself in order to make myself feel validated. I feel like my major is too easy or maybe I'm too lazy for not feeling burnt or constantly exhausted from studying. I know people who take 5 classes who work and do competitive club activities. I feel like this is all I can handle though and can't help but feel shame for not pushing myself over the edge or driving myself to exhaustion. Has anyone else feel this way? Am I an outlier at this school?",

My GE didn't have many spots so I figured I'd first pass that along with Physics. I got both classes but I seriously underestimated how much Math 32B would fill up. Now the only available Math 32B is an 8am, which conflicts with my Physics 1B class, the only one 1B left. This is a problem particularly because 32B is a co-req for 1B.  Is it advisable for me to try taking 1B without 32? And if it is, how would I go about doing that without getting removed from the class.  I'll try to see if I can just not take physics 1b but my second pass enrollment time is terrible so I might not have many options for classes by then.",

    "title": "Strike FAQ",
    "self_text": "Hi everyone! I've been seeing a lot of questions about the UAW strike and I wanted to provide some clear answers. I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student who has been working closely with UAW organizers to build undergraduate support for the strike, so feel free to DM me any other questions you might have as well.  &#x200B;    What does \"crossing the picket line\" mean? Should I go to class or not?    I want to make it very clear that UAW  has not called for a student boycott of classes.  If you would like to skip your class and join the picket line, I would personally certainly encourage that! But there has not been an official call to skip classes, and if you have a professor who is requiring attendance or something similar, that is their fault, not yours, and you shouldn't feel bad about going to class.  Picket lines are public demonstrations by striking workers to visibly show their power in numbers and let others know that there is a strike happening at the business they are picketing. 'Not crossing the picket line' varies from strike to strike, but typically means not supporting the business currently being picketed. At UCLA, this means not buying things from campus stores & restaurants, and not going to any discussion sections still being held during the strike.  &#x200B;    How long will the strike last for?    The strike will last until the UC administration agrees to bargain fairly with the striking workers. This entails the UC agreeing to stop their  illegal  interference in the bargaining process, and coming to the bargaining table with actual proposals that workers might be willing to accept. Every single striking TA I have talked to has told me they are very worried about their students and do not want a long strike, but that is not their decision at this point - it's the UC's. Whether the strike lasts for a week or a month will depend on when the UC agrees to bargain fairly. Basically, if you want a shorter strike, support our TAs and tell the UC to bargain fairly now!  &#x200B;    Isn't academia a cushy profession? Why are TA's striking?    This is a very common misconception. Some facts: the average yearly salary for a TA at the university of California is  below the poverty line for Los Angeles .  90%  of all UC TAs statewide are classified as Rent Burdened, meaning they pay >30% of their income in rent, and many pay up to  70%  of their income on rent. For those who live in university-owned housing such as Weyburn Terrace in Westwood, this is money going out of their paycheck right back to their employer. Academic workers also have terrible protections against workplace harassment, insufficient support for working parents, huge financial costs for international scholars, and a laundry list of other terrible conditions they are fighting against. A full look at the horrible treatment of academic workers by the UC can be found here. While academic work has never actually been a \"cushy ivory tower\" job, the historical collapse of state funding for the UC coupled with its increasing privatization has made workers' conditions worse and worse, resulting in the high exploitation we see today.  &#x200B;    Will higher pay for academic workers increase my tuition?    Our striking workers' current proposed wage increases would only constitute a 3% increase in the UC's entire $44 billion dollar budget. The work done by TAs, Student Researchers, and Post-Doctoral Students makes up the majority of teaching and research done at the UC, bringing in record-setting grant funding for our schools, and yet their pay is 22x less than average UC Chancellor salary and 58x less than the average UC hospital CEO salary. California is increasing the UC's funding by $602.3 million in 2022-2023, but currently that money is not being invested fairly: chancellors will receive a 9% wage  increase  while grad workers will receive a 5% wage  decrease  under the current proposal. While 90% of grad workers are rent burdened, the UC just bought President Drake a  $6.5 million dollar mansion . More examples of the horrific pay inequity at the UC (and sources for the above claims) can be found here.   TL;DR: No, the workers' current proposed wage increases would come from a fair reallocation of UC's vast resources, not an increase in our tuition.   &#x200B;    How can I support the strike?    The best way students can support the strike is by  joining our TAs on their picket lines!  There are 6 picket lines on campus that will be going from 8am-4pm every day of the strike. They are at the Broad Art Center, Bunche Hall, LuValle Commons, the Inverted Fountain, Engineering VI, and the Gonda Building. A map of all the pickets can be found here. Joining a picket line is super easy: just walk over to the picket, grab one of the many signs laying around (they're there for you to use!), and join the march!  Another critical way to support TAs is through donations. You can donate money to their strike fund here. Donations of food, water and coffee are also always needed on the picket lines! Simply show up to any of the picket lines with some food or drinks and the organizers there will be more than happy to accept them.  You can also sign this undergraduate petition to support our TAs that has nearly 1,500 signatures currently: tinyurl.com/SupportOurTAs. If you'd like to get plugged in to organizing information and bargaining updates, feel free to select the \"get involved\" option on the petition as well.  &#x200B;  Thank you so much r/UCLA! Solidarity!",

    "self_text": "I'm gonna rant here because I don't know where else to release this  So, I'm currently in a lab, and I have this one group member I will call Tina who makes everything in our lab group work so complicated when it is not.  During group work, Tina wants to explain the concepts already taught in class to us. Okay? what's the point of explaining this to me again? Why not just go straight to the point and concisely answer the exercise because we have limited time in the lab?  I noticed that they tend to do this when the TA is watching or around us. They try SOOOO hard to lose you in a conversation and make you feel dumb in some way. They also judge others and feel like they are so much better. One time, they said, \"psychobio is a stupid major who does not want to challenge themselves and only took it for an easy A\". I didn't know how to respond to that, so I just giggled awkwardly.  Yesterday, my other group member and I did the lab in an easy way by changing only one variable at a time to generate the plot because we wanted to finish it earlier since it's a holiday today.  BUT NO. Tina wants it the hard way. They went through their computer and tried their hardest to do the code that would generate everything all at once. This class is not about coding, but it will supplement our understanding of the concept taught in the lecture. Hence, our knowledge of coding and generating plots is limited.  When Tina was explaining things, I would agree to her point to shut her the fuck up. However,  she disagreed again and proposed another explanation for why her other point was invalid: \"My point is what if this is that and this is this?\" So, what did I do? I agreed with her second point again, but then she returned to her first point and argued.  Why Tina? Just why? Do you want me to praise you for being smart? Why make everything complicated when we can get an A on this lab without spending more than 6 hours? The other groups are finished and enjoying their Friday, and here I am emailing our TA to answer your question that is outside the scope. Also, why not email our TA yourself? Why make me do it? How much validation do you need?  do y'all work with this kind of people? How do you shut them down cause no amount of agreeing and disagreeing will satisfy them.",
