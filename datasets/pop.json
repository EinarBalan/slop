    "title": "[Spoilers Extended] Shireen \"Bright Reborn\"",
    "self_text": "Shireen's name may be a clue in favor of the theory that she will be sacrificed to R'llor. I think there is some wordplay going on here.  Separated into the two syllables \"Shir\" and \"Reen\" the name can be read as \"Bright-Reborn\" using Old English (which George very commonly uses) and French.  >Shere or Shire is derived from the Old English \"scir\", meaning  \"fair, bright, shining\" .  >Ren√© meaning  born again or reborn  in French is derived from the Latin name Renatus.  Why think French? Because the name Shireen or \"Shereen\" is also a French name from the word \"ch√©ri\"  (Listen to Google translate French to English say ch√©ri. The pronunciation is almost exactly the same) . Also George likes French and the history of France as he motioned when discussing the book  Les Rois Maudits  which was an inspiration for ASOIAF.  This reading of the name very closely matches the language used when a follower of R'llor discusses fire sacrifice or death.  >\"Let these girls be reborn in light. - Victarion  >Better that they be reborn into the light.\" - Selyse   The name \"Shireen\" is a play on words.  Within the \"darling\" Shireen or \"ch√©rie\"  hides a more sinister meaning related to R'llor worship.",

    "self_text": "I know the show is reality television and not everything is real, but the one thing that is real are the issues and feelings between the couples. And the issues in Zanab‚Äôs and Cole‚Äôs relationship is not only Zanab‚Äôs inability to release control once in a whole, but also, communication.  Cole is young and a male. Most men hav a harder time communicating and expressing their thoughts and emotions and I heard a whole lot of things from him, mainly between the lines, that Zanab either refused to hear or couldn‚Äôt hear. I think she has this image of herself that she is great at communicating and perfect and what‚Äôs to keep everything nice and clean that when that is disrupted she shuts down. Cole was trying to be nice and cook dinner for Zanab, and because it wasn‚Äôt being done the way she thought it should be done she took over. And I think Cole just let it happen, because he was trying to keep the peace.  So when they were sitting down and he kept saying ‚ÄúSomeone nice‚Äù and ‚ÄúI want my wife to like me‚Äù and ‚ÄúLook what happened in the kitchen‚Äù he was saying; ‚ÄúI tried to make dinner for you and you took over and made me feel stupid for trying.‚Äù Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the nerf ball in the kitchen was dangerous, but he was trying to have fun.  I think Zanab needs to; 1) be honest about her relationship with Cole and realize they are too opposite for it to work, 2) Work on living in the moment and not taking life so seriously, 3) Learn how to receive criticism from your SO without feeling attacked or getting defensive. And Cole needs to 1) Mature a little bit, 2) Stand up to his family more strongly and 3) Learn how to communicate without getting petty when he gets annoyed that his SO isn‚Äôt hearing what he is saying.  I honestly don‚Äôt think Cole and Zanab are bad people, they just aren‚Äôt good for each other and I think it has to do with their age gap and where they are in life.",

    "title": "(Spoilers Extended) Speculation on Bronn‚Äôs future role in the story",
    "self_text": "I think it‚Äôs pretty clear the Bronn still has more to do, and so far his character has been about him rising to ever more insane positions, despite starting out as interchangeable sellsword #2. Additionally he has also gotten tied up in themes relating to Cersei, specifically the tendency for her plans to backfire as well as her connection to self-fulfilling prophecies. We can see this with the whole Falyse Stokeworth incident, which so far just seems like a random plot point, but I think it might pay off in a big way.  I feel like the Golden Company is going to take Kings Landing, simply because I‚Äôm not sure what else would be the point of including Aegon VI. But this won‚Äôt be the end for Cersei, as she will flee to Casterly Rock. This is because it seems very likely that we will see CR in the series at some point, and this would be the quickest, and most logical way to get a POV there. Additionally Jaime seems set up to go there, and him going to deal with Cersei would be a easy way to do that. But this is not where Bronn comes in.  So the GC puts KL to siege, and somehow it falls. Probably some combination of the GC storming the walls as well as betrayal and infighting amongst the defenders. Cersei grabs Tommen and makes a break for it with like a twenty person escort or something (not sure what will happen with Myrcella). Robert Strong charges forward, and is able to cut a path right through the GC‚Äôs siege lines, allowing Cersei‚Äôs party to get away. But they still need to get out of the Crownlands. They ride until another party approaches them. It‚Äôs Bronn. The Stokeworth men attack Cersei‚Äôs party, and at first it seems folly, as Robert Strong cuts men down left and right, but they don‚Äôt need to fight Robert Strong. Instead one of them grabs Tommen right off his horse and Bronn‚Äôs men ride off. Sometime later JonCon gets a letter from Bronn saying he has the Boy King, and proceeds to make several demands for the ransom, including a small council seat. As Aegon VI can‚Äôt have his predecessor just running around, these terms are accepted. Tommen goes to KL where he ends up dying somehow, my guess is at Tyene‚Äôs hands.  Now I do have some other ideas for Bronn, but this is getting to far from published material. I think this would be a surprising event, that would still make sense, and bring Bronn back into the story. It fits with Cersei‚Äôs scheme constantly backfiring as Bronn wouldn‚Äôt have the Stokeworth men if it wasn‚Äôt for Cersei siccing Falyse and Balman on him, and the only reason she did that is because she was afraid that Bronn would be a threat to her children (or somewhat she does say in her internal monologue that she just wants him gone), meaning that this would be another instance of a self-fulfilling prophecy in Cersei‚Äôs story.

    "title": "[Spoilers Main] What happened to the Valyrian steel dagger?",
    "self_text": "How did the Valyrian steel dagger go from Aegon II to Petyr Baelish? After going on a deep dive through the asoiaf wiki, I believe the answer is through House Corbray.   First I checked Aegon II‚Äôs page and confirmed that all of his (legitimate) children died before they reached adulthood, meaning they had no descendants. I also confirmed that Alicent‚Äôs entire line ended shortly after the Dance, so there was no one else in that family line to inherit the dagger.  Next I went to Littlefinger‚Äôs page and tried to work backwards, but his family tree only goes back to his great-grandfather. I clicked on his link and saw this, ‚ÄúThe great-grandfather of Petyr Baelish was a Braavosi sellsword that came to the Vale of Arryn in the service of Lord Corbray.‚Äù  Since there wasn‚Äôt any further ancestor listed I clicked on the link for House Corbray. I figured if this was the connection between Aegon II and Littlefinger then the Corbray‚Äôs probably supported the Greens, but no, they fought for the Blacks. Specifically Lord Leowyn Corbray and his younger brother, Ser Corwyn Corbray, led an army of 10,000 Vale men to march on King‚Äôs Landing. Rhaenyra and Aegon were already dead before they arrived, but they took back King‚Äôs Landing and helped to install Rhaenyra‚Äôs son, Aegon III as the new king.  Since he was only 11 at the time and too young to rule, a council of regents ruled in his place. Lord Leowyn Corbray was named Protector of the Realm until he died of Winter Fever in the Red Keep two years later.  One year after the war Ser Corwyn Corbray married Rhaena Targaryen, daughter of Daemon Targaryen and Laena Velaryon, but they have no children together. Two years after that he was made one of the seven regents. He was killed at Runestone later that year while trying to capture one of the failed claimants for the succession of the Vale.   I believe it was one of these two brothers who came into possession of the dagger. Lord Leowyn would appear to be the more likely owner of the dagger. He was named Protector of the Realm while Aegon III was too young to hold the title. Perhaps the dagger was given to him as a gift when he took on the role. He lived the remainder of his life in the Red Keep and his son Quenton became Lord after Leowyn‚Äôs death, so him inheriting the dagger would ensure it stayed with their family until one of the Baelishes comes to possess it.   But there is still a case to be made for Ser Corwyn having the dagger. He married a Targaryen and he became one of the regents, so there are several ways he could have come into possession of the dagger. When he died he was wielding House Corbray‚Äôs Valyrian steel sword, Lady Forlorn. There‚Äôs nothing on his wiki page written about what happened to his body or the sword immediately after his death, but Lady Forlorn ended up being wielded by Ser Gwayne Corbray in the first Blackfyre Rebellion, and later by Ser Lyn Corbray in A Feast for Crows, so the sword was returned to House Corbray after Ser Corwyn‚Äôs death. It‚Äôs possible if he had also been in possession of the Valyrian steel dagger that it would have been presented to Lord Quenton alongside Lady Forlorn.   It should also be noted that in the same chapter of AFfC (chapter 23, Alayna I) where Ser Lyn Corbray draws Lady Forlorn, Littlefinger tells Sansa that Lyn works for him, so there‚Äôs still a close tie between their families. Perhaps it wasn‚Äôt his great-grandfather who got the dagger from a Corbray, or maybe Littlefinger got it from Lyn.   Of course another possibility is that the dagger ended up in the possession of House Tully or House Arryn and Lysa gave it to Petyr. But that‚Äôs pretty boring in my opinion, and I hope we see something in the show about either Leowyn or Corwyn receiving the dagger at the end of the Dance of the Dragons.",
