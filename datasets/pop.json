    "title": "[Spoilers Extended] Shireen \"Bright Reborn\"",
    "self_text": "Shireen's name may be a clue in favor of the theory that she will be sacrificed to R'llor. I think there is some wordplay going on here.  Separated into the two syllables \"Shir\" and \"Reen\" the name can be read as \"Bright-Reborn\" using Old English (which George very commonly uses) and French.  >Shere or Shire is derived from the Old English \"scir\", meaning  \"fair, bright, shining\" .  >Ren√© meaning  born again or reborn  in French is derived from the Latin name Renatus.  Why think French? Because the name Shireen or \"Shereen\" is also a French name from the word \"ch√©ri\"  (Listen to Google translate French to English say ch√©ri. The pronunciation is almost exactly the same) . Also George likes French and the history of France as he motioned when discussing the book  Les Rois Maudits  which was an inspiration for ASOIAF.  This reading of the name very closely matches the language used when a follower of R'llor discusses fire sacrifice or death.  >\"Let these girls be reborn in light. - Victarion  >Better that they be reborn into the light.\" - Selyse   The name \"Shireen\" is a play on words.  Within the \"darling\" Shireen or \"ch√©rie\"  hides a more sinister meaning related to R'llor worship.",

    "self_text": "I spent the past few months watching The OC, then Gilmore Girls. I felt a sense of deja vu watching Jess and Rory‚Äôs relationship in GG. It felt like they kept setting them up to be endgame but all the things that happened behind the scenes made it near impossible, just like Ryan and Marissa‚Äôs relationship on OC. It also felt like Logan and Taylor played the same type of characters, they tried really hard to make them ‚Äúthe one‚Äù since they couldn‚Äôt make Rory and Jess, and Ryan and Marissa endgame. I hope if there is another revival that we‚Äôll see Jess and Rory finally have good timing and be in a good place in their lives to be together after a lot of character growth. Especially since we‚Äôll never get the closure for Marissa and Ryan!",

The neighbor kid was obsessed with that movie and we'd often go to his house since he was the only one with a VCR and he'd force us to watch 3 NINJAS and them practice karate moves on us (which never hurt, mind you). Hate, hate this movie. Years later, I saw a sequel and it was even worse than the original.   MY GIRL 2. I actually liked the first movie so I was excited to watch the sequel. It turned out to be a boring ass movie about Vada looking for her dead mother's backstory and then getting her first kiss with the LAST ACTION STAR kid. Jesus, Gross!   HOME ALONE 3. Pretty pointless to do a HOME ALONE movie without Macaulay Culkin and Alex D. Linz was no Culkin. Pity Kieran Culkin was already in HOME ALONE, he would have been a decent replacement.",

Mind you, they‚Äôre pairing them with women in their 30s, who all expressed they wanted kids. It‚Äôs just weird, and set them up for failure I think. Alexa wants a house, Raven‚Äôs ready for rent divided by 2, Nancy got houses to buy‚Ä¶like realistically women still desiring children past 30 need real providers.",

    "self_text": "I know the show is reality television and not everything is real, but the one thing that is real are the issues and feelings between the couples. And the issues in Zanab‚Äôs and Cole‚Äôs relationship is not only Zanab‚Äôs inability to release control once in a whole, but also, communication.  Cole is young and a male. Most men hav a harder time communicating and expressing their thoughts and emotions and I heard a whole lot of things from him, mainly between the lines, that Zanab either refused to hear or couldn‚Äôt hear. I think she has this image of herself that she is great at communicating and perfect and what‚Äôs to keep everything nice and clean that when that is disrupted she shuts down. Cole was trying to be nice and cook dinner for Zanab, and because it wasn‚Äôt being done the way she thought it should be done she took over. And I think Cole just let it happen, because he was trying to keep the peace.  So when they were sitting down and he kept saying ‚ÄúSomeone nice‚Äù and ‚ÄúI want my wife to like me‚Äù and ‚ÄúLook what happened in the kitchen‚Äù he was saying; ‚ÄúI tried to make dinner for you and you took over and made me feel stupid for trying.‚Äù Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the nerf ball in the kitchen was dangerous, but he was trying to have fun.  I think Zanab needs to; 1) be honest about her relationship with Cole and realize they are too opposite for it to work, 2) Work on living in the moment and not taking life so seriously, 3) Learn how to receive criticism from your SO without feeling attacked or getting defensive. And Cole needs to 1) Mature a little bit, 2) Stand up to his family more strongly and 3) Learn how to communicate without getting petty when he gets annoyed that his SO isn‚Äôt hearing what he is saying.  I honestly don‚Äôt think Cole and Zanab are bad people, they just aren‚Äôt good for each other and I think it has to do with their age gap and where they are in life.",
