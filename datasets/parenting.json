    "self_text": "Hey everyone. I’m currently the step-father of a 7 year old, and my wife and I are having tremendous issues with her behavior. She does whatever she wants, refuses to listen to us and tries to boss everyone around constantly, including us. We don’t obey her, call her out on her behavior and try to teach her correct behavior. We don’t believe in corporal punishment, so we’ve used nearly every tool we have and nothing seems to work. We took her Alexa device, all of her books and some of her most cherished stuffed animals. When that didn’t work, we cut off all screen time. Each time we escalate the punishment, we do our best to remain unemotional when putting it in place and continue to let her know that we still love her, and that it was her decisions caused these consequences. It all seems to bounce off of her. Based upon that scenario, I have two questions:    Is there anything else we can/should be doing to continue escalating the punishments, or are we overlooking another potential method of correction?    I, as a step-parent with no previous exposure to children, have no idea what’s normal behavior for each age bracket. Is there some sort of widely accepted resource out there that addresses that topic. I’d like to get ahead of the expected behaviors moving forward.",

After talking about it, I was in board to let her, but she had to pay and go somewhere, and wait til closer to her bday. We were in agreement.  Now about 5 months later she has pierced both her nostrils and an eyebrow herself. Out of spite because she had the deep clean chores this week and I made her redo them because she half assed it. So while she was supposed to be cleaning she was piercing herself. They look terrible. The rings and the piercings, red and crooked. She is an oily kid so I was trying to make her wait for her benefit, but she will never get that. Idk what to do. I really need to put my foot down with her. Do I take things away until she removes them? Talking it out isn't going to work.",

    "self_text": "My 2 year old has been in the process of potty training for a few months now. She seemed ready, but she has a lot of issues with poop that have complicated things. She goes pee no issue. Occasional if she is playing and doesn't want to miss out she might leak a little, but it isn't often. Poop is a whole nother ball game. For a while she was scared of her poop. Totally normal and I expect it. We worked through it and were doing a lot better. Then she fell in the toilet while trying to go at the sitter's house and we had to start over. Got better for a while then baby sister was born. Got better and went two weeks without an accident of any sort, the longest ever. Then randomly last week and she is back to pooping herself. I'll put her on the potty, she'll pee, say she's all done, then poop herself a few minutes later. Or any time I leave her she'll poop herself even if she went right before I left. I was gone maybe an hour and a half the other day and, despite going before, she pooped herself twice in that time.   I can't help but feel like she is doing it on purpose to get attention. She is very attached to me and gets flustered if I can't give her attention all the time. Even with the new baby I make sure I'm giving her quality 1 on 1 time for at least an hour every day while baby sleeps. Outside that time we still are together and playing I just can't always do what she wants because I have to nurse. But if she poops herself I have to stop and tend to her. What can I do to help get over this?",

    "title": "Advice on Nap Time",
    "self_text": "Asking for advice from all the experienced parents here. Our two little (foster) kids do quiet time every day, because we found without it, they become completely unable to regulate in the evenings. We told them they don't have to nap, they just have to play quietly in their rooms, but most of the time they nap.  Recently, our 6 year old has quit napping. We have noticed a dramatic uptick in behavior issues in the evening/bedtime when he doesn't nap. Yelling, screaming, crying, and becoming violent (throwing things, hitting, last week he put his hands around my husband's neck). We told him he has to start napping again for quiet time to be over.  He is fighting the nap. I can tell he's tired, but he doesn't want to nap. He has had a cough since we got them in March, and was recently given an inhaler. I am waiting for the pulmonology appointment. I would say 80% of the time the cough is natural, but the other 20% he is either forcing himself to cough, or forcing himself to cough harder than he needs to. Today, he forced himself to cough so much, he threw up. Two questions:    I know if they throw up, they're not supposed to go to school the next day. But he did not deny when I told him he made himself cough so hard, and is not saying he does not feel well. Is it wrong of me to send him to school (assuming he has no fever)?    Any tips on the nap time power struggle?",

    "self_text": "I don’t even know how to start and I don’t really know what I’m looking for here. I guess just some thoughts.   My 2 year old was injured by an NP at his doctor’s office last night.   The office offers an after hours sick clinic and after watching his fever hang out and rise and him getting more and more sick we decided to take him in. He has never loved getting exams but will usually tolerate it. A nurse came in an gave him a flu test, obviously he hated it. 20 minutes later an NP comes in, let’s us know it was negative but says she thinks he has the flu and he was just tested too early. She then starts to llisten to his lungs & heart. She moves on to check his ears, I was holding him but he was resisting her. She keeps trying and at some point another person came in to help out. We were all visibly upset about my sons reaction when I look at him and see blood dripping from his ear. The other person who came into the room immediately left, the NP tried to look again to see what happened with no luck. A few minutes later the doctor in charge came in. She was definitely in damage control mode. She said she thinks the NP might have tapped his ear drum while trying to remove wax. I don’t know why a plastic tool would be used ti remove wax from an obviously upset & sick 2 year old but let’s see what going on.  My husband and I hold him down so she can she what’s going on, she pierced his ear drum. She went over what to expect as far as healing and sent in a prescription for some ear drops, that I had to pay for. She apologizes and says she hopes my sons “cold” gets better soon.   I am having the hardest time finding my thoughts & feelings with all of this. I keep seeing his tiny bloody ear and bawling. He won’t let us near his ear to clean it or out the drops in. I’ve tried while he sleeps and it just seems so sentive.   We have loved the office and his pediatrician which kind of makes this harder to me somehow.  EDIT: Thank you all so much. I wanted to clarify that this happened during an after hours sick clinic & his normal doctor wasn’t involved. I’m still working through if we will stay at the office, we have a great relationship with the doctor. I went into the office and waited until I could speak with his doctor in private.   I feel very heard by him, he took a long time listening to me. He cleared both the doctor and the NP’s schedules so he can meet with them and find out why it was documented. The proper documentation will be added and he said he would send us anything we wanted. He scheduled us for an appt with him and called an ENT friend. We were reimbursed for last nights appt & the ear drops. There won’t be a fee for anything pertaining to his ear. I am feeling decently satisfied with how the conversation went",

    "self_text": "I have been a bookworm basically my whole life, so I’ve been very pleased that my kids are all fairly avid readers as well.   One book in particular has held a special place in my heart for a long time. It’s the first one for a series that I read over and over when I was about 11 - 16 or so. This series was my happy place and I have such fond memories of falling in love with it for the first time.  I still have the book, and decided randomly to offer it to my son (12). He seemed enthusiastic and I wasn’t worried.  Well…3 weeks later, I just found it in his room almost destroyed. It was literally jammed up under his bed with a bunch of junk. Like it had been kicked under there like nothing. The cover is torn. Pages are falling out. The back looks like it’s been wet.  I am just gutted. I didn’t even think twice about loaning it to him, never imagined this would happen. He’s a fairly responsible kid, not the type to destroy things. I simply said “that book is important to me so take good care of it, alright?” And he said he would.  My husband says I am “making something out of nothing” but he is 12, almost 13. In my opinion that is more than old enough to know better. I read it repeatedly at the same age and managed to take care of it. He’s never damaged a book from school or the library like this. There’s no excuse, frankly.  I really don’t know what to do about this or what to make of it. I normally am a pretty firm parent who believes in reasonable consequences, and if it was anything else, I would’ve told him he needs to pay to replace it. But this isn’t just any book. I don’t care about the damn $10 or whatever a new copy would cost. The sentimental value, which I can’t get back, is priceless and irreplaceable.   I’m just extremely disappointed and I don’t even know what to do. I know I should say something, but what? Is this even a punishable offense? I’m so upset I have just tabled the issue right now, he has no idea I’ve taken the book back and now I’m just trying to figure out how to handle it.",

    "self_text": "So I've started some new attempts at rules consequences and time outs so maybe I need to get through this stage but this general behavior has been going on awhile. We are attempting to stay on a gentle parenting path.  He is 6 and mostly non verbal, no obvious signs of being on the spectrum but being ADHD/asd myself I'm not discounting it, and some of what he does ticks a lot of adhd boxes.  He is an absolute angel for every single person who isn't me. But he's been getting worse and worse with being defiant and not following rules. I know I'm largely responsible because I've been in a massive burnout and struggling to even exist properly myself, making following through with consequences even harder and I'm trying to overcome.it because this behavior is what's going to drown me  He says no to everything. Fights and resists every attempt to clean his room or get time outs for throwing stuff. puts the TV all the way and screams no when I ask him to put it down, sneaks to find remotes when I turn it down, etc etc I had been physically carrying him to time out and then sitting behind him to prevent running away, restarting the timer when he acted too too bad. We are trying to change to a new method, where I lead him to the couch and he sits for 5ish minutes until calm. He did finally go after I physically took the TV and put it on a shelf. But there was much screaming and fighting. When I try to do the holding out my hand to calmly lead him He will just run to a new place. I ended up locking my room after he kept going in there and broke my closet door slamming it around making a big deal of hiding from me. I try to just go calmly walk up and ask him to take.my hand, to lead him to the couch..that never happened. I did walk away and have a scream after the door. This is one of the struggles I have I am always already out of spoons by the time we get to these power struggles.  So I got him out of my room and locked the door. Right in front of me while I say no and try to remove him from the door he works on opening the door. (My doors have locks that open from the hallway side by inserting anything flat to unlock instead of a key) it's just so much and I am not really capable of handling this no matter how I try to stay level and model calm behavior, I try to get away from him when I know I'm about to blow my top but he FOLLOWS me.  This is a bit all over because I really am just completely overwhelmed. There are no other parents or family near by to try to seek help to at least get breaks so we can try to start over fresh and calm. Right now I've taken the TV and set a 24 hour timer. I know I shouldn't have let him have a tablet but I needed him to let me alone for a bit while I recover from what was basically 2 hour power struggle so he's got that right now. This was all mostly over him helping me clean his room which he did finally \"agree\" to do but didnt actually help at all. I intend to thin it out a bit tomorrow while he's at school, not in a punishment way but I'm going to try to remove any toys I have not seen him play with for awhile and just get rid of them so it's less overwhelming for us both.   I'm really just hoping for any tips or tricks on getting us through this, and if it sounds like I'm on the right track, and if it's likely after a couple consequences he might start fighting me less. It's just non stop power struggles from him getting home from school to going to bed. Advice on getting him to respect my room as my space too please. I don't even know I might just needed to vent.   When he's not being like this he's the sweetest little smoosh, a living cuddle monster. So it's not like, he's just some bad kid. He's a momma's boy when the defiant switch isn't flipped.",

Long story short, my (39M) girls (8 and 5) are living half way across the country and outside of holidays, my only contact with them are video chats. Which usually consist of them saying \"Hi, love you, miss you.\", and then they hang up. I understand that keeping kids on the video chat, especially the 5 year old, is challenging. I'm not looking to get them to sit down for an hour every day, but I would like more interaction with them. I was wondering if anyone here has any experience with this and can offer some advice. They both have brand new tablets and we typically use Google Meet. Are there any other age appropriate game apps, is it possible to play anything through a video chat together?

    "self_text": "Over the last few weeks our 7 year old daughter has been almost unbearable to live with. She’s always been a little temperamental but recently she’s flying off the handle over even the slightest inconvenience. Just genuinely raging and  nothing will calm her down. She gets quite nasty telling us she hates us etc. it’s really quite upsetting and it’s hard to stay calm with her when she’s screaming and growling and just generally being horrible.  Eventually she calms down and is completely normal again almost as if nothing happened. I really don’t know what’s going on, she’s gone from a normal girl to, for want of better words, emotional unstable. Everything appears fine at school and we’ve had no issues anytime before. We will ofc be going to the drs but in the meantime I’ve been Googling and read about something called Adrenarche which appears to be a precursor to puberty and wondering if that’s what it could be. Not really sure why I’ve wrote so much or if it’s of any use but was just wondering if anyone else had been through a similar situation and had any words of wisdom?  Thanks",

    "self_text": "So I split from my LOs father a few years ago but we continued to live together up until this summer.   I suffered from really bad postpartum depression, my relationship with LOs father was also really bad, I was constantly belittled and controlled. I was suicidal, depressed and couldn’t get out of bed. Because of this there was about a year where my ex was the primary caregiver, I was physically there but mentally not.   It took time but I managed to get my mental health back in order through medication, talk therapy and CBT. I’m in a much better place now and things really got better once me and my ex finally started to live separately.   Obviously this was hard on our 3 year old. But it helped me get to a better place and become more engaged as a parent. But I’m so scared that the damage has already been done.   I work construction, it’s hard work, tough hours but it provides me with a good income and great benefits. Because of my work schedule I have custody on the weekends plus picking LO up from school one day midweek.  Every time I pick LO up from daycare the first words he says when he sees me is “I want daddy”. Walking to it car it's always “are you bringing me to daddy's? When is daddy picking me up?”   Last night he asked over and over again “ when is daddy coming to pick me up?” bedtime comes around and LO starts packing up his stuffed animals and says “I want to go to daddy's house”.   I try to gently validate his love for his dad but tell him he had two houses and that we will have fun over the weekend- this doesn’t seem to help.   I’m exhausted by the time the weekend comes around so I do my best to play with LO, take him on fun outings, get to the playground etc. I don’t have any time to myself- I work hard all week then weekends are 100% about my son. I wouldn’t change this for the world. But I’m just so tired and it really hurts that despite my best efforts LO seems to want nothing to do with me.   It hurts a lot and I feel like a failure. The first year of LOs life I was very engaged, stayed at home and was the primary care giver. I feel like that bond got destroyed after my PPD really kicked in.   It just hurts so much and I don’t know how to make LO feel better about spending the weekends with me.",

I don’t have children of my own, so this is new territory for me. He has been diagnosed with ODD, so issues with not listening to his mother and teachers at school and excessive swearing and making threats, as well as occasionally getting physically aggressive.  Anyway, his mother has gotten to a point of having a very short fuse with him, having a very unsettling tone whenever he’s acting out. For the most part, he’ll do things when I ask and even apologize for acting out because I address him with a friendly tone. She’s working on addressing that, but I’m unsure if this one change will solve the issues entirely.   I guess I’m just hoping maybe someone here can direct me to some resources for dealing with ODD. The biggest thing right now is trying to keep him focused in school because more days than not, he’ll scream at his teachers and flat out refuse to do schoolwork.   Also maybe some resources that can give me guidance on what I can do to help him adjust to having a sudden father figure in his life. We know that’s something he desperately needs. He’s always talking about how he misses his dad. Just last night we had this conversation:  “Are you really my step dad?”  Not exactly, your mother and I would have to get married for it to be official. Do you want me to be your step dad?  “Okay well you can just be my dad, shut up and stop talking about it.”  🥹  On his bad days though, he’ll always say something like “Shut up, you’re not my dad.”  So, I dunno. I’m just trying to be responsible and take this seriously and try to be there whenever I can.   Thank you!",

Granted we are just getting up to speed on birthdays, but I had to bring this to a larger audience to get some outside opinions.  We were attending a party of twin boys turning 5. My son was classmates with them but not particularly close. I would not be out on a limb to say they are of a lower socioeconomic class. The party was located at a church. All of that is just background...  We arrive and there are a few toys out and some pictures of trucks. It is boring for my taste but my jaw hits the floor when it comes to the cake.  Since they are twins they each get their own cake. Things go south when they cut the cake... Some of the kids bring their plate to get a slice when the Mom says \"No\".  The explanation is that the cakes are just for the birthday boys. The guests can have cupcakes. So the kids comply but you have this weird juxtaposition of two kids stuffing themselves with cake and the rest with these rather lame cupcakes.   I have never seen anything like this. My wife thinks this may be cultural but I think it is just low class. I felt bad for the children there. They rolled with it, I could imagine ina few years kids being like wtf.  Anyone else experience this? Is this a real practice?  Edit  They did not have allergies  The cakes were larger full size cakes and decorated ornately",

    "self_text": "When my husband (26M) and I (26F) had our son it was decided that my father in law would watch him. He had watched my husbands niece and nephew when they were babies. And we were okay with that. Well, after about 2 or 3 months he told us that he couldn’t do it anymore. He has suffered from mental illness since my husband was a kid and he just didn’t feel that he could do it. We weren’t mad, we were actually happier that he told us. But that meant that my now 7 month old would be home with me everyday, while I worked.  So for the next 9 months my son was home with me 100% of the time and my husband about 70% (he had to go into work a couple times a week but would come home midday) but we still worked 100% of the time. And couldn’t afford to not work but also couldn’t afford daycare. So my son watched/watches a lot of TV, independently played, and just existed around us. We always had eyes on him, but he did like to walk around and play in the (safe) kitchen cabinets and pull out my mixing bowls, etc. We always took time to give him his bottles, feed him, take him for walks everyday, and my mom would take him some days. But after work we would do the normal: dinner, bath, chill (read or watch TV) and bottle. So all that to be said, we don’t really play with him a lot. We do a lot with him, but not really playing.  When my son turned 15 months (last month) my husband got a different job that paid way more, but would make him very busy. So we put my son in daycare. And I love his daycare so far.   I’m concerned because he doesn’t say words. He says “Dah” for everything. And he babbles/talks to himself/makes loud noises. But, he won’t say words. When we try (which is all the time) he makes this face like he’s trying so hard but then all that comes out is “dah”??? Or he gets frustrated and whines.   To give all the facts: he does have a significant tongue tie to the point he can’t lift his tongue. I already have an appointment scheduled to get it snipped because his pediatrician said that could lead to him not knowing how to use his tongue properly. So I know he really wouldn’t be able to do certain sounds. I will also be doing a hearing test because when he was little I was worried about his hearing and he failed his hearing test in the hospital 2 out of the 3 times they had to give it to him.   But I’m worried. Did keeping him home, watching TV, and not really playing with him cause a speech delay?   I have been mom spiraling about this for 6 or 7 months.",

It was okay for us when he was younger and smaller, now my wife can't hold him for this long due to his weight (12kg / 26lbs). We sought help with a sleeping centre attached to a local hospital to us, and they gave some really helpful advice over the few days we stayed there. The change was to relax him enough through quiet time and soft reading that he would lay still, we could pat his back, make \"shhh\" sounds and off he would go. When we first started this it worked for a few weeks, then he realised he can just stand up and move as he pleases. If we try and lay him back down, he will fight and cry to the point I'd have to over power him to keep him laying down, which even the thought of doing feels so mean and tormenting. And so it went back to the original tactic of him being held and walked around until he is asleep as this back and forth of him fighting and crying can last hours of his tears and misery, versus me giving in and holding him.   I've spoken with friends, family, doctors, sleep doctors, iridologists and I'm just all out of strategies..

The first thing she does when waking up is running to us to make sure we tie a ponytail (she isn't yet capable of doing it on her own), and she will wear it until she goes to bed at night.  During the day, 2 or 3 times she would panic that her ponytail isn't tight enough, and she would ask us to re-do it.  If, for some reason, the ponytail breaks, she would cry and stress about it.  She is kind of a tom boy (likes wearing \"boy\" clothes, will not come near a dress), and we think that's related somehow (walking around with long hair not tied up is more \"girly-looking\" in her opinion).  The problem we have with this is that it's causing her a lot of misery (if the ponytail breaks or isn't tight enough, she would cry and stress out until it's sorted). We are wondering how we might help her be more chill about it.  Would love to hear your thoughts (especially if you experienced something similar).  Thanks!",

    "self_text": "Not waste what’s going on, thinking it’s due to some mental health issues but not really sure.   So first off one of the big problems is that he is constantly sighing at everything. I mean everything. We ask him to the simplest of things and he lets out an overly dramatic sigh of discontent. It happens dozens of time every day. If something doesn’t work the way he wants it to he sighs. It’s really hard to listen to all the time.   He’s a good kid but has a poor attitude sometimes and it can really wear on you. Some days he comes home from school and the entire mood/vibe of the house shifts from happy and chill to just negative and unhappy. Then everyone else’s mood seems to go downhill and we are all under one another’s skin and irritable.   I try to remember it’s a difficult time and teens are often moody and like this but can’t help but wonder if it’s here is something deeper going on.. Like - depression?   The reason I say this is because he seems to have almost no interests at all. Outside of gaming and watching tic toc which if it were up to me - I wouldn’t allow at all. ( it the gaming but the tic toc) he doesn’t go too hard on the gaming most of the time. But he seems to not enjoy anything else unless his hand is being held doing it. What I mean is he won’t draw or colour unless we do it with him. He won’t go outside and play unless we go with him.   We have tried to get him interested in extracurricular activities such as sports or music but he won’t bite. He says he would (hypothetically) but when asked it’s always a no and a long drawn out whining and almost crying at times if we really try to push him to do it.   He rarely if ever does stuff with friends or kids his age outside of school. He had no interest in forming friendships with other kids outside of school. I try not to compare his experience to my own but can’t help myself feeling it’s abnormal and that when I was that age I was always wanting to connect with and hang out with other kids my age.   He has a lot of energy, he’s diagnosed adhd and untreated. I think it needs to be treated because it’s gotten to the point where he’s literally pinging off the walls, jumping up and down the punching the ceiling constantly. It’s hard to have a conversation with him because he will stray to jump to touch the ceiling over and over. Or he will fidget with things. He doesn’t pay attention easily, his attention span is not the greatest. He interrupts so much. And his memory is not the best… we are getting his adhd dealt with because we think it will help a lot but he doesn’t want to be on the meds because it “makes him feel weird” which I can understand but things have gotten worse over the years and we worry it’s affecting his high school experience. And from my understanding untreated adhd can cause anxiety and depression.   Am I reading too much into this? Is this normal behaviour? Is there anything else I could or should be doing to help him have a better experience in life?    one stressed out mama",

My husband found out he had a child from a previous relationship, a child, hubby knew nothing abot until a couple of months ago (11 I think) I met my stepson (9m) a couple of months after we found out and after my husband and kids got to meet him, he acted so distant towards me and always ignored me which was a bit frustrating because I wanted to make him feel welcome but he just didn't let me, I even posted here to get some advice and see what were those things I could do to earn his trust.   My husband shares custody now and we have him on weekends, we started having him over like three months ago and at the beginning he was just as distant and ignored me as he did the first time we met and this went on for weeks but everything changed (for good) in the last two weeks.   I was working on a project at a little space (I call office) at my house, my stepson was staying with us, he came to my \"office\" and saw some of my work, he didn't know I was an architect and asked me: \"Are you an architect?\" (Keep in mind that these were the first words that came out of his mouth to me) \"Yes\" I said so he asked me to show him some of my work and I did and as I was doing it he started asking so many questions and that became our very first conversation and for my surprise the next day he was very talkitive, and that was so rewarding.   He kept asking to do things together like going to get grocery (Something he never asked me before, lol) and I really enjoy it, he shows me some of drawings (of buildings) so I \"rate them\", he even got to point to ask me to take him to my office (my and my colleague's studio) and I took him, he is a well-behaved child, he kept asking the people working there a lot of questions (hahaha) but they enjoyed answering, he was stuned by a building model we exhibit at the reception.   Since that day he doesn't ignore me any more and asks me to do things together as a family (He was happy to exclude me before) maybe this is just because of my job but I'm happy we could find something we both like to bond, he says he wants to become an architect too, he'll probably change his mind, probably not (I mean I knew I wanted to be an architect since I was like 7) but this is a good start for our relationship that will last (at least) nine more years.   I'm happy, I just wanted to share this.",

Our daughter was allowed to rule the house and we both did whatever she wanted to keep the peace. N’s meltdowns and screaming tantrums are epic and it was just easier to do what she wanted and keep her calm than doing the right thing by setting boundaries and not giving in.   Shortly after getting divorced I met my now fiancé. She has two daughters of her own and currently lives in a different state. All 3 girls get along great but my fiancé (correctly so) can’t handle N’s outbursts and disrespect. I have had almost two years to fix these known issues and I have failed.   N is ruining my relationship with my fiancé and it’s all my fault.   I have told my fiancé all the right things…all the things I KNOW I need to do but I haven’t done them consistently.   This past weekend all 5 of us were together and it seemed to be the last straw when I let my daughter get away with something AFTER I asked my fiancé to what I should do. She told me what I needed to do (she was right) and I did the opposite to try and keep the peace. Well, a meltdown happened anyway and the entire thing blew up in my face.   Does anyone have any advice on: A) What I can do to follow through on my words and turn them into action and  B) how I can convince my fiancé that I really am trying to do the right thing but I keep failing.   Thank you all!  Edit: My ex wife and I split custody 1 week/1 week and my fiancé has full custody of her daughters and is in the process of trying to move to my location.",

    "self_text": "Is it possible to get a three year old to respect their parents? My three year old is at the age where she is testing boundaries which is to be expected. Where it makes sense we use gentle parenting and talk things out. My daughter is especially sensitive so this works often. We use rewards when we are trying to motivate her. What I'm at a loss for is when she won't listen.  We use time outs when we've asked her to do something multiple times and she doesn't listen or is acting out like hitting, kicking or spitting. I don't want to use violence or harsh punishment to make my kids fear me but I do want them to respect and trust me. Often times when I am most assertive with her it's a safety issue which is where trust comes in. For example \"don't run into the street\". In general we are pretty laid back so if I'm telling my kids something in an assertive tone I'd like them to know this is serious business and I'm not messing around.   I know a lot of this is age appropriate but is there a better way to get her to listen when we ask her to or not to do something? Is it possible to get her to respect us and listen the first time without using fear? Or is that expecting too much for her age?  What are your techniques for getting a toddler to be respectful at home and in public?",

Everything and I mean everything is a tug-of-war with her. Getting in the shower is a battle, brushing her teeth is a battle, eating is a battle and on top that, the daily tantrums are getting worse. It's putting a massive strain on my marriage and I'm fed up with her.  Pardon my language but sometimes I just feel like telling her to shut the f*ck up and do as she is told. We work hard and try to give her attention, affection and spend as much time with her as possible. We take her to the park, beach, outdoor games and activities, play dates and read to her at night but the tantrums will not stop. She has got all the gadgets she needs too (2 ipads, toddler puzzle games etc). We got her a new bike, scooter and the Rigo Kids Range Rover for her bday but nothing seems to work.  Are there any experienced parents out there that have experienced similar challenges? How did you deal with it? Any advice or material I should read on how to handle toddlers?   Side note : I wanted to have more kids but after this experience, I don't think I want to go through this again. I'm ashamed to say that I think I'm beginning to resent her.

I got to a point where she started trying to kick on top of the furniture while I was trying to put her back in bed after the tenth time she crawled out screaming. I felt an anger I haven't felt in a long time about to explode.  I don't believe in spanking or any sort of physical discipline  when it comes to raising kids but this anger was past that.

Most recently, last night the oldest was on this balancing toy for a few minutes and the youngest wanted her turn. Instead of nicely asking for her turn and patiently waiting for the oldest to do the thing she wanted to before finishing, the youngest just pushed her off after yelling \"you always take forever and never stop when it's my turn!\" However, it's pot calling kettle black cause the youngest just did this with the hoola hoop.  Both are fighting and we need to intervene. No punishments discussed, just is asking why they're each upset and how could we have avoided this conflict already. Oldest understands how both are guilty of not patiently waiting for their turns AND not finishing their turns in a more selfless way.  Oldest one quiet the entire time, despite us going back in time to the same day where she needed to be better about the reverse during hoola hoop time, let alone using their cousin's bike, and playing other games. Each girl was clearly shown how they had their moments of impatience and selfishness with each other.   Little one is not only angry at the incident, she's now angry she had to be talked to. No punishments were given, but this anger has been a problem for literally years. Asking what's wrong, and what are so furious about, she just mumbles and starts doing the \"I already know! You don't have to tell me!\"   Not once was there any yelling or scolding. Us listening to their grievances and trying to calm them down and see the big picture.  I get both girls in front and give them options.   If we stay calm and be nice, we can go back to playing with everyone downstairs before everyone leaves.   Or   If we are angry and not calm, we lose out on the rest of play because it's now 10pm.   Options were given. Punishment only if they decide to lash out, essentially. Oldest one realizes this is her get out of jail free card and says I understand. On her way she goes. Youngest starts moaning, whining, saying that her oldest \"ALWAYS DOES THIS AND NEVER GETS IN TROUBLE,\" when we all know it's not true. So, how do we get this girl to not get so angry despite our best efforts to teach them appropriate behavior and manage her anger?  She goes from being angry at her sister for not immediately sharing, to getting angry for being gently told how things could've played out better, to getting angry for the possibility of punishment when it's clear as day she had options to make things right with her sister? Being compassionate doesn't calm her down. Being stern doesn't calm her down. Literally the only thing that will calm her down is to give her whatever she's demanding at that moment, which unfortunately isn't healthy.  We're at a loss for how to handle her tantrums.",

Of course when he was a newborn there wasn't much choice, but even as he grew and became more aware of things he still loved the pictures and the way we interact with the story. But now he's a little over 1, and all he'll do is try to close the book or chew on it lol. I've tried everything I can think of, but he always just tries to move away. Some people are saying it's just a phase but I was wondering if anyone has any tips??",

    "self_text": "Last night, out of nowhere, my 4 year old son asked if I’m going to die soon. I said no, definitely not. Then he asked if I am going to die when I get very very old, and he asked if everyone dies. Then he asked me if he is going to die.   I don’t know where he is getting this from and I have no idea how to answer. But I had and still have a crippling fear of death and I do not want to impart this on him. I generally don’t mention it though, because I don’t want him to think about it.   We did have one dog in our life that passed away when he was 2, and he just says she’s in heaven now. (I think his grandparents told him that because we are not very religious)  When he was asking me these things last night, I just mumbled no and I don’t know and nobody knows and I started asking him about Halloween candy and school instead. What am I supposed to do here?  Edit: I have to make this clear- I would love to answer his questions but I am aware that I have no ability to explain death without experiencing fear and panic. I came here to ask HOW I can answer his questions. I really don’t understand why I get downvoted for asking for advice. Isn’t that what this sub is here for? Please refrain from berating me and offer advice if you have it. I would like to hear from parents who have had similar experiences and potentially have an answer that might not scare the crap out of my son. Thank you in advance.",

He spent about 4 full days in the hospital and we have been with him at home since then (me taking time away from work and my wife working from home to be nearby).  My wife and I disagree on whether he should return to daycare when he recovers. She thinks he gets TOO sick but I figure that’s normal (to a degree).   She is considering getting a full-time caregiver (sitter/nanny) for him to stay home and not be around so many others’ germs. I think he should return to daycare and continue building immunity, but my wife says I’m “not prioritizing his health”.  Daycare had a lot of pros:    It’s nearby/close to home  it’s relatively affordable for us  the hours are long/flexible to fit our irregular work schedule  the class size is small (only 6 kids in his group) -and most importantly: our son LOVES it there   The one major con:   he keeps getting sick   We’ve discussed this with our pediatrician and doctors during our sons hospital stay, but we keep being told that it’s “our decision to make as a family” ..but we’re split.

Thanks in advance!  Edit:. I don't plan on reading every message. She got herself in a crappy situation lately. She overheard kids on the bus saying some horrible things and told the school principal about it which got them in trouble and parents informed. Somewhere in her 12 year old mind she thought it was a good idea to tell them she was the one who told. Both boys live in our neighborhood and are a bit rough. One of the dads actually reached out and said she did the right thing and he was proud of her, unfortunately that is how we found out about everything. I'm worried about bullying as a result of it. Some other stuff lately has me concerned. A whole new friend group. Suddenly very materialistic. Finding out about more 'secrets' and stuff going on that she hasn't told us.

    "title": "Eight Year Old's Issues are Draining Us",
    "self_text": "We have an 8 1/2 year old son who we love to the moon. He has also been what I would call a \"high needs\" child since day one. He was a terrible sleeper and constant waker until age 3. Then at age 4, we started getting weekly reports from the daycare that he was hitting or tackling other children when they didn't play the way he wanted or they got something he didn't have. After speaking to our pediatrician, we began taking him to occupational therapy at age 5 and then began getting him talk therapy at age 6. Just before he turned 8 this year, we had him evaluated by a pediatric neuropsychologist who diagnosed him with Non-Verbal Learning Disability (NVLD). He had an off-the-charts verbal IQ (she said it was the highest she had tested in 20 years of doing this) with firmly average to low-average scores in a number of other areas including visual/spacial processing, reaction time, etc. Her feeling was that because he was so gifted in a number of academic areas and was firmly average to low-average in several other areas, that disconnect fueled his anxiety and anger.  I just feel that we are trying everything we can to help him and nothing seems to work. The same things that were issues at 4 years old are still issues at 8 1/2 years old. We try hard to limit screen time (30 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes in the evening after homework is done on weekdays) and a bit more on weekends, but without a device he constantly complains that he is bored and that someone needs to play with him. He still doesn't have the capability of helping himself feel at ease. Compare this with our other son who could entertain himself for hours with magna-tiles, coloring, puzzles, sidewalk chalk, etc.  He has an ENORMOUS fear of missing out which has existed since pre-school. If he hears that another kid did something he hasn't done (i.e. a trip to Disney), has something he doesn't have (i.e. an Xbox) or is participating in an activity that he didn't know about, he will not drop the subject or accept no for an answer. We have had circular arguments that have gone on for hours and he has expressed extensively how he feels we hate him and nobody is ever nice to him and he never gets anything he wants. The thing is, he gets more than most kids his age but any experiences we have or any item he receives, by the next day it seems like he has wiped it from his brain and now he needs his next \"hit.\"  We're exhausted. Every day is filled with activities now - baseball, basketball, hockey, cub scouts, occupational therapy, regular therapy, events at the elementary school, PTA fundraisers, optional school projects, optional community projects or contests - if we don't do absolutely all of them he gets EXTREMELY upset. If we have occupational therapy one night and he can't go to basketball practice, he gets EXTREMELY upset. We started with a new therapist last month and the prospect of going to see him is torturous for our son and he is constantly asking how much longer he has to go. I just feel like I'm at my wits end and I'm deeply concerned about the fact that it just doesn't seem like he's made progress these last four years, but I don't know what else I can do to help him. He just seems so unhappy so often.  I'm just hoping that one day it all resolves out of nowhere.",

(she will literally not sleep unless she's on her pillow and has either a specific song playing or rain sounds.)

I'm not looking for safe sleep advice as I'm very much open with my pediatrician and she's aware of how my baby sleeps. We aren't worried about this causing a \"lack of independence\" either so I'm not looking for advice to transition either. I follow the ss7 except for the pillow usage and I'm almost up every hour checking on her.   I know this is a controversial subject for some but I don't have anyone to really talk to about need sharing outside of Reddit, so if you're against bed sharing please don't comment about it...

I'm absolute miserable and hopeless and deeply depressed.  *As you can see,... the numbers are not working out.*  &#x200B;  Father  - Lives in (no joke) EUR 5 million penthouse with au pair room, rooms for each kid  - Has ski apartment, lake house, and country house  - can send the kids to private schools  - Childless live-in girlfriend who \"wants to be a step-mother\"  - Loves to party and drink, was not an involved father during our marriage  - Was only an involved father when he took the kids to his parents with his new girlfriend/mistress. He was 1000x a better father with his girlfriend than he was with me.  If the kids live with him, I can go freelance with my job- earn about 300k traveling 90% of the time and having almost no expenses. I would rent a room in a shared apartment near an airport. I can get tons of points and savings to go on vacations and visit the kids. I would only have to pay $900/month child support no matter how often I saw the kids.

I've been using the Google Family Link app to control tablet time, and have had good success with that.  TVs are another story. We have 3, and they're all linked to a Roku device. I'm wanting to do something like having them all go offline at 8:30 unless there's a parental override? The Roku app doesn't seem to have any features like this.  Can anyone suggest a way? Thanks",

    "self_text": "My daughter will be 5 months next week (adjusted age 2 months). She is super clingy. For some background knowledge, she wasn’t always this way. When she was about a month old I was experiencing a really rough time in my life (homeless, just got out of an abusive relationship, the works) so I safe haven surrendered her. A few weeks later when I was in a more stable mental state I really I made the wrong decision and went through DCFS to try and get her back and I eventually did. Ever since she got back she has been absolutely inconsolable when I am not holding her or in the same room as her. I understand babies naturally desire to be close to their moms but it feels a little extreme in my case.  If I am not near her she will not stop crying until I am there to comfort her. She was in daycare for about a week and everyday she would cry until she wore herself out and eventually fell asleep. It got to a point where I didn’t feel comfortable leaving her there because I felt like I was abusing her by doing so. I had to quit my job and luckily I found a remote position but I don’t know how long it will be sustainable. She is now exclusively breastfed because she quickly began to refuse bottles. She will also only fall asleep if I am holding her and will cry as soon as she is put down. I don’t know if she has separation anxiety or if she’s even old enough to experience that. I do know that I have not had more than 10 minutes alone in the past couple of months and I’m exhausted. The guilt is consuming me as i feel like I traumatized her. I can’t stand to listen to her cry because I feel like it will traumatize her further if I do. However I am interested in going back to school at some point as well as other things. I don’t know if this will last forever and I don’t know what to do.",

    "self_text": "I posted on relationships advice but they were pretty judgemental and didn't really help.   So, I have ptsd. And I have a 3 month old. And a toddler (f3)   You can imagine how hormonal and tired I am.  I have very little patience for my toddler and she, like every toddler, has lots of energy. She screams, dances, hops, runs. But the hardest for me is she touches me. And not in a nice way. When my husband is at work, i keep myself together, try very hard to be understanding with her. This is the most tiring for me, I'd rather be up every other hour in the night than deal with her energy, but I do it for her sake. When my husband comes back, I have no more energy for her. I still feed her and do whatever she physically needs but I can't deal with the touch and screaming at me no more. I ask \"please take a step back away from me\" but she doesn't listen, she wants my full attention. And every evening it's the same thing. I ask my husband to support me, to tell her to be nice to me, that I am angry and touched out, but he says \"it's your problem, you should be more patient\" or \"I shouldn't intervene between you and her, you're the parent as much as me, it'll sound to her like I'm the\" bad cop\", or the parent who decides, or like you need protection from her\" and it sounds like an accusation, like I don't love her anymore, or like I'm a bad parent. He knows I have ptsd, I can't help it. He acts like everything's normal, like before the birth, like I'm not hormonal. He doesn't seem to understand what it's like. And every night we argue about it.  I'm so so tired.  This is what I posted but I want to add here   I see a psychiatrist and an therapist, I'm not on meds because i function (I have ptsd, not cptsd for who knows the difference). The therapist helps me, and gives advice like to distract her but it gets hard to apply by the end of the day.  I understand that a toddler can't understand what it means that I need my personal space (though I think children should understand that at some point, i just don't know at what age) that's why I'm asking for advice",

    "self_text": "I am a single mom. My daughter is 8 years old, her dad and I are divorced but we get along great. He is more or less an absent father. He visits her once or twice a month and supports economically when he has a steady job (which is not a constant thing). I support my daughter alone but I receive a lot of help from my parents. Since my daughter was born, my mom has been overprotective of her and it has influenced my daughter's behavior. Whenever I try to teach my daughter skills to be independent, such as: brushing her hair or teeth, dressing up alone, etc... she starts whining or crying, and knows that whenever I try to disciple her, she can cry hard enough for my mom/sister/father to intervene and shut me down.   This happens in all other areas too. When I reprimand my daughter for misbehaving, my parents will back her up and then proceed to admonish me for not \"disciplining her in a correct way\" or commenting that \"She is just a child\"....  This has been a constant for ever.... I've talked to my parents in private begging them to stop. I've warned them that they are creating a monster. I've told them that when my daughter becomes a stinky self centered manipulating teenager with no respect for my guidance or authority, no one will want to be with her. I will have to deal with the monster alone. That if they love us, they have to stop siding with my daughter.  Nothing works.  I get so mad when my authority or directions are questioned in front of my daughter that I just explode. So to make matters worse, I go berserk when my parents intervene in front of my daughter... furthering the damage already inflicted. Today, I was teaching my daughter how to brush her hair. She did not want to do it. So she started crying and asking \"for help\". I know my daughter... she was just being lazy. I kept my resolve and insisted that she had to brush her hair. Things started to get heated because my daughter talked back at me... thats when my mom came into the room... as usual my daughter upped the volume of her crying and my mom, as usual, intervened. I tried to explain that my daughter is 8 years old and needs to be more independent. My mom, instead of supporting my position, took my daughter's side and said  \"it looks as if you take pleasure in watching your daughter cry\".. .. this infuriated me horribly. I just stormed out of the room and said \"I am leaving, I had it with this none-sense\"  My daughter was freaking out because she saw how I went berserk. I could not back to my mother or be disrespectful... so I chose \"violence\" towards the world. Just left the room in total anger.  My seething anger simmered for almost an hour. I was also worried because I know how my mom operates. She was going to tell my father about the incident and then I would have ANOTHER conflict to deal with.  After an hour or so, my mom comes back and tells my daughter \"you know, my mom brushed my hair until I was 12 years old\".....   Just to back up a bit. My grandmother on my mother's side, abused me emotionally. She said the most horrible things to me while I was a child, consequently crushing my self esteem.  No one ever defended me from her. I was always in the wrong and guilty of whatever I was or was not doing. I never received an apology or an excuse of why they just let an adult treat me like shit for so many years.  Why do my parents constantly admonish my efforts to teach my daughter the basic skills of life. I am not as half as bad as what my grandmother did and said to me.... For me all of this is so confusing, heartbreaking and infuriating at the same time.  More importantly... what about my daughter? she has to witness her mom going berserk, I say awful things to her out of desperation, she sees how my mom and I argue. And what about her acquisition of life skills like perseverance, competence and self sufficiency.  Currently, my daughter and I are seeing a therapist to help her out with some anxiety and bullying at school. Regretfully, my mom does not believe in therapy and there is no psychologist or family therapist on earth who could make her see the damage she is inflicting on us.  Sorry for the long rant/post, but I had to vent. If anyone wants to share a common experience or give advice, is more than welcome to do so.",

Several of the kids took a screen shot and showed their parents who then emailed the school with concerns.  I absolutely know that this was not appropriate for her to send, even when she didn't mean it (it's kind of a family thing, we watch a lot of b movie horror and it's kind of affected our family lexicon, but i need to make it more clear to her that what flies in our home, doesn't work outside with people who don't know the context )and I will be speaking to her about it.  My issue is, that the school has said that there will be consequences, from their end and I'm not sure it's their place to give her consequences a) for something that happened outside of school b) without my input.

Finally the symptoms progressed to a point that I could research them and I, me, little old ME found the proper diagnosis and we pushed for treatment.

    "title": "Signs of Aspergers in 3 year old?",
    "self_text": "What are some signs of Aspergers and what are some ways in which one as a parent can start to intervene?  We've been watching our daughter, who turned 3 in October, start exhibiting strange behavior, and we're not sure how to start addressing it - people tell us a lot of this is normal but something doesn't feel right.  We've observed significant regression in her speech patterns, but she learned to speak very young (at 1) and was very advanced for her age until recently so her regression means that she is now still within range of normal for her age, yet she used to talk a lot more and more clearly.  Many of her strange behaviors, such as her obsessions and compulsions, are things that people assure us are \"normal toddler behavior\", but something feels wrong to us.  One thing we have noticed is selective mutism.  She talks all day to us, in full sentences, with a remarkable vocabulary, but as soon as someone else is around, she either gets really really quiet or makes unintelligible noises with only occasional words.  The thing that compelled me to write this post is that when I went to pick her up from daycare today, her caretaker happened to overhear her talk to me about the sign-out book (one of her obsessions), and seemed surprised that she talked at all!  She called another worker over.  \"Look!  She talks!  And she talks really well too.\"  At first I didn't realize that they were talking about my daughter and when I realized it, it hit me like a ton of bricks.  The main thing we noticed is her obsession with routines, and with keeping things within routines.  She has certain rituals that we must abide by, otherwise there are huge meltdowns.  For example, we have to go through a very specific scripted conversation, with me standing in a very specific place (she positions me within centimeters) before we brush her teeth at night.  If I deviate in the script or in my standing position, she loses it.  And she doesn't let things go.  Most kids can be distracted from something, but she doesn't forget and she keeps coming back to it.  Her daycare lost a dress of hers, she's really not taking it well, and she's not forgetting it.  She has an intense attachment to her clothes.  She has full tantrum meltdowns if she needs to be changed in the middle of the day or the middle of the night.  She insists on wearing the soiled clothes.  Even socks that have gotten wet and muddy, she refuses to take off.  It has just gotten worse as she has gotten older.  I put on a shirt with different pants than I usually match the shirt with, and when she realized it mid morning at pre-school, she lost it and didn't let it go all day.  She has trouble with fine motor skills, and seems to just get frustrated when encouraged to practice or shown how to hold a pencil.  She used to be very enthusiastic to learn.  She is extremely stubborn.  She refuses to use the toilet.  When she uses it, she insists on taking off her pants and pull-ups completely off her legs.  She has huge meltdowns if you try to keep her pants on up to her knees or ankles. She refuses to accept new ways of doing things.  Many of these things could be the result of our situation since the pandemic. We have been very isolated.  We moved to where we currently live shortly before the pandemic, so we don't have close-by family or friends nearby.  We don't have a social network here.  We are also older parents, in our 40s, and our daughter is the only child on both sides of our family - I'm an only child and my husband has two unmarried older sisters.  So, we are just not around children.  It's been hard since the pandemic because my husband is immunocompromised, so we are still taking precautions and not participating in indoor social events.   We do take her to pre-school and daycare because we realize that she needs to have a social life, but I wonder if not having a social life at home is hindering her social development at school.  I noticed her interactions with other kids is awkward.  She doesn't seem to read them.  She talks to them when they are ignoring her, she ignores them when they seek her attention.  At school, she's usually doing her own thing in the playground, which seems strange to me because with us she is very social and interactive and involves us in her play.  EDIT TO ADD: Yes, I understand that Reddit cannot give me an evaluation, and we do plan to see a child psychologist to get her evaluated. Of course we are seeking professional help, that's not what this post is for.  I was just curious to hear/read your thoughts and experiences with similar issues.",

I have considered before that he might have autism. But he is social, speaks well, reads emotions well, functions like an average (young, slightly immature, male) sixth grader and gets pretty good grades in advanced classes. He plays with kids on our neighborhood, goes to sleepovers, enjoys video games, is on a soccer team. I fear that being told he has autism would crush him.  Do I have anything to gain by having him formally diagnosed? Would I be doing him a disservice by ignoring it? What would you do??",

Strangers stop me daily in stores and outings to say how gorgeous my oldest daughter is. No mention of the youngest. And it’s not the normal polite “your daughter is so cute”. They stop and stare and act like their minds are blown by her beauty. And that’s so nice, sort of, but it breaks my heart for my other daughter who is also standing there. They’re young enough still that it’s not a big deal to them but it won’t be long.   How do I keep my youngest daughter from feeling less beautiful than her sister and protect their sister relationship?  Edit: daughters are 7 and 4.",

    "title": "Nanny Drama - What would you do?",
    "self_text": "Both me and my spouse work full time. We have a nanny come to watch our 2 year old during the week. We have a cleaning person come once per week- usually Friday or Sunday. We live in a two bedroom apartment in New York. We currently pay $25/hour for the nanny and pretty much live paycheck to paycheck outside of our retirement savings and money we have put aside for the child's education.   We have had this nanny for over a year. At the one year mark my spouse went back to work full time and we considered sending our child to day care for half days so he would be exposed to other children. The nanny said she could not reduce her hours (day care would have meant 8 hours/week cut from her schedule). After much debate, we decided to opt in for more nanny time rather than day care and signed him up for a weekend class to play with other kids.  At this point we noticed an attitude shift from the nanny, particularly towards our pet. The nanny started complaining about the dog jumping on her when she arrived and sometimes peeing to punish us/her for leaving her alone in the apartment. (The dog has bad separation anxiety).   We opted to pay for additional dog training and went every Tuesday after work for 2 months. It didn't really help since the behavior is anxiety based. She already knew how to sit/lie down etc.   Last week the dog peed again and the nanny sent us a picture of the pee on the floor saying \"we need to talk.\"   After a weekend of worrying she was going to give us an ultimatum of the dog or her, she sent us an email, filled with criticism that was completely new to us. In the year and 4 months we have worked with her, we had never heard her complain about the cleanliness of the apartment, the child's food options (we normally have eggs, yogurt, fruit, Gerber's microwavable meals and fruit squeezes) or the child's laundry.   The email was basically the nanny requesting a raise, citing the additional duties she has taken beyond caring for the child. These include keeping the house clean, doing laundry and offering meal prep for the child... and us. She attempts to justify this request for more money by saying she is taking on the role of a house keeper as well.   The concerning part is that she says she had almost quit on multiple occasions, which is completely shocking to us. If we had known she was on the brink of quitting, we would have opted for full time day-care as we were considering this past August.   As mentioned, we already have a house keeper come once per week. We don't make a ton of money and so the idea of paying more for someone to like.... cook our meals is really not something we had anticipated. I was particularly taken back by the tone. She is normally overly bubbly and friendly and then suddenly in this email she is saying that she \"cringes\" when she sees our child has slept in his clothes. (I'm not saying it's right for the kid to sleep in his day time clothes but it's not like he is living in squalor.)   Generally speaking i'm willing to pay more for additional tasks, but there is part of me that feels like she is overstepping and that her tone has crossed a line. It kind of feels like a shake down.  In addition to paying her more she would like us to get a dog walker.  How would you respond?",

He was coming into our bed every night since then when he woke, but in the last 2 weeks I put my foot down and won’t bring him in no matter what.   This has lead to some nights of a brief wake of 20 mins once, or most night of multiple wakes that can be 20 mins to last night 1.5h.   I am at a loss of what to do. I can’t avoid being in his line of sight as he will shout and scream, we have a student from another country living with us as well as teen kid who goes to school.   This weekend I am going to try and just ignore it and see if he goes back to sleep alone eventually (the student is going away for the weekend).   I’ve tried the Ferber method as it originally worked well for us a few times but since this latest regression it’s not working. He’s gotten so worked up he’d bang his head on the door (which is open and a baby gate on the frame), scream, vomit, try to climb the gate etc.   Any advice would be great.

We’ll be getting him therapy and he a lady has amazing tutor.   What I’m hoping for help with is has anyone found some great resources to teach either him and/or us success strategies for him?

I need some advice regarding my 2yo son - he was always a terrible sleeper, but now, since 2nd child is on his way we have to do something so our life doesn't become an utter nightmare. He hasn't ever sleeped through the night, waking up 2-5 times per night. Most often he doesn't even fully wake at the beginning, just starts squeeking and calling 'mom' then progressing to crying unless he is given a bottle. My wife stopped breastfeeding when he was 1,5y or something, we've been cosleeping until some 2-3months ago when we finally finished his room - he falls asleep eagerly in his own bed, but during the night at the point of 3rd or 4th wake up we just move him to our bed. I know he doesn't need milk because he's hungry, its just for comfort, but other ways of comforting him (reading, talking, singing etc.) don't work - he just starts screaming and goes on for 15-30mins and then falls back asleep (or not). We discussed different options of managing this situation with my wife, she is absolutely against the crying-out strategy but at this point i don't think I have any other idea. He is a healthy boy, developping properly, no medical issues whatsoever.   Has anyone of you had a similar problem? I'll be grateful for any advice.",

    "self_text": "I have a soon to be 5 year old stepdaughter who refuses to play by herself, unless someone is playing with her or watching her play - which turns into us playing anyway. I've been with her dad since just after she turned one, and she has always needed extra attention in my opinion (my opinion based off of watching my neices and nephews who are her age). We have her every other week Friday - Friday and we know that when at her mother's, a tablet or phone is thrown in her face and she's expected to entertain herself that way by watching videos or playing Roblox, or playing with her little sister (1 year old). Her mom does not engage in any play with her from what we've gathered. Mom is a whole different issue and we are currently in the middle of a custody battle that should be ending in December, so talking to mom about this is totally moot. Back to the point, in the last 2 years we have been struggling with encouraging independent play. She is an only child with us and we have designated a corner of our basement to be her \"play room\" in which we bought a foam puzzle piece mat for her to set up and play on. That was 3 months ago and even though most of the time we are in the basement, she plays even less now than she did before. We don't think the issue is overstimulation because she doesn't have that many toys, on purpose, so that she doesn't get overwhelmed by the choices. We try to limit tv and tablet time but she has shown a lot of interest in gaming which from time to time we allow her to do on her tablet or special games we've bought for the playstation. She has a decent Barbie collection, play dough, puzzles, kitchen play, sand, crafts, baby dolls, and a few other random toys. She will not touch any of it without our suggestion to do so. Instead she wants us to play games that she made up all day every day. We humor her and go along with these games that she makes up but the second we say okay we need a break why don't you play with your toys? She instantly wants to watch TV or has a meltdown. Thus, the toys are never played with unless her dad or I play with her. If we don't let her watch TV then she'll just follow us all over the house asking every five minutes if we can play with her. Sometimes we aren't doing anything important and just want to catch our breaths and that's when we feel the worst about telling her no because she can see that we aren't \"busy\", but we've already played so much with her and just need a break. At this point we are very sure that a lot of it has to do with the different parenting between mom's and dad's houses and that she isn't getting positive attention from her mother, but we have no idea what to do. I've bought her a very large dollhouse for Christmas in hopes that she will actually start playing by herself, but the closer we get to the holidays the more I worry I spent $250 on a dollhouse that will never be used. We like to play board games with her most nights before bed but she always gets bored halfway through, no matter what game we play. She just wants the TV or our attention. Any advice?",

We try to punish them by taking away gaming consoles and then within the hour the kids are right back on them. It makes me so mad and makes my blood literally boil when I see these things going on. I have tried and tried to push her to help these children start to grow and become more “try to figure things on my own first and then ask for help” as opposed to “tell mom idk what to do and let her do it for me” and it’ll work for a few days then right back to the same old song and dance. She doesn’t follow through on any sort of disciplinary actions and doesn’t care clearly if the children blatantly ignore any punishment thrown their way. It wasn’t like this when her and I first met but has slowly progressed to this point. I have tried time and time again to say my peace or intervene and back her up when I feel the children just ignore her but nothing works.

So far this year she didnt cough in June and most of July however, by the end of July things got back to constant coughing. I am so annoyed by anyone that tells me this is normal. This shouldn't be normal. Mid October her cough got so bad that she was having nose bleeds and coughing up blood. I have spent so much money on Urgent cares and nobody does anything. No prescription, no in depth checkups but just a \"she is fine\" and \" its normal\" is all I get. I have taken her to the ER and nothing. I always get sent back without any hope.   She vomits almost every other night because of her cough. This is so annoying y'all! I understand that kids get sick a lot. I get it! But this is not normal. She has been in daycare/school since her first year.   I cant believe that there isnt something they can do and that i just have to have her suffer like this.   I have tried essential oils, natural and herbal syrups, otc meds, cool mist humidifiers, sleeping in a sitting position, vicks, teas... I feel like i have tried everything and she just doesnt get better.   I would honestly love for a doctor to care enough to dig deeper and check that she is okay internally instead of just sending us home..",

    "self_text": "My sons (9yo and 13yo) have been saying they are scared of their dad. They say they are not scared of me at all😅 Their dad has never been physical abusive to me or the kids but he often questioned them (and me) in a very intimidating way when they made some mistakes such as they didn’t do good at the baseball game etc. Last month my 9yo came to me crying and I asked why. He said, “My headphones (gifted from his dad) are not working. Daddy is gonna get mad at me.”  My sons spend weekends with their dad and last couple Saturdays my younger one was throwing up before soccer games. This all started since he threw up in his dad car after the soccer game 3 weeks ago. I take him to soccer practice during the week and he has no issues so I’m really wondering if their dad got angry and now my son is so scared of going to soccer games with his dad.  If I say something to his dad he will get mad at me and say “ I wasn’t mad. You are making things worse etc etc.” I made an appointment to get a therapy for my son. What else I can do for him? Also how can I talk to their dad about this?",

    "self_text": "My son (3) spent the night at my in-law’s last Thursday and when I picked him up from preschool on Friday I noticed his bangs were cut.  He was growing it out bc he said he wanted it long. It was almost to the point that he could tuck it behind his ears, but was getting in his eyes while playing. I don’t think she did it maliciously but I also think she knew what she was doing. She usually sends tons of pics when my kids spend the night and she only sent a couple from far away. I did think the lack of pics were strange but didn’t think too much of it. Looking at them now zoomed in, I can def tell it’s shorter. He now looks like he has a mullet! When his hair was swept over to the side it was so cute!   I asked my husband if she asked him if she could cut it and he said no. He’s supposed to talk to her about it but he doesn’t understand and thinks it’s just hair. 🙄 But it’s not about the hair! It’s about the boundary she crossed!! I mean, who the hell cuts someone else’s kid’s hair?!! I’m livid!!   Ugh ok, rant over!!  Edit: Thank you everyone for the support! I was questioning if I was overreacting, but now know i was not! Thank you so so so much!!  My husband did talk to her and she will not be doing it again. Visits will be supervised for the time being.",

    "title": "How do tell your 4yo you’re getting rid of the dog?",
    "self_text": "I’m sure I’m going to get a lot of judgment for this post. It’s probably deserved. This is a really shitty situation. Posting from a throwaway account.   TL;DR: we got a dog that is not a good fit for the family and is ruining the house and the husbands mood. I think it’s time to find her a new family. But I don’t know how to tell 4yo. What do we tell him?   This summer we got a 6+ year old dog who was a former breeding dog. She’s not very well trained and seems too old/stubborn/dumb to really learn any house manners. I was pregnant at the time and thought the dog was a bad idea for us right now. But my husband had really been pushing for a dog for a while and I gave in.   Well, it was a bad idea. I don’t feel like we have the time for this dog. She makes life so much harder. We’ve really tried. But we have so much on our plates and she just feels like extra work we don’t have time for. The straw that broke the camels back.   Also, she really pisses off my husband. His fuse is just so short with her. Like I said, full plates. Lots of stress. Every time she doesn’t listen when he wants her to come or stay or whatever, he yells. Then she gets scared and confused and does the opposite of what he wants. Often breaking something or making a mess in her confusion. One example we’ll be outside and run in for something. Don’t want the dog to go inside and be left alone in the house. But she’ll barrel past and shove her way inside, knocking down anything in her path. This escalates to husband yelling more and dragging the dog out to tie her up outside for hours as punishment.  She deserves better than this. I wish he had more patience. I wish she was easier to train. Obviously this dog and my husband are not a good match. I feel like this has gone on long enough. I’d hoped it would get better, but it hasn’t. I’m so tired of it.   I really feel like it’s what’s best for our family, and the dog, to get rid of her. I need peace in my house again. But I feel really awful and guilty about how my son might feel. He’s not even super attached. He mostly likes to chase and wrestle the poor dog. Not really interested in caring for her. But he’s 4 so that’s probably normal. He’s in the “why phase.” He will repeatedly ask why, why, why. Every answer provoking another “why?” I don’t know what we’ll tell him to give him closure, and not have to explain 800 times. Do we give him a version of the truth? She was misbehaved, we couldn’t keep her. He’ll ask why. Well, we didn’t want to deal with her anymore. Why? She was stressing dad out. Why? He’s overworked and has a short temper. Why, why, why? This seems like more than we can expect a 4yo to comprehend. I almost want to just say “sorry, she ran away. I don’t know why, buddy.” Rather than try to get him to understand how she was just too much work for us. I just don’t know what the least damaging explanation is. Any advice?",

    "self_text": "I’m a graduate student (set to graduate with my Master’s in March) and a father to a 7-month old. One of my friends invited me and a mutual friend to an activity on a day of the week where I’m already gone from home for 9 hours. I declined because I didn’t feel like paying $50 to be away from my wife and son for an extra 2+ hours more than I already would be. The mutual friend got passive-aggressive with me being like “it’s not outrageously expensive if you see it as getting to spend an afternoon with friends” and then proceeded to say they were worried about me not taking time to myself between academics and family-raising. Apparently their parents wish they hung out with their friends more, so they didn’t want to see me live with the same regrets. But my son is only 7 months old and I feel bad being at school away from him and my wife as it is; why would I want to spend even more time away from them? Was mostly just wanting to rant, but I’m curious how y’all handled being with childless friends when your kids were/are young and if/when you started partaking in hobbies with friends",

My wife was reeaaaally hoping for at least one girl as she would love to have a mother-daughter experience as well. We find out today during 16week US that we’re having twin boys!  We’re excited and happy to have a big-ish family as we are financially secure and this was definitely planned. However, I hate that I’m feeling depressed that my wife won’t get to have the mom-daughter experience she’s wanted and I know she is feeling it as well but is keeping it inside, and I kno we should be thankful to have a healthy set of twins. But damn man idk why this is hitting me kinda hard knowing we won’t get to experience raising a girl. We are open to a 4th but only by adoption.  If anyone has or is experiencing this I would love to hear your perspective thanks.",

    "self_text": "My 5 year old’s eating habits have been driving me crazy. I feel like I’m failing him and making him a bad eater somehow. He’s just so dang picky and it’s driving us nuts.   Breakfast and lunch are usually pretty kid-friendly foods. Bagels, cereal, waffles, eggs, fruit, toast, etc. Lots of peanut butter. Lunch is often sandwiches, avocado toast, Mac and cheese, grilled cheese, fruit, cucumbers, chicken nuggets, etc. Sometimes I let him choose which meal he’d like, sometimes I choose. There’s rarely a fight and he typically eats something if not everything.   Dinner is another story. We’ve always made one meal for the family. He’s gotten pickier and pickier as the years go on. I feel like we follow all the typical “rules.” We don’t offer anything else. We always put a “safe” food on the plate. He loves dipping in ranch and sour cream so that’s usually out. Unless it’s pasta with butter, he rarely eats. Anything that has lots of ingredients seems even less likely (casseroles, soups, tacos, curry, etc). And besides chicken tenders and deli meat, he won’t touch meat. We don’t make a big deal if he does or doesn’t eat. I feel so defeated every night when he leaves the table having almost nothing.   My mom always prided herself in raising us kids to not be picky (and we weren’t!). What am I doing wrong?!",

    "title": "9 year old always worried about having access to a bathroom",
    "self_text": "This is a relatively new (last 6 months or so) development for my 9 year old daughter.  She has an almost impulsive worry about needing to have access to a bathroom.  She's never had an accident that could explain why she's so worried about it, and she admits that it's 100% mental and not anything physically wrong.  She has no pain or irritation when she urinates, and she sleeps through the night with no urge to wake up and urinate.  She hasn't had an accident in at least 5 years.  Her frequency at home varies wildly.  If we're doing something fun/distracting, she'll only go every 2-3 hours.  But then there are times she seems to fixate on it and she goes every 30 minutes.  I think she goes less frequently at school because she knows she'll attract attention of the teacher if she does, but she probably goes 3-4 times during school hours.  If we are going anywhere new, the first thing she asks is \"Is there a bathroom?\"  She'll also go at least two times right before we leave the house.  This has started to become a problem for us as a family.  We went trick or treating in our neighborhood and about 20 minutes in she insisted she had to go to the bathroom urgently.  I had to walk back to the house with her while her younger sister and my husband kept going.  She missed about half of the houses.  We are also doing a paid activity later this month with extended family that will take 60-90 minutes.  If this activity has started and you need to leave to go to the bathroom, there is no re-entry and you miss the rest.  I know she'll ask to go to the bathroom in the middle of it.  I'll be honest, there is a lot of frustration around this from all of us which I'm sure isn't helping her.  Since I'm the mom, I'm the one doing 99% of the bathroom trips with her when we're out.  I don't feel comfortable sending her to the bathroom by herself yet (and she doesn't either), so I'm the one that has to stop eating if we're at a restaurant or frantically hunt down a bathroom if we're at a store.  She says this is mental and I concur.  She is a very anxious kid in general and this seems to be the \"thing\" she's worried about most right now.  How do I help her?  I've told her that she can limit what she drinks 30 minutes before we leave, and I've explained that she's never had an issue with this before and that she is capable of holding it.  She acknowledges that is true, but is still worried.  When I ask  why  she's worried, she just says that she doesn't want to have an accident.  I feel like our conversations just go in circles.",

It stopped last time was in June. Then couple weekends a go she went baking with her grannie and when I got home from going out myself she said she had tummy ache, maybe from eating too much I thought then I asked if she felt sick she started panicking more and shouting at me because I was overwhelming her I think and told me not to talk and ran to toilet panicking. I left her to it until she calmed down and asked what was wrong and why was she shouting she said it’s because she was worried incase she was sick.   friday she was going to her friends house after school. She had fallen at school and grazed her knee pretty bad but when I went to get her to take her to her friend and her mum she was pale shivering stomach ache. I asked what was wrong she said she thinks she was nervous. but she was so excited to go to her friends as I said we can rearrange and she really didn’t want to do that. When she got there she was fine and she got home and she was fine.   we went to polar express today she never knew but she had stomach ache all way there I asked if she felt sick she shrugged and I handed her a bag incase and she was shouting at me again don’t do that I don’t want that take it away. Like it was making the situation worse, we stopped at McDonald’s and she went to toilet for b/m it went away, then came back on when she had eaten then started to eat again and then was fine when we returned home.   is this anxiety and stress related? How do I help her with this. We went to gp for swollen lympnode in neck a while ago and was told they were fine and eventually went away and she also had stomach checked I mentioned her stomach aches at the time and she said said could be anxiety or constipated but said her stomach felt fine.   i sometimes feel like maybe she can’t process the stomach pain and it makes her panic more and maybe she doesn’t want to be sick so she has a panic attack over it as she literally goes into melt down and shouts at us if we talk to her. Do I just leave her until it goes away?   i get anxiety poops and I have since I was little I remember everytime I went swimming I’d get those stomach ache. Wonder if she’s taking after me.   thanks for your help",

My director sent in my application to HR for the approval and unfortunately heard today it was denied because recently they decided to let go almost half of the employees at the company and there is no longer a budget to hire a team under me for 2023, because i'd have no team I don't qualify for a manager title.  my director still fought for me and offered me a 14% raise which I happily accepted, except my vision of being a manager and then having a baby and going on a maternity leave knowing in the back of my head I reached my career goal at this time is upsetting me.   I was promised the later half of next year that they would be able to work the budget to be able to hire someone under me and finally giving me the title I deserve. But I can't be sure considering a promise has already been broken at this time and I don't want to wait again to have a baby. I feel like I put a hold on my family planning for my career for it to just not work out the way I hoped it would.   i'd love to hear from you ladies to help me feel better about this situation. I want to try for a baby soon and this is just bothering me.",

These were the principles I was brought up under in my house, and my parents, especially my mum, made sure me and my brother adhered to them. Which is why I was very excited when I had my baby to make sure my parents, and my wife's parents, were around their only grandkid as much as possible. To be raised with discipline, with composure, with adherence to the highest standards of a civil, liberal democratic society...  Except that it's the opposite.   A scoop of ice cream after daycare? Please, one? Don't be ridiculous. Minimum 2 are in order. Me drilling the idea of \"you can get off your seat when you're done eating, and it's OK to do it now but then there's no more food\" into my kid's head? Oh hush, don't be silly. Hot dog in front of the TV is the order of the evening now, constantly getting off the sofa to point out at something this bloody peppa pig is doing at his grandma. Forget about fun activities to learn new skills or socially connect after daycare. Who needs those when you can just sit like a zombie in front of the TV for 90 minutes. A harmonious social setting at home with the grandparents and parents and child all laughing and playing together? Oh, so naive and sweet, unless by harmonious and laughing you mean torturously witnessing my wife argue with her parents for the nth time over why they promised our toddler TV again or gave him ice cream or a number of other \"vices\".   But I'm in control of my own child's upbringing and shaping his behaviour, am I not?  Am I not?  Edit: after a couple of replies, it dawned to me that this is the internet and that people may not get the true message here /be judgmental/point out the obvious. I'm doing this for sympathy, yes, but only some. The rest of it is just for giggles. We and my child are lucky that he has 4 living grandparents who adore him and spoil him from time to time. As parents, my wife and I may not always agree with their methods, but we can't expect them to do exactly as we tell them 100% and all of the time.",

    "self_text": "My 2 year old daughter has had a big double ear infection for approximately a month. She has started two types of antibiotics. The first was a chewable because at the time the only medication she would take at all was chewable. Halfway through she began to refuse, and would also taste when I would mix it in her drink. We had to switch to a liquid antibiotic, and pretty much force it in her in small amounts. But about 2 days in, she began throwing up immediately after. I’m at the point where the only way I can get any medicine in her system is Feverall suppository. However, I don’t want this to be her only experience with medication. I’m concerned she has sensory and eating difficulty, which will take time to develop.  Here’s the issue. My partner, her father, did something that bothered me tremendously. We have the rest of the chewable antibiotics. I told him at this point we need to go back to grinding them up and mixing them into her drinks, in smaller amounts. Not five minutes later, he came back while I was changing her diaper. She is lying on her back on the floor. He pushes half the chewable into her mouth, she keeps trying to spit it out. He asked me if it’s dissolvable, I tell him no. But he keeps trying, even after I told him to stop. Eventually, it gets lodged back into her throat. She began to cough, as she was beginning to choke. I pat her back and she vomited it up.   He got upset because I was clearly upset with him for this. I didn’t say a word, I just couldn’t in that moment. I knew his hope was that she would begin to chew it. I have had so many issues with him and my other two children, with him pushing them to achieve milestones before they are ready.  A disclaimer: I am in the process of figuring out how to leave this relationship because of things like this. I have zero family or friends nearby, and I am disabled/unemployed. So the reason I haven’t yet is strictly financial.   My question is, am I getting too upset about this particular incident? I know his intention was to help. However, I feel very strongly that he should have known at least to stop forcing it when she began to reject chewing the medication, strictly out safety.",

    "self_text": "Yesterday my 13-yr old son had his first day of coed soccer practice in 8th grade. He loves playing soccer with friends and in PE, but hasn’t ever played soccer or any other sport competitively on a team. I haven’t ever played competitive sports so am trying to understand if his experience was typical, because it was awful.  Since we recently moved to the area, we weren’t able to get his sports physical scheduled until Tuesday; so Wednesday was his first day of practice. I reached out to the coach on Monday asking for a schedule and any other information regarding what we should expect and what will be required, but only received confirmation about my son’s eligibility and no answers to any of my questions.  We live in the suburbs of Seattle and yesterday it was pouring rain and 40 degrees at 3pm when practice started. I saw that the sports from last season practiced until 5pm, so we expected the same. Due to the stormy weather and freezing temperatures, I expected that they’d be practicing drills in the gym adjacent to the soccer field. His cleats and shin guards haven’t arrived yet, so he just wore sneakers and gym clothes.  I work in the city until 5 and wouldn’t be able to pick him up until 5:20, so was surprised when he texted me at 4:20 telling me that practice was over. Additionally, practice had been outside so he was soaked and the doors to the school were locked so he was stuck outside in the freezing cold. Turns out there was some confusion and he and a small group of kids were allowed to go inside for a bit, but were kicked out again at 5.  My son is trans and has been welcomed by most of his peers and gym class has been amazing. Almost no comments at all ever in the locker room during gym (they only undress to their underwear and don’t shower, but I’m still very impressed), but it was completely different at soccer practice. The boys were incredibly rude and said many transphobic jokes that upset him terribly and the bullying prevented him from using the locker room to change back into his dry street clothes.   When I arrived to pick him up he burst into tears that he had been holding back. He was FREEZING cold, soaking wet, and truly miserable. He kept his mouth shut and never complained to his coach. It was an awful experience that I wouldn’t want anybody to go through and am concerned it may have discouraged him from trying any other organized competitive sports.  Is this typical?

I have been on my own since I was 11 and had my first when I was 13 due to being SA. I finally got out of a few years long abusive relationship 2 years ago and have been single ever since. I was never really a \"good\" mother but I definitely wasn't this bad. I gave and give them more than they could ever want/need, we have themed weekly nights (ex Monday movie night, a night for 11 and I watch a show, Wednesday board game night etc etc.) I homeschooled them for 6 years and they are now in public school as of this year. So we definitely got quality time in. They have a good life they're in 2-3 extra curriculars, live in a single family home, never have to worry about food, fenced in yard, plays with friends and cousins every week. It's just me that is just undoing every good thing I've tried to do and causing them problems now.   I've been diagnosed with epilepsy and ended up the ICU twice last month and have been in the hospital 13 times since June. All due to seizures. I finally am on medication but I cannot control my moods. I am SO SO angry and sad. I cannot drive for 6 months and I haven't worked in a month. Driving was my happy place. I drove everywhere always taking the kids on adventures. Being busy with them helped me parent them. Now we are stuck in the house and I'm not good with them. I'm yelling/saying mean things, can't get out of bed much, low energy. I'm so alone. I just had 5 seizures last week. What do I do? How do I not completely mess them up? I don't want to be a mother. They deserve a better one and one that could provide a family. They are all good kids. I'm just not the one for them. I don't know who I am, I can't regulate my emotions anymore how can I help them, I'm now reliant on my boss, I am truly lost. I'm just showing them anger and they don't talk to each other nicely anymore.  I know it's been a lot lately for everyone. I'm aware of therapy and 2 of them just had their pediatrician appointment and I filled them in. I've told people close to me I don't want to be a mother anymore and how bad I am. Everyone just keeps saying how I'm their mother and they love me. It's not that bad. I can do it. Etc etc. None of that is going to be helpful if I destroy them :(",

Today he was having a rough day and was really misbehaving. I told him he does not get TV or dessert and he got so angry he threw something at me. I made him stand in the corner for 2 minutes and I told him if he acts up again I will throw away one of his toys. Later in the day he misbehaved so, wanting to be consequential, I picked out a toy he didn’t care much about and told him it’s going in the garbage. Now, I’m reading that this also may cause issues down the line.  So now I don’t know what to do.

    "self_text": "Lately, my youngest boys (almost 10 and 13) have no manners. They think it's hilarious to run through the house farting, belching as loud as they can, and smacking each other's bottoms. At meal time they scarf their food, lick their fingers; my youngest even licked his plate at one point  The behavior just kind of came out of nowhere. I understand that potty humor is pretty common for kids, especially boys. I really don't like it, nor does my husband, so we've always discouraged it. We've always taught them to go into another room to pass gas, to excuse yourself if you burp, and to have table manners. But lately, those rules are out the window   I guess my question is, what kind of consequence do you give for poor manners? Do I just ignore it? It feels petty to take away electronics over belching, or to put them in their room for licking their fingers. But I really want them to go back to being polite.",

    "self_text": "My child is about to be 4 and we have had behavioral difficulties since day 1 essentially. He would hit and bite everyone since about 18 months old. We have smoothed this out where he doesn't do this in most situations, but hitting still shows up a bit more than feels normal. Daycare however is apparently just not his thing.  We started daycare about 18 months ago to get him more social time as there are no kids close to his age in his life except a few times a year. Well we have basically been ran off from 3 daycares because once there he would start hitting and biting everyone every single day. We tried everything, they tried everything, and it's just not feasible for two working parents to leave work every single day to go pick him up so it was time to see what else could be done. We set up a behavioral assessment.   We've know there is some kind of neuro divergence but honestly sort of dragged our feet on this since we felt it was likely ADHD (I know they dont diagnose this early but if it walks like a hyperactive impulsive duck and talks like hyperactive impulsive duck).  I had work but my wife saw the psychologist for an interview and the psychologist said this sounds like a clear cut case of autism spectrum disorder since apparently his speech should be a bit further along too (4-5 word sentences for 98% despite word count being excellent and even able to spell and read several words).  Are there any books, youtube channels, or other resources that you recommend to help understand autism and/or parent a child with autism? I am sure the behavioral health team will have plenty of resources but they said getting insurance approval and all the other typical stuff means it will be about 3 months before our first actual appointment and I would like to start doing what I can in the mean time.",

He didn’t feel like my baby any longer and felt like a full-on child.   My second has been The Baby for the past three years, and even though she’s fully in the toddler years now, and even though she weighs a little over 30 pounds, she’s been the smaller one and my first has been the bigger one.   But a week ago we brought home Baby #3 and it happened all over again. I went to pick my second child up to sit her on my lap and read a book and she suddenly just felt so heavy and so large, and not like my little baby anymore.   I know it’s fueled by the post partum hormones and everything but it just made me so sad how my children are growing so fast and time just will not slow down. I’m grateful they’re still ages and sizes where I still  can  pick them up but it was a sudden harsh reminder that they won’t stay that way forever.",

My ex has been inconsistent throughout our child's life and I was basically left to raise our son by myself while he went travelling or moved to different locations throughout the UK and didn't see our son during that time even though realistically he could. He just kinda dipped in and out when he wanted to. Anyway, to cut a long story short there are some points that we don't agree on in this parenting plan that I need a bit of advice on.    Childmaintence. We have an existing case with childmaintence service. His current calculation is just over £40pm, he will have to pay a little more than that to work off arrears and charges he has accrued through non payment which totals to near to £6,000.  He would like me to cancel the arrears as he thinks this is unreasonable. Works out with what he has paid and the arrears he owes its around £13 per week over our sons lifetime.  He would like us to talk about coming up with a payment plan by ourselves but the only time he has ever paid is when childmaintence has taken payment directly from his wages and the last time we tried to talk about it he got angry and shouted at me in front of children so I'm very uncomfortable talking about it with him further.  Is this something that is reasonable for me to refuse to talk to him about and insist that everything be sorted through the childmaintence service?   Medical issues. I have stated that I will be the one making most of the medical decisions  but I will communicate with my ex about these. He thinks we should equally decide on medical issues. The reason I think I should be the one to be making most of the decisions is because I'm the parent who has taken our son to all appointments so far, I have also got the most knowledge of our sons medical history and therefore am better equipt to make these decisions. Additionally he is an anti vaxxer who has in the past given our son incorrect medical information regarding a procedure he was due to have. Our son was so scared following this information that he was unable to have the procedure so we have had issues regarding this in the past.  Is it reasonable for me to say it is ultimately me who will be making medical decisions on behalf of our son?  TIA.",

    "self_text": "There were so many kind words and wonderful ideas on how to get through this first Halloween while still making it special for my two surviving children, I'm not sure how to link the other post so but I just wanted to update. Halloween went well. My dear friend took them to some fun trunk or treats and they had a blast. They went trick or treating with my friends and didn't feel like it was lacking for my low key participation.  I did talk to them and their biggest worry was that these would be too sad and uncelebrated because their brother was gone and they didn't want to hurt him by doing fun things. So they felt so much more relieved and happy to change it up and go with friends instead of feeling like I abandoned them by not going with they took it as I was trusting them to behave and be independent enough to go without me, with the reassurance that I was right there waiting for them when they got home so they could show me what they got and tell me all about it. My youngest was especially excited to take on an older kid role since my friend's youngest is a toddler, so by being an example and helping him he felt extra special. I made sure they knew I loved them and wanted them to have the best time ever and luckily because we've gone on outings in the past with this family, they didn't find it unusual that I let them go without me. These friends are so precious to us and have been an active part of the healing process, so to them it just flowed that they would be there. Thank you all for your support and advice. Now onto the holiday season and working to give them that positivity and excitement they need right now.",

In addition to having a contract with the nanny, we have been advised to also have some basic agreement in place between the couples on how to manage the nanny-share.   We have verbal agreements on things such as pay, which house the kids and the nanny will be at and such. But we all agree that putting these down on paper will provide peace of mind to everyone involved and we can always adjust these things as we go.  Looking for pointers on either a template for nanny-share that other parents might have used or individual clauses that you think might be helpful based or your own caretaking experience 🙏",

They live a 12 hr flight away and are staying with family up the road, we planned to see them as much as possible this week, which would include my 4 year old and 8 week old. My niece has a typical daycare cold, same with my 4 y/o, so we had agreed to separate the kids as much as possible, which we are already doing at home. But my brother said he and his wife have mild cold symptoms as well. All testing negative for COVID.   I'm not sure what to do about the week. Is it delusional to go see them and keep the baby several feet away from adults, adults wear masks in same room as bb, and obviously no one else holds bb? I am struggling with the thought that we may have to avoid them all week, and hate keeping 4 stuck at home without being able to see family in a much anticipated visit. But it's so nasty out there right now and bb is just 8 weeks. I think I know the answer, just need to hear it out loud.",

    "self_text": "My son is 2.5 years old. I know toddlers throw tantrums and they're pretty good at it. Some of the more dramatic tantrums can be quite amusing.   My son is pretty stubborn, he's got a double dose from myself and his dad. He's fiercely independent which most of the time is a good thing but definitely has its drawbacks. My son has no middle ground, he goes from 0-100% in the blink of an eye over the most ridiculous things.   The part where me and my partner really struggle is my son's default to angry when he's hurt or unwell. We can't get near him or comfort him. Any attempts to be nice and understanding lead to lashing out and blindly running away.   Currently our son has a cold. He's not got a temperature, but he's full of snot and clearly congested with the way his eyes are watering. He's been waking up every 90 minutes absolutely screeching his head off but it's taking us so long to calm him down as he's throwing his blankets and kicking his legs in anger. He throws his comforter away. Talking nicely to him winds him up more, being more stern winds him up more. Touching him makes him hit out and winds him up more. Singing his favourite songs winds him up more. Acknowledging his feelings winds him up more. If we try to pick him up for a cuddle he fights he way out so hard he could definitely hurt himself. He is so strong for his age too. It's taking half an hour or more for him to stop angry screetching because he's feeling poorly and tired.   I feel like I can't even help my own son, both me and my partner have been sat in his bedroom with him trying all sorts of methods to help him calm but nothing is working. We. Can't even bring our toddler into our bed with us as he gets angry at sharing a quilt and if our bodies dare get in the way of him sleeping sideways he will kick out grumpily.  I'm scared if I don't find a way to calm him down so I can actually help that when he does really hurt himself we're not going to be able to help properly. We've had trips to the hospital before with breathing difficulties when bad coughs have caught up and he's taken that long to calm down it seems like the wheezing isn't easing off.   He's not a bad kid. He can be so empathetic, caring and polite. He's really good at changing his play and language to suit the level of the other kids he's playing with without prompting. His talking skills are beyond his age and 95% of the time he can make his point very clearly. His memory is better than mine and his understanding of situations is impressive, the questions he asks are always carefully thought out. When he's in the mood he can also be very understanding when the day's plan changes and I've been impressed with how he's handled disappointment before. He's remarkably adaptable and handles situations like vaccinations at the doctors, having a haircut or interacting with newborn babies like he was 10 years older.

    "self_text": "There are 7 people that live in my house, and 5 of them are women. I say this because women, at least the ones in my house, tend to wear like 3-4 outfits a day. TLDR; We have a lot of laundry. Especially towels, because god forbid anyone use the same one twice.  So my question is twofold:    Do you have any neat laundry storage system, whether it's a rack that holds baskets, or some gamified system that might incentivize children to put their laundry in a basket, or whatever. Just something other than a basket in a corner that helps you out when it comes time to do the laundry whether by making sorting easier, or just transportation.  What's your system for actually doing the laundry and putting it away?   For now, I've got like 7 of the Lamper XL's from walmart that are like 88 bushel capacity I think. I tend to dump all the dirty stuff in one MASSIVE pile and sort, so that as it comes out I can fold and put everything in a category away. One basket for each of the following:    my clothes  my wife's clothes  the girl's shirts  the girl's pants  my toddler's clothes  my infant's clothes  2 baskets of towels  and finally, just for ease of sorting, the girls socks and underwear   yes, yes, I know that's more than 7 baskets, I have a couple small ones for the younger kids, as their clothes don't take up that much room. I'm open to suggestions for improvement, and if you've got photos, I'd love to see them.  Also, can we please not do the thing where you start to coach me on how to get the kids to use one towel for a few days, or some thing I can do better as a parent to get them to listen when it comes to keeping things tidy? I'd love to just keep this about laundry tips if it's all the same to you guys.   Thanks so much for the tips in advance, I'm sure the moms here are full of them!",

    "self_text": "Desperately looking for advice or reassurance. My 19 mo girl recently developed a cold from day care which eventually turned into an ear infection. We didn’t know she had the ear infection until after two sleepless nights of screaming. She seemed perfectly normal during the day and assumed the first night was just a fluke. She woke up screaming so let her cry it out for about an hour on and off of screaming. During the second night of screaming we eventually went in after a bit and rocked her to sleep (I know this is where we went wrong likely but we were sleep deprived and desperate.) took her to the doctor and was prescribed amoxicillin.   We thought all would be good after getting some meds except now she associates the crib with pain/separation anxiety. Sometimes even going in her room just sets her off screaming.  Now we’re 4 days in and we can’t give her a bath without all out screaming because she knows bed time will come after and so on.   Now we have made a plan not to hold her but to pat/reassure/sing to her but if we leave before she falls asleep she starts screaming again. She won’t let herself fall asleep and will even resort to clinching onto the crib rail and fall asleep standing up. Waking herself up while falling and starting all over.   Shes been waking up one or two times in the night so my wife or I get up and sit with her til she falls asleep again.   I’m not sure how many nights I can take of this but worse off we can’t even give her a bath and can barely get her dressed and ready for bed without the fight. We looked into the Ferber method but again we can’t even get to that point at the moment.   Any advice would be appreciated",

My husband and I are both atheists and have to date raised our daughter (5) without any discussion about church, god etc. There is a large church around the corner from us and the other day she asked what it's for. I told her it's a church. Queue the questions:  -What's a church?  -It's where people who believe in God go to talk about him.  -What's God?  Having been raised Catholic, my first instinct was to get her a children's bible. But then I thought it would be great to get her a children's version of other religious texts as well, if that's a thing. But I also don't want to spend a fortune, and I realized a beginner's guide to world religions is really what I'm looking for. Something that explains the basics of what people believe in simple language and with pictures. A quick Google search brought up a bunch that seemed to be aimed at older kids.   Can anyone recommend one for younger kids? She's in kindergarten and can't read yet but loves books and we read together daily.",

This might be a contributing factor- we might indulge more in family time because they’re only here 1/2 of the time. And mom does the same thing from observations/calls from kids when they’re there.  I’m wondering how much 1:1 time you spend with your kids. Because I feel like unless they’re in front of tablets/screens (we have limits) the “Hey daddy! Hey OP!” Is CONSTANT. Almost to the point of not wanting to do anything fun without us. We do family slumber party every Friday night. I read to them for 30+ minutes every night. Of course we do their homework with them. Bath time. Family dinner. Play video games together. Go to the park, play soccer, take them swimming. That’s all normal. I’m wondering if it’s normal that every dull moment they want us to be actively involved in what they’re doing or to be RIGHT THERE while we’re getting something done.   Like 0% motivation to do something independently unless we tell them to. But it’s like they’re pacifying themselves until the next family event. We’ll ask them to find something to do and they have healthy independent activities, but it feels like we’re rejecting them even though we’re very hands on. It’s sweet and I’m grateful we’re all close but sometimes it seems borderline unhealthy. I want them to be able to have fun without feeling like they need us to facilitate that. I’m the oldest of 8 and remember all of us WANTING to play outside without the adults, or play without supervision. Especially knowing they turn around and go to their moms and are on 110% engagement mode also.. I wonder if our level of codependency is normal at their ages. Are we too cool 😂? I’m very close to my dad and had plenty of fun moments with him. But I remember him tapping out and we were like cool! Let’s go play with each other or the neighbor kids who match our energy level. I don’t have it in me to keep up with a 5 and 7 year old’s level of fun 100% of the time AND handle my responsibilities.

The nursery is basically right next to our bedroom. I really want the toddler moved out of the nursery so our newborn won’t wake her up in the middle of the night and ruin her sleep schedule- for the last few nights I’ve slept on the couch or tried to because our toddler shouldn’t have to be woken up every few hours. At first, my husband said he would do it before our newborn was born. Well it’s still not done and right before our newborn was born, he said we still have time and he isn’t getting our toddler’s room set up for a few weeks at least. I’m losing my patience because I’ve been sleeping on the couch- when I do try to have our newborn sleep in the bassinet he has been waking up our toddler at least once a night. I can’t do it. I’d rather sleep on the couch than risk our toddler not getting enough sleep or her not being able to go back to sleep. So my husband is now pissed because I’m sleeping on the couch- he wants me to sleep in our bed (no duh, I want that too) but I feel bad if our baby wakes up our toddler. Our toddler has adapted extremely well to our newborn and I don’t want her to be cranky during the day because of lack of sleep. I’m about to just work on her room myself because I don’t want a week old baby and toddler in the same room. I’m too paranoid our newborn is going to wake our toddler up to sleep well in there regardless. How do I even go about this without sounding like the AH? I told him beforehand that this wasn’t going to be a good idea. He thinks I haven’t given it a chance. The first night wasn’t too bad with them together but our baby still woke her up. Sleep is important to a toddler. I would sleep better if I knew our baby wasn’t going to wake up our toddler. Help! 😭😭😭",

It's a win win situation for everyone because my parents want to babysit plus we don't have to give up our jobs.

    "self_text": "So the title kind of says it all. In our building we have many amenties, I went to the club lounge/game room with my young two children, a man was working in the corner on his laptop. He got annoyed by my children playing in a room meant for playing/entertainment. I was sitting on a seat about 2metres from my kids.  He decided to directly shout across at literally a toddler and a primary school aged child. He was aggressive with his tone and so degrading to my kids. He scared them.  Before I lost it on him, I told him to never shout at my kids and to address me if he believes he has an issue. He then proceeds to says that he will do and say whatever he wants to my kids and asks me to show him what I'm going to do about it.  It takes a racial turn when he calls me (a black woman) \"uncivilised\" and tells me to go learn how to speak English & overall continues to mock my English. Which was so ironic because I was literally born here, but that's besides the point. The point is that it became evident that he was racially motivated.  I absolutely lost it at this point and started shouting at him to shut the f*** up and not speak to my kids again.  Keep in mind that the building we live in is huge, we have an entire business centre/library/meeting rooms which are specifically designated for QUIET work. And I never take my kids there. We only go to the game room from time to time after school. No one else was in there at the time besides us and that man.   I decided to call the building security number and as I'm explaining to them what's happening and they say they're coming to the room, he quickly packs his stuff and rushes out before they can get there.  They apologised and said they will do an investigation & that they don't condone this type of behaviour. There are cameras in the room that they're downloading the incident from.  They also said that we are well within our rights to play as much as we want in a room that's meant for entertainment and that if he was trying to do work he should have gone to the library in the building.   I will hear back from the building management after this weekend. But I'm absolutely fuming. The management encouraged me to file a police report but I don't know if that's suitable as there wasn't an assault.",

He thinks I'm overreacting and while he doesn't doubt I'd do a great job as a homeschool mom, he just thinks they can benefit more from going to public school with the rest of the kids in town.

Incredible program, great teaches, etc. However, after a few weeks from starting (started August 15) he began showing weird behaviors. He was fully potty trained. Then within weeks of stating began pooping in various areas of the house. (Dry bathtub, next to the toilet, in our kitchen sink, in an easel, etc)  He got in trouble for smacking a boys butt in the bathroom. Then told us they started it. Then that he was married to a girl at school and that girls mom would come to the bathroom with him. He also showed weird behaviors with his younger 2 year old brother at bath time.   We decided to keep him from his preschool to see if the behaviors stopped. It’s been 5 days and zero issues.   Left with, is this a phase? Was something happening at school?   Will be speaking with his principal this coming week to try to make sense of this. But looking for your thoughts.   Let me know if you have any questions. Just a dad trying to protect our son. But torn because the worst case scenario is so sickening. Or are we just over reacting to a phase.   Thanks all!",

Dad also works a blue-collar job and I am so proud of him for his physical labors. Dad has 3 children from am ex-marriage. We are not married but in a great relationship.   Our family is small, as I am estranged from my family in order to maintain a healthy mental well-being, so it is just us. Dad was adopted. His adoptive family was Caucasian, and he has several siblings (some bio, some not) of multiple ethnicities. His parents have passed away. I am of Western-European descents (Scottish and Polish), and he is of Latin descent (Puerto-Rican/Cuban). So, my son will be mixed-raced. Unfortunately, Dad does not identify much with his background, since he was raised by parents of a different race who didn't encourage connecting to his roots at all and were overtly racist towards him. I think he still applies some of those racially motivated comments from his father at himself and feels anger and shame.  I am unsure on how to educate my son about his ethnic backgrounds. Dad has some hostility towards other Hispanics, as his adoptive father was super racist and I see how that traumatized and discouraged him from connecting to his roots. It is quite sad to me that he never had the opportunity to appreciate a love/respect for his ancestorial background like my family provided. None of us know of any traditions or celebratory aspects of Puetro Rico or Cuba, while I do enjoy some Scottish and Polish traditions that I know my son will be exposed to.   This is obviously a conversation to include Dad in also, but he has a hard time with it. How do I talk about this with Dad without the conversation turning sour/respecting us boundaries? I don't want us to ignore half of my son's genetics. I don't want him to feel ashamed for not being a white man in America (I hate saying this, but as someone whose partner expresses these sentiments, I know it is a sadly valid feeling for many minorities). How do I foster a sense of pride in my son's backgrounds? I don't want him to have the same resentment he has towards his background like dad. This may not be politically correct to say, but I do not want to \"white wash\" my son and confuse or traumatized him. I want him to feel empowered and educated on his roots to improve his confidence and self-love.   Hopefully this didn't come across as insensitive or not PC in anyway, as I know these types of issues can be very divided. My goal is to just do the best thing I can as a mother. If anyone has challenges or differing opinions to my logic, I am all for hearing it to better parent my son. Just please be respectful if I am wrong in anyway. I try to be very open. I just want to learn and grow as a person/parent. Thank you in advanced for responses.",

I also have questions about things like medicine cups if they‘re taking the same medicine (i wash them in between) and also things like nose drops. Right now their nose drops are separate.   Is this ridiculous?",

This is so puzzling to me because I have always heard that babies do get a low grade fever while teething and runny nose and stuff.   I googled it (not to take that seriously of course but to just find other opinions) and it also states that it doesn’t cause fevers. I did however find a few websites for parents that said it does.   I’m just wondering how many other parents have heard that teething will cause fevers and any experiences y’all have had with your kids and teething.",

For those of you in similar set-up, I’d love some advice on how you did baby gates with the stairs:   When did you put them in? Did you do it before or wait till babies got more mobile? Wife is saying maybe we can wait a bit.   One at top and one at bottom?   Our stairs are wall on one side, post across - what gates worked well in this set up? Post is round, so drilling directly into it won’t be a flat surface. Is there better gates made for stairs I just haven’t found? The idea of drilling into these posts (house is brand new, only been in 6m) makes me cringe but I know safety is more important. What did you do? What worked well?   Any thing I haven’t thought of? Has anyone with stairs not done gates?   Thanks all!",

If you’re a parent and you feel increasingly isolated from how you would love to be right now and your hobbies and friends because life is just a little crazy and hard right now - I’m sending you compassionate thoughts and, eventually, the little ones will grow up and be more independent and it’ll all get a little easier.   If you’re a parent and today was just one of those days where you couldn’t meet anyones expectations, I’m hoping you’ll be kind and generous with yourself and be proud that you did what you could do with what you have.. anyone who matters should and will understand eventually.   If you’re on parental leave and work is coming up and you have no clue how you’ll manage it all , we’ll figure it out as we go along. This will be the new normal for a while. Itll be different and hard , and painful to be away from the little one , but if it is necessary , then it is necessary , even if it isn’t a financial question, it might still be necessary and that’s ok.   If you’re a stay at home parent and the dishes are piling up and the laundry is a mess and the food on the table isn’t nutritionist approved , give yourself a warm hug and a smile in the mirror, everyday is a 24 hour work day for you and you take rest where you can and you prioritize what you want.  If you’re paying more than should be fair for daycare and somehow the little one is always sick at home and work isn’t understanding when you have no other choice but to be there for your child , maybe some day basic social needs will be met fairly and flexibly for all families.. in the meantime I’m wishing you patience and immunity that gets stronger and stronger every day.  If you have no idea what you are doing most of the time, and you are exhausted all of the time just know there’s a giant club of people just like you and we all recognize the value of the work you are putting in , and the tremendous power of the love you are providing even when you are simply brushing your lips on your child’s forehead to test for a fever or cutting a fruit just right for your baby.   🤍",

I've been encouraging my other half to get out, have a few drinks and spend the night at a friends as she won't be able to drive home. This means  I have a 2 year old boy all to myself for the first time for 36 hours coming up soon.  The thing is, he's always been a very troubled sleeper though and is very reliant on Mum being around, so I'm expecting a bit of a troublesome night when he inevitably wakes up - he's only ever slept through a handful of times, which is fine, I'm not looking for advice on how to get him to sleep through, trust me, we've tried pretty much everything that we are comfortable with as parents.  I was hoping that some of you might have a few tips or tricks so I can try prepare him for the fact he'll wake up and mum won't be there and also some for when he does actually wake up. Historically every time she's gone out it's been local, so she's always come home before he woke up so it was just a \"oh look, mum's home now\" kind of affair.   My gut feeling is remind him whenever he notices mum isn't around to reassure him mum will be back *tomorrow* after nursery, and that I'm here for him the whole night no matter what.   Thanks!",

First, the obligatory I love my kid more than anything in the world statement which is 10000% true.  So my sweet 3.5 is in general a happy, great kid. He's definitely still 3 and acts that way, but for the most part he's a joy and pretty easy to parent.  Then we brought his sister home. At first, we were so pleasantly surprised - he is so affectionate and loving and just obsessed with her. He loves to play with her, help with her bottle, she's the first thing he thinks about every morning and the last thing he thinks about before he goes to sleep.   After my husband went back to work after 6 weeks off, we had a period of adjustment and our big kid did pretty well. But now baby is 11 weeks and my toddler is just getting worse by the day. Peeing in his floor after being potty trained for a year and a half, throwing things/hitting (only his dad and me, he's not ever rough with baby), and today we had to pack up and leave after 20 minutes at a local kids area because he was throwing things. Typically when we are out and about he's an ANGEL and he saves all his wildin for home. Not today, today he chose violence. I had no idea what to do (it felt like we had literally just gotten there) so I just said, \"alright, fun's over! Time to clean and leave.\" So we did.  I KNOW that this is all developmentally normal and my toddler is not the only 3.5 year old who has hurled a lego. I KNOW that this is due to the adjustment of having a new baby sister who needs mom and dad. I know these things logically but I'm giving all I've got to give and it's obviously not enough and we're all suffering.  We don't spank and we try to be very intentional with our parenting. We gentle parent, but not to the extent of permissiveness. We definitely have boundaries and hold them. We have a daily schedule/routine. We do a lot of feelings/Emotional development at home. I have worked so hard developing a secure attachment with both kids. What the fuck else can I do to help out both of my kids and get us all out of this transitional phase with our bonds intact?! Has anyone else had a kid get way worse as time went on after bringing home a baby? When does it get better?",

She’s a sweet, bubbly child and a wonderful big sister.   For as long as I’ve known her (3 years), she is shy at first upon meeting anyone, children or adults, but warms up quickly and turns into a little ham. That’s just always been her personality.   Yesterday being Halloween, like any other kid, she could not wait to get out and go trick or treating once she was home from school. She starts out full of enthusiasm. But the second we walk up to any house, she suddenly acts like she’s afraid, looks down at the ground, sheepishly holds out her Halloween bag and doesn’t say a word to the person giving her candy…for example, a sweet old lady was giving her candy, complimenting her costume, and she’s dead silent with her head looking down and I have tell her to say thank you until she finally mumbles it…  Is this typical kid behavior that she’s likely to grow out of? I just want to instill manners in her without being too pushy or making her feel uncomfortable. I’m not saying I want her to people-please strangers or anything like that. At home she’s usually pretty good with saying please and thank you. I just want her to be polite to cute little old ladies and feel a little more confident!",

I saw a review on one I really liked saying that it wasn't level which cause their baby to roll right into the side...which led me to think of my bedroom floor.  It's on a slant, just enough that a ball will roll if you place it on the ground without steadying it.  Would a sturdy bassinet or crib be okay even if it's on a slightly tilted surface so long as it doesn't budge?  Or am I looking at some kind of special baby physics issue?  I'll be a first time parent so I really don't know what to expect from a sleeping baby, I just know that safe sleep is on their back and I want to make sure they stay safe.  I'm probably going to have to get something small to sleep on in my office since it's level and keep baby in there, but I'd rather sleep in the comfy bed my fiancee and I just finished paying off 🤣 it's a two bedroom apt so space is limited and our bedroom is the largest room so most ideal to have us and baby in until baby is old enough to be in the office-then-converted-into-nursery but obviously can't if safety is an issue.  We are also actively working on getting out of here into a nicer, larger home but I'm trying to be prepared for the possiblity that we might be stuck here for a year or (really really hoping not) two.  I was hoping maybe someone here had experience with a similar issue that could give me some relief?  Or maybe know of a model bassinet that might be adjustable to the floor? My fiancee says I overthink but this has been really bothering me.  It's hard to find the bassinet and crib to suit our needs without knowing where it's going.",

    "self_text": "My babe is in kindergarten this year. I’m having a very hard time following their rules. My daughter is doing great socially and academically. But her attendance is already too high by their standards. A meeting with the school board is inevitable. But I know I have done what is best for my child. Both short term and long term. I’m responding to her needs and as a mother I don’t know how to force her to follow policies that harm her physical and emotional health. If I push her to go when she needs a break, our lives are miserable and it results in her getting sick. It’s sort of like kids actually know their bodies better than adults do. I feel like I’m gaslighting her because she’s right every time. She does need a break. I realize that this is the way things are. But she’s been home for the last two years. It’s not realistic to shove her into a rigid routine and expect her to thrive right away. I’m trying to transition her in a way that will teach her the ways of this world. And help her figure out how she can function within it. I’m not trying to keep her from school. I’m to guide her towards it. It’s the schools one size fits all policy that is creating barriers for her. And idk how to shut up and follow orders where my child is concerned. Any and all commentary is welcome! Thank youuu",

I’d like to relocate to be closer to my mother because she has cancer. I also have little support where we are now and I need some major surgical procedures on my knees.  When I asked my husband he said maybe we could move back to where my mother is but he’d like to stop to go to a specialty school. And I asked when he’d like to do this and where and why he hadn’t mentioned it before. He said his father had mentioned it and it sounded like a good idea.  He said “or we could do it when she’s older”. I mentioned I didn’t want to relocate her during primary school years as I see my older nephew struggling as everyone around him has friends that they’re connected to cause they went to middle school together and he didn’t.  He essentially said she’s going to have an easier life than either of us ever did and she could deal with it. I know moving happens all the time for kids but my concern was with his argument of “she isn’t going to experience abuse like us so it isn’t a big deal if she struggles in a move”  I could be dramatic,it seems dramatic now that I write it up.",

I just want to know from some of you all of this is a common situation and how I can approach it in a fun/gentle way because I feel like I’m losing the plot. My son has a sensory processing disorder heavily food texture related, and since he has began going to therapy some of the things we had stability with have regressed, such as meal times. Kiddo has food fixations where he only wants specific things for a meal and if the meals aren’t safe foods, he would rather starve than eat them if he is made to take a bite he will gag. Lately he is shrinking his list of safe foods and falling to bare basics of meals, and I’m worried the lack of variety will start causing issues with growth and development. Examples of current safe foods are spaghetti, plain turkey sandwiches, peas, and pizza. Things he has regressed away from are peanut butter sandwiches, pop tarts, granola bars, generally veggies in all varieties. He does eat a pretty balanced diet where I hide things within the meals so he gets what he needs but the options are pretty limited in what I can get him to even try anymore. Textures are a big problem and liquid based things are the biggest battle like soups, whipped cream, and milkshakes. Does anyone have any ideas or experiences where they were able to disguise foods in a way that wasn’t noticeable to a finicky kiddo, while we allow therapy to work through the root of the issue? I have talked to his pedi about the lack of a balanced diet and there wasn’t a ton of concern for the moment he is well over his age height and weight range but i am still a worried parent.",

Or shopping for gifts, for me, my kids, my husband, anyone. My children do not want for much in this world. And it makes it insanely hard to build a wish list for them. I'm scouring gift guides and thinking it's either:   Going to make a mess.  They already have it or something like it or have had it in the past.  It's too expensive. I can't ask people to buy that.  They'll play with it once and forget it.   I'm left with like, no options to put on their wish lists. And since it's hard to find things to put on their wish lists, it leaves my husband and I with limited options for Santa gifts barring big stuff but we've done away with that recently. We usually stick to the thing like \"something to read, something to make, something to wear, etc.\" But since my husband and I are shying away from buying huge Santa gifts anymore, we're almost always shown up by family, who may or may not follow the wish list. My mom certainly doesn't.  Anyway. Thank you for coming to my TEDTalk. :)",

She talks to them, enforces some type of punishment for one day, then acts like all is well and good and doesn’t follow through. Yesterday was the breaking point for me, when I found our bath towels in the bathroom, with feces on it. The younger one, wiped his hands that were covered in feces (for some unknown reason) on clean towels, and just left it there. Like nothing was wrong. I’m tired of waiting for my fiancé to get results, so I’m going to step in to get it changed. My question and problem is what kind of punishment or discipline should I try to get things changing in a better direction?   *a side note, the kids fathers are not in the picture And they aren’t used to having a male figure in their life *   Any feedback would be appreciated.",

Last week I chatted with this English Teacher and we were brainstorming what can be done to allow him to be more focused in class. She had mentioned he's often on his phone and refuses to participate  due to that. She also said that when she suggested he leave his phone on her desk at the beginning of the class that did not work and he would use take it anyway. This teacher has been very supportive of him and we asked her what we can do to help. She suggested we keep the phone home while he's at school as he has too much difficulty not using it in class. We said ok we can do that.   He was really not happy about this and starts telling us we are abusing him basically because that's his social lifeline and what if there is an emergency etc. Well I did some googling and it seems that people disagree with taking away phone as teens heavily rely on them for social support and it can make them depressed. I am not restricting it all the time, literally only at school. But now I am worried I made the wrong choice.   Did I make the wrong decision, any suggestions if I did?",

The girl's (9+7) dad is my mom's best friend's son. My mom calls her best friend sister and I call her aunt and call most of my aunts kids my cousins and their kids my nieces and nephews even though there is no blood relation. The girl's dad is no longer in their life and doesn't associate with any other family member. So, the only way we see the girls is through their mom. Unfortunately, their mom has some issues that has caused no one else in the family to want to communicate with her besides my mom and I, but this has made it so the only way for them to see their by blood aunts/uncles/cousins is through us bringing them over for visits and trips. (My aunt also talks to her, but she lives states away from all of us)  Well, their mom has a very different parenting style than I do (no offense to anyone) She lets her girls wear crop tops, makeup, booty shorts (out in public) and they both have their own iPhone with no restrictions, so they are on snapchat, facebook, etc. So when our girls play together my daughter will start asking me why I can't buy her a bra or she will start tying her shirts back to show her stomach or ask why she can't have a phone. I let her know she needs to enjoy her childhood and not worry about that stuff right now. She never gives me attitude about it and just says \"Okay mom\".  But they have been teaching her some more inappropriate things I won't go into detail, but basically showing her videos online little kids shouldn't be watching (I talked to their mom about this and she didn't care) This resulted in my daughter having her iPad being confiscated.  I don't really feel comfortable with my daughter hanging out with them anymore and I feel really guilty for multiple reasons. I love the girls and have since they were born. I don't want to be super controlling of my daughter's friends and have her resent me. I don't want any drama with their mom. Also without my mom and I they will not see their aunts/uncles/cousins because they have burned bridges with the girl's mom.  Well my mom knows everything that is going on and still wants to take them places with us and to visit their cousins I told her I'm starting to become uncomfortable with my daughter hanging out with them and fear it will get worse as they get older, but she insists everything will be okay.  I am looking for any advice, outsider opinion or ideas about how to handle this. If you think I am overreacting, please let me know. I just want to do what is best for my daughter. Thank you guys.",

We have never been this low in life. We honestly both get touched out very easily and after two or three consecutive hugs we can't handle them anymore. Today, we couldnt get enough hugs. I never truly realized how much a hug from a child can help when you feel like you're at rock bottom.   She can be very intuitive and may know something is wrong but doesnt know what it is. But the fact that kids dont usually have to worry about things like what we worry about makes me wish i was a child again. It makes me happy to know that she can be happy even if shit sucks because she just doesnt realize how cruel the adult world is. I know as she gets older that will change, but I hope at the very least she continues to be a ray of hope and happiness because this world needs it.",

We kept the girls separated and all wore masks inside, hoping to avoid contact with our newborn.   Three days ago we noticed our newborn starting to sniffle a little bit - not panicked yet, started propping her up in her Basinet and using a cool mist humidifier.   Over the next two days - Symptoms gradually turned into fully stuffed nose and a cough here and there. Nights were the worst, she’d fuss anytime her nose was a little stuffy as we did our best to suck the boogs out with saline & the nose freida.   Middle of the night last night, she was having the toughest time yet. Coughing more frequently, rapid heavy breathing (more than 60 breaths/minute), nose flare, completely stuffed beyond control. We decided to go to the ER at 3am. (Fortunately our 4yo also had recovered by this point and is staying with her grandma so we can care for littlest one).  We were well aware of RSV and hoping it wasn’t that - but a rapid test confirmed once we got here.   They immediately helped with her stuffed nose using their mega-nose-freida. We’ll be staying here the next couple days to continue monitoring, but feeling optimist that we came at the right time. So far no fever, oxygen levels are normal, she’s just having a really tough uncomfortable time.   Sharing this in case anyone is worrying about RSV or seeing similar symptoms in their children. It’s very scary to see our 3wk old struggling this much so early on….but you can be vigilant, and help is out there. We were kind of “should we go?” Before ultimately going to the ER today, and very glad we did.   Be safe out there everyone 🤍",

He does this weird thing also where he’ll be on his hands and knees but then stick his left leg out perfectly straight and then wonders why he’s not getting anywhere. He ends up sitting up when he does this??  Any tips folks?",

    "self_text": "What do you do with your kids on the weekend?  I have shared custody of two boys, ages 9 and 11 and lately I feel like we should be doing more to take advantage of our time together, especially on weekends.  They both have music lessons and martial arts during the week so occasionally we have belt tests or recitals on weekends, but it’s rare. I’m also involved in community service so occasionally I’ll take them with me to volunteer if the work is age appropriate and I think they’d benefit.   I tried to get them involved in scouts and sports but have been unsuccessful because their mom is unwilling to drive them to activities during her time with them (it’s an argument I no longer engage in). Quite frankly, the local scout troop is also poorly run, so I’m not sure how long we would have stayed with it anyway.   They’re no longer interested in playing with toys and they’re becoming less interested in Lego, despite having a ton of them and having recently invested in some Lego mindstorms. They will occasionally draw or play tabletop games (chess, go, board games, Pokémon, etc). They may also spend time watching YouTube and playing video games (console and iPad) or making music in GarageBand.   We have movie night on Fridays and I occasionally wrestle with them or engage in brief nerf battles. I also try to have them help me cook or do DIY tasks around the house but they usually wander off, generally uninterested in using power tools (I’m shocked too!) or doing anything to help that takes more than a minute or two.   Now that winter is here, we can’t go outside as easily or often to go hiking or play football, basketball, and other things outside. What am I missing as a way to keep them away from screens on the weekend?",

Someone from my side of the family always decides to buy my daughter the biggest toys. This birthday, he got her a massive indoor hanging tent. We do not have nearly enough room for anything else. On the opposite end of the spectrum, my husband's parents bought our daughter a huge Barbie camper, filled with little tiny objects for the dolls (utensils, cups, etc.) Not only does our 3 year old still put things in her mouth (and now nose,) but we've spent the last 2 days pulling these little toys out of our cats' mouths. We're also concerned for when we have a second child and trying to keep these items away from a baby. On top of that, I honestly don't like the message that the Barbie brand gives in general and I'm fully expecting them to give her Barbies for every holiday now, just like they did for their other granddaughters.   I'm not sure how to handle this. I told my family member to please hold off on any larger toys for now because we don't have enough room, and he sounded...not offended, but let down, saying \"I guess the tent was a really bad idea then...\" Obviously I especially don't want to step on any of my in laws toes.  So, how do you approach this subject? I tried making wish lists for my daughter that were more full of experiences and they were completely ignored by family. These people have been to our house many times, have seen how little room we have, the toys we choose to buy her, and just how many toys she has already. I'm not seeing this problem getting any easier in the future without some sort of intervention.  Please give me all of your ideas.",

    "title": "Spicy 6 year old - All Advice Welcome",
    "self_text": "There's so much missing context unless I write a book, but I'll try to keep it short while including key details.   I have two kids, a 3 yo boy and a 6 yo girl. The boy has a great disposition, funny charming and a monstrosity of a mess-maker.  Our 6 year old daughter is extremely defiant. When she gets home from school, she sometimes has no problem doing homework. Sometimes though, it's a massive problem. She literally tears apart homework, then makes us make photocopies of it after 90 minutes of coaxing. She frequently bargains - initially she says she will not do homework, then after 20 minutes of tantrums, will do it ONLY if she can use an orange pencil and we make a photocopy of the homework she destroyed.  If she's tired or hasn't eaten with regularity, the problem is exacerbated. One night, she didn't like that her mom dried her off from the shower, so she fucking climbed up into the bathroom sink to wet herself again with the faucet. Then she ran naked to her room, and absolutely melted down for another half hour. She would put underwear on only after I put them on for her, which I refused. Then she wanted me to get off her bed so I could make it again. At this point I stopped talking to her, stopped making eye contact. For 15-20 minutes, she slapped me, pulled my hair, pulled my jacket, knocked my phone out of my hand, etc. until she tired herself out and cried herself to sleep in her bed. We don't tolerate hitting and have never hit the kids.   Episodes like this are almost a daily occurrence, and it's putting incredible strain on the family. I'm very strict, and my wife is very permissive. Initially I thought this was because my wife was too permissive, but this feels like a level beyond and it's sort of victim blaming.  The very weird thing to me is - if my daughter is nasty to us, I will call her out on how much it affects our family. I am short and blunt with her when she has tantrums, and kind and interested when she is of the same mind. My wife will just try to distract, move past the sticking points. Despite my wife being clearly kinder and more nurturing, she has formed some strange terrible resentment towards her. She calls her stupid, tells her to shut up, she hates her, etc. She refuses to let my wife drive her to events, and only I can drive her. It doesn't make sense - my wife is so much kinder to her (when she's having fits), yet she has expressed a very clear preference for me, many many times.  There are moments of clarity where she's happy and writes \"sorry notes\" to her mom, but being around her since she started 1st grade has been like carrying around a loaded gun with a random hidden trigger. When she is tired and hungry things get much worse, but she refuses to admit hunger or fatigue, almost like she sees these things as weaknesses, and people aren't allowed to see or acknowledge she has vulnerabilities.   My wife is a therapist - she regularly works with child clients, and I consider myself a very good communicator. We try to talk her through intense feelings, but she never does. Never. Ever. She immediately puts up a wall and refuses to take it down until we talk about  anything  else besides her feelings. We are very open, introspective people and she is a rock.   Ive researched like crazy and the closest,  unprofessional  possible diagnosis I can cone up with is Oppositional Defiant Disorder. There's a lot of stigma around it - over diagnosed, or it's just code for \"you're actually shitty at parenting.\" But boy oh boy, a  lot  of the symptoms line up. For the record, I just started a new FT job and just got the kids on my insurance. We were looking up qualified therapists in the area. Now that they're firmly on the insurance we'll pick the search back up.   Any advice is welcome. We're miserable, I don't like being around her lately, and I'm so worried for her future.",

    "self_text": "So we recently graduated on the 29th of July with a beautiful baby girl!!  The first 1.5 months she was a dream to feed and would take both the bottle and breastfeeding but, I had to go back to work so she wasn't getting many bottles anymore.   I went to feed her one weekend and she didn't want the bottle at all. She would spit it out, gag on it close her mouth and this would go on until she was red in the face, hysterically crying.  I had to drive a fair way away from home last weekend just to feed the baby because mum was at a wedding.   We have tried:  -New bottles and bottle tits with a range of different flows  -Waiting for her to be hungry like giving it as her first feed of the day  -Tricking her with the boob first then sneaking the bottle in  -Various different positions and feeding locations  -Formula and breastmilk  -Different temperatures  -Even tried holding the mothers clothing hoping her smell would help  All of these attempts were unsuccessful and we are desperate for any tips.  I would love to sort this issue out ASAP so my partner can have more freedom and so I can take care of my daughter by myself when I need to.  Thanks in advance Regards, LC",

    "self_text": "I want to keep this short but with kids in the 3-5 range, how do you get them to do the things they need to do (like getting ready for school, eating dinner, taking a bath, going to bed, etc.) without threatening them, physically doing it, or bribing them?   I feel like it’s doing them a disservice to be constantly threatening (4 year old has started to use threats against us or siblings. It’s kind of cute at this stage but don’t want her to think it’s okay behavior). I feel like bribing teaches them to only do things for prizes or treats rather than because it’s their responsibility, which we want to teach them about. And physically doing it for them or yelling goes against what we want to teach them about how to act. My daughter is quick to yell at her siblings - we constantly tell her it’s not okay to talk like that so I’d be a hypocrite if I raised my voice aggressively in order to get them to do something. It makes me feel terrible when I tell them to lay down in bed and try to go to sleep or else I can’t lie down with them for a few min. Parents love is supposed to be unconditional and I don’t want my kids thinking we only love them when they behave. I just don’t know how else to get them to do stuff.",

IMO my son and I have a good relationship, my son and I have had the embarrassing conversations that most dad's handle...bc my husband is gone at work 90% of the time. My hubs is tired when he is home and sleeps/naps most of the time. We are quiet when he's home until hubs wakes up. It's our norm.   I had a conversation(one of many) with my husband the  other day about how I feel like he needs to spend more time with his son. That i feel like it's normal for a dad to say come on (insert kids name) let's go do blah, lets go see blah, let's go...etc. That if he wants a relationship with his son not just now but later in life he's going to have to put in effort. My hubs says they have a relationship. (I disagree)  My hubs dad also worked 90% of the time but when he was home he was forced to go with his dad......if him and his dad had plans usually someone would randomly show up at the house and the dad would bail on their plans...honestly I put blame here.....he had....and still has a bad relationship with his dad.  Tomorrow my hubs has plans to go spend time with a friend....hubs is currently at work so I texted him....this is a copy paste of our conversation   ME: Are you planning on taking  boy  with you tomorrow?  HIM: I hadn't planned on it didn't think he would want to  I'm seeing RED but haven't responded...this has been an on going conversation over the years and a recent this week conversation.

    "self_text": "My youngest (6yo) is very sensitive. She's struggled with mental health, is probably ADHD/ASD(siblings are diagnosed). She just got started with a therapist  today  to look for the root of her struggles, which are very complicated and, ultimately, not the main point of the post. My husband is a loud man, and tends to be the \"strict\" parent, I think due to anxiety and how he was brought up by a very strict/emotionally volatile father. My husband is not aggressive or mean like his dad, just literally loud, as in has trouble moderating volume of a regular speaking voice. He has an appointment for an ADHD evaluation and we think that's why he's loud(our son with bad ADHD has the same volume issue). He also can get a bit over the top with lectures imo, he doesn't just address an issue and drop it/give a consequence. He keeps on talking past what I feel is reasonable sometimes.   He and my youngest butt heads a lot. She's very impulsive and disruptive and in the past has had major behavior issues, which have improved a lot. She's also very stubborn, rigid, emotional, and sensory seeking(always moving and talking/screeching at home but silent at school). But she's sweet and brilliant and a good kid overall. She tries. I see her trying. Sometimes she just can't help it.  We trade off bedtime duties. Which by this age is just us tucking them in, playing a song of their choice, saying goodnight. During this time the kids can still be a bit rowdy. Talking through songs, flipping around on beds, riling each other up. And by that point in the day my brain is fried. I fully admit I get snappy, am not in a great mood. I just want them to lie down and sleep. I frequently leave the room feeling kinda bad and vowing to do better the next time. But my youngest always begs for me to do songs. Begs! Tonight she was almost in tears asking for me to do songs instead. I asked why(away from my husband).  She said he's mean during songs. I asked how. She said she can't explain. I asked if I could talk to him about it, she said no, she doesn't want me to. I said I would remind him to be calm, without telling what she said, I would read a story with her before, and it would be ok. She calmed down but then right before bed she again begged me to do the songs. I took my husband aside and told him vaguely that she is very sensitive today after therapy and can he please be very gentle with her. He said he would. I trust that he took that into account. He isn't an old school guy who doesn't believe in mental health. He understands kids who are ND, he knows she needs extra support. I just don't know how much of this is her being extra sensitive, and how much of it is him being too loud/kinda strict and needing to tone it down. I also don't know if I should keep this conversation between her and I, like she wants, and try to help him with the issue and not directly say what she told me. Or should I tell him upfront what she said and work on it with him, and risk her feeling betrayed that I told? I know he will be open to fixing the issue, I just don't know how to start. I also know regardless we should start family therapy.  Edit: The kids all share a room. The elder 2 kids(9f and 7m) haven't said anything of the sort. And eldest also tends to be pretty sensitive, but has said nothing about bedtime.",

We put the kids on the bus (boy, I'm glad we did!), and we drove to the school shortly after, expecting some tables to be set up outside the school, as it was noted to be an outdoor event. We thought we'd be eating breakfast with our kids - and all of the other parents who showed up seemed to have the same expectation.   No, they had muffins and a packet of reading tips for parents, with nothing for the kids. Quite a few parents came with their kids, and the person behind the serving table kept repeating that the food was for parents only. But it's Donuts  with  Dad & Muffins  with  Mom.  They thanked parents for coming to the event \"Donuts with Dad & Muffins with Mom - Reading Tips,\" said this was a great turnout, make sure you get your reading tips for parents, and that was it.   I'm fuming! I hate disappointing my kids.   Update: I dropped off a letter to the principal this afternoon. I tried to be nice and follow some of the advice here. I pointed out the parents' expectations and the resulting confusion and disappointment for both kids and parents.   I suggested that if they want parents to be engaged at the school, they should plan engaging events. This had the potential to be one, but it was poorly thought out. I suggested that meeting parents where we are (i.e. inviting us to come read to the kids or invite us into the school) and treating us as partners in education will improve engagement. My background is in education, and I have offered to come help, but have received no response from the principal.  After school, we got donuts! My son had been disappointed that we didn't eat breakfast together, but he was able to have a good day at school. I messaged his teacher that morning to let her know we would be getting donuts, and she said there had been a lot of disappointed kids. When I asked my daughter what she thought, she told me she had been busy at school. She seemed to think I was silly for thinking that I would be able to eat breakfast with her. Lol. Feeling very relieved that we were able to smooth things over with them. I hope the other families were able to have positive solutions as well, and I hope to hear back from the principal.

    "self_text": "My daughter is just under a year old and I’m seriously considering changing her name.  I’m not going to include her real name here because it’s a very uncommon name (nothing with creative spelling or anything, just a very old German name). And I’m worried my husband might see this. We’ve discussed my worries about her name but asking the internet is another thing.   The problem is that we simply never, ever use her real name. Literally from birth we called her a nickname derived from her real name. (Think “Gwen” for Guinevere). No family members use her real name. We have friends that probably don’t even know her name. Her real name feels awkward when we say it. It feels formal and slightly alien.   Also, 9/10 people mispronounce it. I can’t believe I didn’t see this coming. The pronunciation seems obvious to me but obviously it isn’t. We kept the name a secret until she was born but I wish we hadn’t because then I would have known most people don’t say it the way we expect.   I chose the name. My husband happily agreed to it and says he likes it but again, he doesn’t ever use it. Just the nickname. I initially loved the name but now it feels like a clunky, embarrassing misstep. Every time we introduce her by her nickname it feels like acknowledging I messed up and gave her a name that didn’t “take.”   The worst, most stupid, most embarrassing part is that I myself, her mother, am like…not totally sure how I want to pronounce it 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ when I force myself to use her full name, I sometimes randomly hesitate and say it differently. Since she was born I’ve also come across different ways to pronounce it and it’s as if my brain can’t decide how to do it anymore.   I just want to stop here and note that you cannot possibly be rolling your eyes at me harder that I’ve rolled them at myself. I know not being 100% sure how to pronounce your own child’s name is next-level stupid.   I don’t want her to grow up feeling estranged from her own first name because no one ever calls her that. But I also feel like it would be bizarre to change her name at this point? It would feel like catering to other people’s convenience, in a way, and it’s not like we have zero attachment to her real name. It is the name we chose for our baby girl, after all.   If we did change it, I’d want to change it to something very similar so she’d still be able to go by her current nickname. I just also want to not feel weird and awkward about my own kid’s real name, you know?   She currently responds to her nickname but we can’t really tell if she knows her real name. She’s not talking yet.  How crazy and terrible is this?",

Fast forward to the present day, and my daughter woke up sick.  I decided she needed to be seen so I called the pediatrician's office this morning.  It's a long hold time so I was given the option of a callback when I was next in line to speak with someone.  20 minutes later they call and I'm next in line, great!  10 minutes later I finally get to speak with someone, explain my story,  and they tell me that they have to have the triage nurse call me back, which she does 30 minutes later.  She listens to my story again and she says she'll have to send a message to the doctor's office for them to call me back.  Two hours later, no one has called so I call back and this time they patch me to the nurse in the doctor's office.  I tell my story a third time and she says \"well we don't have any appointments today but I think our other office has an opening.  I'll send them a message and they'll call you.\"  An hour later the same nurse calls me again, \"oh they don't actually have any openings so if you think she needs to be seen, you should take her to urgent care.\"  Meanwhile, urgent care is a 2 1/2 hour wait and I have to get my other kids off the bus  in less than 2 hours so it's going to have to wait until after that.  Gee, if I had known at 8am when I first called this was going to be the case, I could have taken her right away and this would have been done by now.  What the hell happened to keeping appointments for same-day sick calls?  &#x200B;  Edit:  So, daughter and I headed for the urgent care as soon as my other child got home from school, around 3:30pm.  When we got there we were informed that it would be about 3 1/2 hours.  We spent 2 hours in the waiting room and then another 45 minutes in the car when my husband brought us supper because we were starving.  We walked out 20 minutes later with a prescription sent to the pharmacy.  Drove straight there to get it, but they apparently closed at 7, so her treatment got delayed by a day.  Basically, my entire evening was sucked up waiting to be seen for 20 minutes.",

When they started dating was the low point between her and my relationship (due to another ironically similar situation), which I believe was the trigger to her finding love in all the wrong places.   When they started dating, he was 16 and in 9th grade. He had failed a year so he was in her grade. He still missed school most days because he didn't feel like going. My daughter moved on to 10th grade, and said he was doing virtual school. That lie continued for 6 months (although we as parents knew better) until he finally admitted that he dropped out. For an entire year he had no school or work, and just stayed home playing video games. Our daughter threatened to break up with him if he didn't get a job by May, so lo and behold he started a job on April 29. So they were still together.  Throughout the course of their relationship, she never met his family. He got angry if she talked to other guys, or watched certain shows, or fell asleep while on the phone with him. He eventually refused to be around us, and he started to drive a wedge between her and us. She would come back from her dates very terse and would do everything she could to avoid seeing us.  We could see all the red flags flying, but we knew we couldn't force her to break up with him without it turning into a secret relationship. We treated him with nothing but respect when we were with him. We had talks with our daughter every chance we got to subtly bring up our concerns without angering her. As we approached the two year mark, I was really concerned that I could do nothing to prevent her from moving in with an abuser. He was now 18 and spending most of his paycheck buying gifts for her. She constantly talked about moving in with him when she graduated high school.  But yesterday, she came back to us. She realized she wasn't happy and broke up with him. And he turned full on abusive in response so her eyes are wide open. He's threatened suicide multiple times over the past few days unless she comes back, but thankfully she recognizes the abuse for what it is, and all her friends and her sister have her back.   I wish she never had to go through this, but I'm secretly rejoicing to have my daughter back. Yesterday, she was laughing and smiling with us for the first time in what feels like forever. She told me today it's the most normal she's felt in a long time, and she loved our time together. My husband is out with her now, since she normally went with her bf on Sundays and needed a distraction. We're both remaining subdued in order to support her, so I came on here to just rave about having back the girl we know and love. WE'RE FINALLY FREE <3",

Any of you out there with healthy emotional development and  relationships, if you could give me advice on how I should handle when she feels upset, angry, or  frustrated and expresses that I’m being rude and what is actually disrespectful versus Healthy expression? Anytime my children express themselves my gut tells me that that are being rude and dramatic so I have to carefully think on what’s being said before determining it was not okay. I’m aware that this is result of my childhood so now when I’ve concluded a behavior was not okay I’m constantly wondering if what she is saying is fine and maybe it’s something I don’t realize yet I N was just told it was disrespectful?  Tl;dr: parents taught me blind obiedience; I can’t gauge  when kid’s disrespectful. What is truly disrespectful, and how do I approach it + child’s big feelings?",

My spouse typically makes good money and I stay home with the kids since our youngest is 1.5 and our 5 year old is Autistic. So appropriate child care and getting to/from appointments would cost more than I can earn.   Problem is, my spouse lost his job a few months ago and money is getting a bit tight to say the least. We earned more than the income limit before the job loss, but income now is only ~2k per month or less from side jobs.   Would we have to go a full year before qualifying? I don't expect things to drag on that long but i wasn't really expecting this, so I'm just grasping at straws a bit. I'm not really sure how all this works.",

It can turn into a full on meltdown, throwing himself to the floor, kicking, screaming.  It’s gotten significantly worse since he’s been sick for the past 5 days but it’s scaring me that he’s going to stay like this.  Any thoughts, advice, solidarity?  Thanks!",

Sometimes wide awake for an hour or so.   Give some context she goes to bed around 7 (can’t keep her awake later) then wakes through the night and finally up around 6am (sometimes a tad earlier). During the day she naps hour and half in morning and about 30 mins in afternoon.  I took her to the drs and she said she is healthy and honestly not too concerned because she is so happy. I have looked at all environmental factors and she is comfortable. No lights, perfect temp and everything.   When she wakes she wants to be held, fed or changed. I will do all 3 but then up again 2 hrs later. Last night Only slept 3 hrs because of this.   She is an extremely active baby which I do love but idk what is causing this. She just got her first tooth popping out and the second is coming in. A little fussy but not really. She stands and trying to walk. Could these milestones be the issue for the last 3 months and going onward?  Any suggestions I appreciate it. Thanks in advance",

    "title": "\"Santa must exist because I know that elf is real\"",
    "self_text": "This is a clusterfuck of cringe. Ths is an unprecedent situation I wasn't ready for. My boy turned 6. We decided to take him to Hamley's (huge dreamlike toy store in London) so he can see when they open the gates which is a while thing .. he rung the bell.. all the magic. Everything was Christmas themed, of course, and they usually have staff showing toys and dancing at the door to invite more people inside. These staff members were dressed as Santa's elves this time. We were one of the few first to get into the store, so there wasn't  that  much action yet; but straight away one of the elves offered my son to write a letter to Santa. It was the full thing: this was a real elf and it was going to deliver my son's letter to Santa Claus at the end of the day. So the setup was there already: North pole and all that is real.  We shop, we laugh, my son gets tired after only one hour of being there because he's six and we also travelled to London which is quite the journey. We are all tired. When leaving the store, Christmas music is busting and all the elves were dancing.  We  start dancing. And it just happens that one of the elves was a little person. My son froze on the spot, HUGE smile on his face, hypnotised. \"She is so short! Why?\". It was his first time seeing a little person. I kneel to his level and say \"Some people are born shorter than others\". He starts dancing again, I get excited as well since everyone is aaaahhh happiness joy yay! And the elf in question proceeds to do her job and say hi to my boy, ask his name... high five to him and we leave the premises.   It was pouring. We wait under the little roof while we think what bus to take. And my cutie boy looks at me, and says \"Mum... is Santa real?\". His father looks at me laughing and says \"You take care of that\". Again, I kneel and ask my boy \"What do you think? Do you think he's real?\". And he says \"I think he's real, because that elf there looks real to me. I think that is a real elf.\" - Then I tried my best to explain, that there are a lot of people born that way, the same we are all born with different hair color, skin colour, height etc. That someone is short it doesn't make them elves... but if he thinks that elf is real, then ok, all those elves in the store are real.  We start walking and he keeps asking me if she was a real elf. And in my stupidity, or lack of creativity... or I just thought it was a good idea that second, I blurted \"why don't we ask her and all the other elves with her if they're real\". We did that. The elves very professionaly said \"of course, why do you think we're dressed like this?\". We leave, I turned around to make an apologetic gesture... and then I saw the \"fuck my life\" look in her face.. I regretted being born.  At bedtime my son kept talking about the elf, and why he knows is a real elf. And I just showed him pictures of l all the different little persons in the world, and kept talking about how we are all different in one way or another and Santa doesn't have anything to do with it. Sigh.  In any case. My boy's mind was blown on his birthday. I know that I just witnessed what is going to be one of those childhood experiences you share in embarrassment when you grow up.  And I'm still not sure if I deserve hell for how I handled the situation or not. And that's the worst part.  How would you have handle this? I know there's smarter people out there, and I need to be ready for the next time.  EDIT: One day later it comes to me that I could've said: \"Elves are too busy working in the North Pole right now. These are human Santa helpers, they help by bringing the Christmas spirit to the city.\"",

My immediate family consists of my parents, my two adult sisters, and my husband’s father. Aside from my mother, the other adults are horrible to buy for. They don’t like anything they don’t immediately buy themselves, so it’s impossible to buy thoughtful presents for them. We’re not close, so we basically buy each other gift cards and it feels very forced and fake.   What I would love to do is basically stop doing gifts for adults, but if they want to buy for my child, that’s fine (I know my mom and husband’s father want to do that and would not accept being told not to). However, how do I suggest that since it might come off like my family is the only one getting anything? If my sisters had kids, I’d 100% buy for them, but they don’t and don’t intend to.   Is there any way to approach this that doesn’t come off greedy or insensitive? Or should I just leave it alone and keep buying and receiving obligatory  presents? Thanks :)  Edit: I’m fine if they don’t want to buy gifts for my kid; 100% not trying to come off like that (that’s the point of this post!) If the best option is just saying “please don’t buy me gifts” and I keep buying them gift cards out of societal obligation, that’s fine with me. Id love to buy them gifts they’d appreciate, but I’ve spent 30 years trying to no avail 😅",

I on the other hand don’t feel the need to correct and I just change the subject and move on because I know when the mood strikes nothing will change his mind, in that moment. I told my husband to try to change the subject and move on, but it’s very difficult for him to do that— he feels like he wants to give advice/guidance but is not being listened to. It’s almost like he gets triggered in these situations. Any suggestions on what’s to do?   Adding in a cranky 2 year old and a 8 month old puppy… it’s getting intense! Thanks!",

    "self_text": "My kids are 4 and 7. They have plenty of toys in their rooms and tons in the basement. Now my husband works from home in the basement, no separate room with a door so admittedly they can't go down there during work hours. But I work 3-4 days a week too so most days they're not home during work hours. When I do have a weekday off my 7 year old only has a half hour between getting home from school before my husband finishes work, and he usually plays a bit on the switch when he first gets home.  My four year old is in half day preschool 3 days a week and most of my weekdays off match up to those days. So say I let her watch as little tv then we get groceries and have lunch before preschool, there isn't much time to get bored of the top two floors.  My husband thinks I'm crazy for not wanting to store toys in the living room. He doesn't even think we should get a coffee table because they won't have space to play. He thinks they deserve to have toys throughout the house because it's a family home. I don't even mean they can't play in the living room but when they're done the toys just don't belong there.   His only argument that makes sense (to me) is that the basement and kids rooms are both so full already there wouldn't be space for the stuff currently kept in the living room. Which is true. Of course that's another issue, he's much more sentimental about what to keep them I am so we have so many things they hardly play with but because they have pulled them out once or twice in the last six months, or if they're a particularly sentimental gift, we have to keep them.  But am I a terrible parent for not wanting the entire home so kid- centric?",

I love my child, I love both of my children equally, but I find myself feeling very resentful that I was dealt this hand. Parenting him has been challenging from the beginning. He never slept as an infant, causing me to be so hallucinated  and sleep deprived it physically harmed my health. Autistic/ADHD combo children often have difficulty sleeping, and even now at 4 his sleep is very restless and he wakes up at the smallest sound. I rarely get a break even at night because I have to tiptoe around the house for fear of waking him. He goes to preschool part time and his teachers are good, but also I get complaints nearly every day that he’s not listening, not keeping his hands to himself, refusing to participate, pick up, or generally do anything they ask him to. He screams and meltdowns at literally anything. Breaks everything. I have holes in my walls, furniture is chipped, stained, broken, etc. because of his meltdowns. I can’t take him anywhere like a store for more than 15 min. because he runs off or screams. Won’t hold my hand or ride in the cart, he melts down at that too. I can’t do anything “normal” with him. He won’t read a book with me. He won’t color or play with me. I largely just leave him alone or else he fights with me. He screams at me constantly. He sees a psychologist and an occupational therapist. To be honest, I don’t see how it’s helping anything. He’s too young to be medicated with anything. He is still very much like a baby in some aspects, poops in his pants, drinks from a sippy cup, but has the verbal and physical skills to reign terror and tell you he hates you and wants you to “go away”. I just feel very resentful. I love him so much but I do not enjoy his company. When he’s at school and it’s just my 2 year old and I, we bond, play, talk, laugh. I can’t do any of that with my 4 year old. I feel trapped and burdened with his care sometimes. My husband is almost always at work, sometimes gone for days, months, etc. (military), and I’m here being basically tormented by this child. I look away from him for 5 seconds and he’s climbed on top of the fridge and is throwing down glass bowls and laughing. He frequently harms his brother too, pulls his arms and hits him if he “interrupts” his focus, and is cognitively incapable of understanding that he’s being harmful. I just… I don’t know what to do anymore. I am so bitter this is my child.",

    "self_text": "I (30 F) am the legal guardian of my 14-year old sister who I will call *Lacey. Several years ago there was some legal/health issues happening with my mom and stepfather (Lacy’s father) and I was granted guardianship.  Lacy had been a surprise baby and our mom and her father really had no interest in parenting which is why I took over the reins for a while.  After our mom separated from Lacy’s father,  Lacy moved back in with our mom and they moved in with our grandma & Another relative who is addicted to substances. It’s supposed to be temporary until they can afford to move out. And I live 15 minutes away from them and I visit Lacy every other weekend now and we are very close. Now that they are divorced, it’s worse than ever.  Our moms been going through a midlife crisis and some trauma from her marriage and changed up her entire life.  She went back to college, got a cool, new job, and she’s been traveling the world with her girlfriend of 2 years.  Unfortunately, Lacy has been left behind with all of this.  Moms living her best life, her dad only sees her once every 2 months, and they are living with our grandmother who goes to sleep at 5pm.  In the last 3 weeks, I’ve found Lacy drunk, high, or out of it all alone in the home.   And a few nights ago she confided in me that she brought a random boy over and “got lost in the heat of the moment” and begged me to take her to the clinic to get checked out. She didn’t even know the kids full name. When I asked her why she said “Why not? Not like I’ll be married or have a boyfriend anytime soon. Better to get it over with.” Then she got lost in explaining this story of being a single teen mom & having a mini version of her that will always love her.   After talking to her for hours, it sounds like she’s been super lonely. She told me mom is never home anymore except Sundays. Her dad rarely checks in on her. And due to my own work schedule and college and relationship, I only see her every other weekend.  All of our siblings have moved out and moved on with their own families so she’s been on her own raising herself for a while now.  I’m taking her to the clinic anyway but her blasé attitude towards what happened deeply concerns me.  Lacy has had a long history of depression and self-harm and has been in out of therapy for a while.  When I’ve spoken to our mom about some of her issues she rolls her eyes and says “It’s just for attention. Just talk to her will you?” And then will disappear to the Bahamas with her friends.  I don’t want to betray Lacy’s trust but I also feel nothing will really change if I do.  Our moms never been a hands on mother, even when I was a kid.  My brother and I raised each other.   When it comes to Lacy, mom is quick to call me and will demand I “handle it” and I always do.  But I’m genuinely lost here.   Do I tell our mom? Do I fight back to have her live with me again?  Any advice?",

    "self_text": "My husband’s sixteen year old daughter, K, recently moved in with my family at the beginning of the year. Both her and my husband are from a central Asian country, and she just moved here from that country to attend school in the US, because her mother unfortunately passed away. I’ve been with my husband for five years and I’ve only met her twice. I’m happy to have her with us.  I also have a daughter, M, who’s the same age, who’s lived with us the entire time we’ve been married. She and I are both American.  K and M went into their third year of high school at the beginning of the year. It’s been an adjustment, especially for K, who had some culture shock, but I’m happy to say she’s adjusted very well.   There’s a boy in their class that I will call B. My daughter M has had a crush on him since the end of last school year, and they are part of the same friend group, so they saw each other over the summer.   We live in a diverse area, so B is actually from a neighboring country to where K is from. K is fluent in that country’s language, and her and B immediately hit it off after M introduced them. I had asked M to introduce K to some of her friends if she wanted to because I thought it would ease the transition into American school.   The problems started in the end of September, when B asked K out. M was heartbroken, and mad when she found out K had accepted. They had a fight where M told K it was rude she agreed to go out with her crush, and K said she didn’t know M liked B, and it was too late.  Ever since then, it’s been horrible. K and B are still dating. She tries to avoid bringing him to our house if she knows M is home. They’re a nice couple, and spend a lot of time together studying, but it’s clear that M is hurting. She’s made several comments to me about how mad she is that K is even here in the first place, that she should just go back to her country, and that she’s a horrible person.   M won’t talk to K at all. I don’t know what to do. I thought about trying to suggest to K that they should break up for the sake of our family, but my husband said that was inappropriate for me to ask. I don’t know the full story, so I don’t know whether or not K actually knew that M liked B, though I don’t believe she agreed to go out with him just to spite M. I did ask her why she agreed to go out with him, and she said that she appreciated finding someone from her culture, and he was nice, they have similar career paths, etc.  It’s been so tense in our house. I don’t know how to fix this, but M can barely stand to be in the same room as K. It’s made our house practically unlivable.",

Even though I was more symptomatic than him, I'm still the parent so I still fix meals, get cups of water, medicine, cool wet wash cloths, anything that he needed.  About midweek I realized, at his age, this might very well be the last time that I'm able to care for him like this.  To comfort him like when he was younger.  When he wasn't \"too old\" for me to do so.  My gift, was realizing this before the moment passed.  How many time have we told ourselves \"If I'd known that was the last time that I'd - seen my grandmother/hugged my dad/talked to my friend - I would have taken care to make that memory last\"  So the last half of the week I've been banking memories.  Checking in on him \"too often\".  Running my fingers through his hair.  Rubbing his back.  The sorts of things I may never have a chance to do again.  I've tried to remember with detail all the little things I've done for him this week.  Who knows, he may get sick again.  In which case I'll bank more memories to add to these.  But the important thing, to me, is this.  I caught it before the chance passed.  There's a million little thing a parent does as a labor of love.  We may sigh and huff, but we do it because these little humans are ours in our hearts.  But there will be a last time that we will have the opportunity to do many of them.  Try not to miss it.  Just had this rolling around in my head and wanted to get it out.  Thank you for reading.",

My wife typically goes to be around 8 or 9. Wakes up at sometime between 5-6 am naturally and our son wakes up at 7. This has worked out well for us.  I'm typically up till 1 or 2 AM doing school work (sometimes even later, like tonight I got a call at 2 AM I have to be on). Our doors inside the house can't be locked. Our son has learned how to open the doors and his favorite thing is  to open the door, run into our bedroom and wake me up.  Our current solution is we place a heavy vase in front of the door when its shut so he can't open it but that's not ideal.  But I'm wondering if anyone has suggestions how to get our toddler to let me sleep? My wife does her best, but it is what it is.",

    "self_text": "So for some background information, my sister lost custody of her child when he was 7 years old because after she split up with his dad could never stay clean from the hard drugs and was allowing dangerous people around him so his dad ended up getting full custody, since then he's been cut off completely from my side of the family. Just today, my sister received a visit from the police because my nephew has ran away from home and has been missing for a little over 24 hours, nobody knows where he is but a note was found where he explained that his father choke slammed him to the ground and he wasn't coming back. This breaks my heart more than anything because him and I are 7 years apart so he was more like my little brother than a nephew to me until he was ripped away. Once the police find him, he won't be going back to his father's for obvious reasons and his mother won't be gaining custody of him either so the only 2 options are that my other sister who has 2 teenage girls takes him in, or myself (21F single mom with a 14 month old son), if none of us do it then he'll be going to foster care. Technically speaking, I have the room for him and it wouldn't be too hard to buy groceries and whatnot for one more person, im just scared because he's not the little boy I remember, he's now a teenager with raging hormones, im doubting my capability of providing him with the love and emotional support that comes so naturally with my son, im also not sure how much he would respect myself and my son, (what if he doesn't follow my rules? What if he steals my personal belongings though if I do go through with this I would lock up my alcohol and weed which is legal in Canada and I never smoke inside so haters back off!)  I really need advice on this one, as someone who was in the system I wouldn't be able to sleep at night having a loved one in there not knowing what kind of abuse they're being put through",

I’d like to get him a floor bed but I’d like the option of laying in it to read to him and whatnot before bed….. I see all these fancy Montessori floor beds that just look like a crib mattress or twin mattress with a low wood gate around it. That’s cute and all but….  I’m considering just putting a full mattress on the floor so I can lay with him? If he roles it’ll be so close to the ground it won’t be a big deal.   Is this not a thing? What considerations am I overlooking? Can I just put a full on the floor and call it a day?  Will of course “wander” proof the room too once we follow through!   Thanks very much!",

    "title": "Failing as a parent to a toddler",
    "self_text": "Hi. I'm a mom to a 2.75year old and a 1 year old.  I'm not sure where else to go. I'm too ashamed to talk about this with my parents and none of my close friends have kids.  I had a vision of how I'd be as a mom, how my parenting style would be, how it would mold my kids into well mannered children who liked to be engaged.  But that's not what's happening. My 1 year old is no problem because he's 1.   My 2.75 year old is a different story. I did all the research. I made sure to be as consistent as I could with ignoring her tantrums and praising her good behavior. I don't scream. Since she's gotten a little older if she is being aggressive with her brother she'll get a 2 minute separation, etc. I set hard boundaries.   But all day, it feels like. Every hour, sometimes less - she is whining. She is crying. She is upset. About every LITTLE thing. I try to name her feelings when she's exceptionally worked up. I try to get her to breath and calm down. It only escalates her. I will try to ignore her when she's having a moderate tantrum. It only escalates her. She is always demanding. I refuse to give into demands unless she calms down and asks politely but instead she just melts down further when she doesn't get what she is demanding.  She hits her brother. She growls at us. She screams at the top of her lungs. Sometimes for no reason. When we leave places like parks she has a complete meltdown. She'll scream an ear piercing scream at the top of her lungs the whole ride home.  I tried enrolling her in a toddler gymnastics class..she did great for the first class. Okay for the second..and had a complete meltdown today. I'm so embarrassed. There are 4 other girls her age there who have no issues what so ever. I'm going to un-enroll her now. She doesn't appear to be ready for any sort of structured classes.  She isn't potty trained. Sometimes she wants to use the potty. Other times she doesn't. What she doesn't want either way is to wear her pull up..she takes it off every opportunity she gets and whines when she has it on..she eventually just pees somewhere on our carpet when we try to give her the opportunity to potty train.  I keep thinking she has autism or some sort of behavioral disorder. The thing is she can be very articulate when she wants to be. She is also very sweet. She can be extremely engaged when she wants to be. She is great when everything is on her terms. But I won't allow that to be a \"thing.\" So instead she is eternally frustrated and melting down. I feel like every day I'm living with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  The other day I did lose it on her. We were leaving a park and she didn't want to. She was arching her back and wouldn't let me put her in her car seat so I screamed at her at the top of my lungs. It felt good at the time. It felt like every frustration  was leaving me. But I felt terrible immediately after at the look of fear on her face and how she started crying. It wasn't her throwing a fit cry. She was scared. I did apologize to her after. I told her I shouldn't have screamed at her but when I say it's time to go it's time to go and it's not okay to scream and throw a fit.   Maybe I'm doing it wrong. Maybe I need to scream at her when she's being bad. Maybe I need to punish her more severely. I remember my dad yelling at lot when I was younger. But to this day I don't like raised male voices. My husband has agreed on a no yelling unless absolutely necessary policy but his temper is shorter than mine and he has lost it on her a bit more frequently than me (but not frequently if that makes sense.) and when he has I can feel myself beginning to panic. I freeze up. I feel all around uncomfortable and upset. I guess I just don't want her to feel that way.  But maybe I need to.  I've spent the last hour crying alone in my bedroom..my husband and I got into an argument. Normally we're a team but we are trying not to take our frustration out on her so today we took it out on each other.   We live on the opposite side of the country from family so we have no real help. She's in daycare 2x a week and we have a nanny come 2 mornings a week with her son. Literally never any complaints about her. I see pictures they daycare posts and the nanny sends me. She's always smiling and happy and engaging in some activity.  Anyway. I guess this is mostly just a rant/vent. I hope this is an okay place to post this.  I'm thinking about seeing her ped about her but this feels more like a \"me\" problem than a her problem. Like I'm just a bad mom. And that makes me so so so so incredibly sad. I just want my kids to be healthy adjusted adults. I want to do what's best for them.   Does this get any better? I'm absolutely terrified of my 1 year old getting older now. I don't think I can do this again. I'm not sure I even have the patience for another round of this since I'm not sure this round with my daughter will ever end.",

    "self_text": "I don't know where to post this, but I'm bursting with pride this morning.   10 years ago, my son was in college, and called me to let me know he was joining the Navy. I supported his decision, but had to ask why. His answer was, \"to help protect people\", which was in my mind, the perfect answer.  Fast fwd, he gets married, ranks up pretty fast, and is part of naval intelligence.  Fast fwd more and he leaves the navy, and goes through the police academy, hoping to get hired on in the county his wife is from. He gets hired as a deputy sherif in September.  So I'm visiting him this week, and a good old North Dakota blizzard hits. 12 to 18 inches of snow lands on the ground, with our usual high winds. White out conditions, with -20F windchill. The call comes. 2 cars are stranded out in the country, one has an elderly lady, with 1/4 tank of gas.  His wife is very nervous, and he is too. His patrol vehicle isn't great in the deep snow, so a coworker rounds up a 4x4 pickup. She has never been in this stuff, so he decides to be the driver.   I'm giving him tips, and saying things like, \"at least it's night time, so your lights will create shadows in the ditches, so just stay between the shadows. (During the day, it's just a blinding white, and you can't tell where the road is, other than by feel)  I hand him my extreme cold boots, he puts them on, and I walk him outside to meet the pickup. I then sat in my vehicle and waited for 2 hrs... finally we got a text from his coworker, that they were close to town.   The elderly lady was in the ditch, barely dressed for 40F, much less -20F. She was crying when he pried opened the door to help her get out of her car. She was sure they wouldn't get to her.   Last night he saved his first life, and I know deep down inside that it's the reason he chose his path. Not all cops are dicks, some just want to protect life.  [Edit] The reason this is such a big deal to me, is because I'm old and feel like I never contributed much to society. I have lots of regrets. He is the one good thing that I helped bring into the world, and even though I only got to be with him every other weekend, I tried to raise him to be a good man, with mottos like, \"do what you know in your heart is the right thing, even when people tell you it's wrong\"",

He has PLENTY of toys and things to play with which he does but he gets antsy. I loved taking him to the park and for walks. I still try but it’s getting cold for him. Even having him help me with yard work seems to be less fun for him in the cold as opposed to the summer no matter how bundled. He definitely starts to get cabin fever and act up when he’s inside too long.   What do some of you do all winter. Do you have any out of the house actives you like to do with your little ones during these months?? Or indoor things as well??",

The daycare, the pediatrician, and the internet all say the same thing that it's normal for this age and to just tell her no biting that it hurts then redirect her to another activity. Lately, she hardly ever seems to bite me any more but it's almost a daily occurrence still that she at least tries to bite other kids at daycare. Sometimes it's random, sometimes it's because another kid has something she wants. Now it's to the point where daycare is saying that if she bites one more time, she's going to get unenrolled until she can move into the 18mon-2y class at the end of the year because the other parents are upset. They've had me pick her up a few times now after bites including 3 in the last 2 weeks. Their policy mentions that next escalation would be to send her home for a few days and then for 2 weeks but they never did that. I called a couple other daycares today and they don't have openings for that age until next year. I get that I wouldn't want my kid to get bit either but they're never seriously hurt and I don't think there is anything else I can do. Any tips on addressing the biting, talking the school out of kicking her out, and/or finding quick alternate child care is appreciated.",

He is safe he is clothed he is fed he is clean and he has everything he could ever want. And for the most part he is a happy loving child. When he was baby I was so good. I did everything by the book. Breastfed for almost the entire first year. Even raised him on a super healthy plant based diet. I was calm. I was patient. I was purposeful. Once he got around 3 years old is when things started to change. I always sort of knew, Even when I was a kid that there was this some sort of uncontrollable darkness inside of me. I would see other parents with their kids and think to myself “I’ll never be able to do that.” in reference to being selfless and kind. I held this darkness in for so long and would even get upset with my husband for showing an ounce of what I was feeling inside towards our child. When he turned around 3, I noticed myself being just careless. Not in an unsafe way but in a “I want to be a gentle parent but I can’t do it anymore” type of way. My dad died when I was little and I was raised just by my mom. She was a good mom, I very rarely got spanked I could probably count on my fingers the amount of times she did that. She’s so kind and thoughtful and sweet and we had and continue to have a great relationship. Yes we would argue when I was a teenager and there were times where there was lots of yelling. But I always saw her as weak/pure and knew she didn’t have the darkness that I had. Fast forward to him being 6, almost 7 now. I have a sort of parental rage that most people wouldn’t even believe could come from me.  I try so so hard every single day to control it and be gentle and kind THATS WHAT I WANT! I always wanted to be a gentle parent I wanted to break the generational curses and change things with my family. But it’s gotten to the point where I’m going to lose my family or myself if things don’t change. I feel like I need to be medicated to just be a normal person and that makes me so sad I feel pathetic. I shouldn’t have to take medicine to be nice to my child. I love him so much and only want the best for him and I know when I’m doing this that I am ruining him!!!! I yell I cuss I throw things I let my Emotions control me and I know I have to be so scary ): I can feel myself getting there and try to stop but it’s like it takes over and I can’t control anything until it’s over and I can come back and deal with the after math and the guilt. I need help. Has anyone found relief from rage without medication?? I feel like the more that I desperately try to grasp onto normalcy the more I slip away into this evil monster of a mother that I don’t want to be. This is all so hard for me to say and I want whoever is reading this to know how guilty I feel every single day and that I want to change. He will never forgive me and I will never forgive myself if this is the person that I continue to be. Someone please help me.",

First, I need it to be a travel system. I need a car seat I can use from day one. I don't want adapters- I want it to click in easy. I want it to come with the car piece as well so I don't have to purchase separately.  I want the toddler seat to convert to a bassinet. I don't want a separate bassinet and toddler seat (I don't have much storage in my house)    For the wheels, I really really stuck (no pun intended). I really need all terrain that I can take on our trail dirt and gravel trails. I don't run so it's not a jogger per se, but I do like some of those features. I think I do want rubber air filled tires (although if it's not super heavy, foam filled seems okay) I really want good manoeuvrability and for the wheels not to get jammed. Good suspension for easier pushing on these trails, would be so nice too.  I'm not very strong so it's important to me it folds very compact (one arm fold would be awesome) and is self standing after folding.  I would love a parent tray and toddler tray if possible (especially if a higher price point, I believe it should be included).  Handle bars that extend upwards would be great (my husband is 6'8 so it would be great if he didn't have to reach).    It would also be nice for it to have good reviews and rating- give me peace of mind. Also,  full long warranty (not required but nice).  Thank you so much for your help and suggestions. I'm starting to really feel overwhelmed and hopeless.  Cheers!",

She has left her job to care for her high-needs child and is therefore financially compromised. Can anyone point me to local resources for her? For example, she cannot get a cpap because they need to schedule her for a titration and no one can  watch her children.

He wants our constant attention, and won’t engage with anything on his own.  Food is a constant battle, he’s so incredibly picky and will go hungry instead of eating (which leads to some great moods). He has all sorts of sensory issues which trigger him (the most recent doctor we saw suggested autism screening).

    "self_text": "I have an 8 year old son that when my wife and I asked if he wanted to go for a sleep over by grandma & grandpas house he said no. This was unusual since he loves grandpa since he will play all sorts of games with him, inside, outside, sports, board games, toys and everything else. So when we asked why not at first he wouldn't tell us so we let it go hoping come later that day maybe he would open up to us more. When it became night time we asked again and after a little bit he opened up to us about the problem he was having. My sons issue was when they weren't doing some organized type game and say just sitting, grandpa (my dad) would tease him by poking him and just being his silly self per se. It was never anything that hurt my son physically from what my son tells us but the issue is when my son would say stop it or no grandpa would keep doing it. So he would tell grandma that grandpa wont stop and she would just ignore it or say something along the line of no he isn't. My son did everything right that we have told him. We have always told him that if someone touches you to tell them no/stop and to get to a trusted adult and tell them. So we have always told  him that its his body his rights when it comes to touching ( then also told him its the same if someone else say no, that it needs to be respected). My wife and I were very proud of him for telling us this info and made sure to tell him that as well as that he was not in trouble and would never be for telling us something like this. We find out he didn't want to tell us because he loves grandpa and did what to hurt his feelings. Also that what he might have liked when he was younger (6 years old) he doesn't  like now (his words). So yeah, I'm so proud of my son for telling us all this makes me think that I might possibly be doing an ok job.  Now the kicker. I reach out to grandpa to tell him that my son loves him so much and loves playing with him BUT he doesn't like him teasing him/poking him and especially when he says stop and how it continues. How that he loves him so much and didn't want to hurt grandpas feelings that he originally didn't want to tell us what was going on. I told grandpa what he likes now he probably wont enjoy when he is 12, or when he is 12 he wont enjoy the same things when he is 18. I tell grandpa if he could just respect his boundaries that would be awesome. Well out comes full on anger and deflect mode from both grandparents, \"I'm not going to be reprimanded for my actions by a 8 year old i'm a grown man\", \"what about the time he did listen to me when I told him something\", etc, etc. Full on anger and deflection towards my son for what I thought was a simple and logical request. By the end of it and me trying process what just happened they say that we should just cut ties and not talk anymore. So that was interesting. So the question/issue I have now is how to handle this with my son. He does love them both and I feel like no matter how I tell him my son will have some level of guilt thinking that this is his fault which it 100% is not. I don't want them to lose the relationship they have and I plan on continue to reach out to them ( sending photos of the kids, asking about holiday plans) even though they made it clear they were done. I also don't know if I want to continue with them because if they had such a strong reaction and say we are able to walk it back a bit, will my son be treated to same as before or will there be some underlying issue around what happened that could resurface and end up doing different/ more damage to my sons wellbeing. I just cant believe instead of trying to grow as a person and learn from issues their go to was to deflect and attack what an 8 year old child has told us. I guess this question really is  about parenting my son and now my parents too.",

He's that kid that wasn't invited to other kids houses.  But he's also sensitive, has empathy and loves hard.  He started a new highschool and has gotten involved in a group of boys that make shitty choices.  I knew my son smoked weed, we live in a low socio-economic area, I didn't want him bonging on down at the park so we said he could do it outside at home.  Now his behaviour has gotten completely out of control.  He stole his father's motorbike at 14, was chased by police for 12kms then stopped. They just told him not to do it again.  Today I've found out he's selling at school, vaping, wagging, fighting, stealing.  I'm absolutely devastated. We've tried absolutely everything. Therapy for years, medication, CBT. Special schools and programs.  The police are already involved with another matter for him and we have a meeting with the youth liaison officer next week.  What do I do? How do I help him see that he'll either end up on jail or dead?  I'm absolutely desperate",

Within the last 2 weeks, little guy has been saying “I don’t want to go (to Costco, to the library, etc.)” refusing to even get dressed now or even play outside. We’ve tried bribing with fun things, special treats, literally anything and he instantly starts crying and saying no. If we have something we absolutely have to go do, he will fight getting in the car, most the car ride and then be fine for a good chunk but ALWAYS begs to go back home and be all done. Same with outside. He used to play outside for hours on end and now when we convince him to go outside, it’s maybe 15 minutes and he’s ready to go back in.  Is this just a phase? I’m going stir crazy and obviously love spending my days with him at home. But sometimes we have stuff we need to do & other times I just really need a change of scenery.",

My wife had our daughter 2 months pre-mature, meaning her actual age is 5 months old, but her corrected age is 3 months old. At first we hadn't a worry in the world, she spent the first 29 days of her life in the NICU but solely for observation, as there were no issues or cause for concern. We got home with her mid-June and for the first 3 months she slept constantly. Never cried, never screamed, always sleeping. It was wonderful.  Now, over the past 2-3 months, both my wife's and my personal hygiene has decreased, we have almost no time to clean the house, I have no time to complete my work-from-home tasks, and our relationship with each other is taking a hit. Our daughter will usually wake up once to feed at night between 7pm and 7am. Once she's up at 7am we follow a 1h30m to 2h wake window, she usually takes about 4oz in that time, and begins getting sleepy around the 1hr30m mark. The problem is not getting her to sleep, but  keeping  her asleep. After 1h30m awake it can sometime be 2 more hours before she's asleep in her crib. We will rock her to sleep in our arms, but as soon as we make any sort of movement in the direction of the crib it's game over. Even getting her into her crib successfully usually will end in her flailing one or both of her arms or legs and startling herself awake.  We have tried everything under the sun from a noise machine, anti colic drops, Tylenol, swaddling arms in, swaddling arms out, softer crib sheet, different formula, black out curtains, no curtains, lullaby's, children's songs, classical music, shorter wake windows, longer wake windows, it seems like we've tried everything!

My son was easy from birth until recently when a combination of teething & formula introduction has made him wake up crying a couple of times at night- something he rarely did as a newborn. I’m a sahm and my partner wfh. I take care of our son all day and at night. My partners sole responsibility is to change poopy diapers, which most of the time he complains about. Ever since our baby’s sleep pattern changed, I’ve been getting 2-3 hours of sleep which I don’t mind bc it’s temporary. Letting him cry it out isn’t comfortable for me because it stresses me out & will only take sleep away from baby and I (mostly me). I’m Asian and my partner is American. It’s normal in my culture to cosleep until baby walks. We don’t let babies cry, we teach comfort first before independence.  Now my partner and his parents are telling me I comfort him too much and co-sleeping has spoiled him. I didn’t mind the baby being fussy because I know it’ll past but their comments are stressing me out to the point that I’m crying all the time. They’re pressuring me to start bed training (something I was already planning) but they don’t realize how much stress it’s taking on me. I barely eat and I’m tired. I feel like I’m being forced to raise our son based on their rules and expectations when my partner only financially provides but barely puts the effort to raise our son. How do I deal with this? also if anyone has any tips on transitioning from co-sleeping to crib, i appreciate it (I’m learning about it first before starting)  Update: I see a lot of comments about costing my in-laws their sleep. This house is almost 6k sqft. When I ask if they can hear them sleeping, they say no because the rooms are literally soundproof. Our rooms are also on opposite side. You have to cross this long hallway to get to theirs. Their comment on sleep training is solely based off the fast that it’s not normal to co-sleep.",

It might not even need to be a video game, maybe there is a cool electronic/interactive toy?",

This therapist has reported me in the past when she mistook something my daughter said ( a friend of hers threw a book at another friend and the therapist thought I threw the book at my daughter). I started searching for a new therapist for my daughter after that, but my daughter protested and said she really likes her therapist so I just let that go.   Yesterday she had a rough day and messaged her therapist. Her therapist thought she was suicidal and called me to formulate a safety plan. I was happy to cooperate, however when my daughter got home from school she said that her therapist had misunderstood once again and that she wasn’t actually suicidal.  Today was her normal therapy session and my daughter was out sick. I emailed the therapist to let her know, and I wound up getting several phone calls from the therapist wanting to talk to my daughter to make sure she was okay. I reassured her that my daughter was fine, but at her insistence I let her speak with my daughter for a minute.   This just seems really intrusive and weird. Has anyone else dealt with anything like this before?  Edit: I would like to add some further details. I  a single mom and my daughter is my entire world. We don’t keep secrets around here, as neither of us was born with a poker face and we tell each other all the time how much we love one another.

We would have some difficult moments or days periodically but then get back to a comfortable stride, however, lately they are both soooo damn intense. Like - tantrums, crying, fighting, screaming, not listening more than usual. And without much relief. I dig so deep for the patience they need from me (like insanely deep for me, I’m not a naturally easy breezy person) but somehow I break everyday. I yell, I say “ENOUGHHHH!!! Stop! Just stooooop” and my internal dialogue is absolutely filled with anger and fury (I don’t hit them, I come from a violent home- but I feel it under the surface and I have had to intentionally yank myself back from being aggressive).   My husband is truly a partner to me and a father to them, even he sees that they are particularly more intense with me than him or his parents (they help us when we both are working)- of course they are still intense at times, but they are full-blown unhinged with me.

Since the depression started (when baby was about three and a half months old), I find it very hard to spend time with baby, I struggle to stay active and engaged with her/keep her entertained. I regularly feel desperate and like I don't know how I'll make it through and fill the hours until bedtime. She is a very happy and unfussy baby, it's not like I'm dealing with crying all day-- the problem is definitely me.  I'm making efforts to go for walks, go to the library, I've joined a playgroup, etc. Baby loves being in a busy environment and listening to conversation, it's just really tough when it's just her and me alone at home, and most activities are only in the morning and then there's still the whole rest of the day to get through (baby is also not much of a daytime sleeper, only two forty minute naps most days).  Can I get some stories of mums who successfully made it through ppd, and/or advice? My partner is encouraging me to keep the TV on in the background to help pass the time, but I'm worried about developmental effects.",

We went to dinner at the Mall and then popped into the supermarket to buy some stuff. Arriving at home I opened the boot and my daughter put her hand in and grabbed a packet of salty chips that my wife bought. I said 'you cant eat that now, its bed time'. She rolled her eyes at me and made a remark. If I were not there I think my wife would not have cared and let her eat that crap.   Sometimes I think its me against my wife/child. They stick together, kind of against me.   What should I do to improve the relationship with my daughter?  thanks",

    "self_text": "I found out Friday that I'm 5 weeks pregnant. There was a point in our marriage that we really wanted children, and I'd cry whenever the test was negative.   I have PCOS, and my periods were never normal. About 2 years ago I started keto, felt amazing, and my periods came back. I fell in love with myself in a way I've never known and lost 100lbs. I finished school and started my dream job. We were barely scaping by during college and now we are doing pretty good for oursevles. We've expanded our hobbies, settled down from partying, and became happy with the childfree lifestyle and didn't think about children at all.   Over the past handful or so of months my husband has been talking about maybe getting a vasectomy. We ended up getting pregnant on our anniversary (unintentionally) instead.   Our plans have been built around not having children. More college, traveling in a way that doesn't accommodate kids, both of us working. It's hard to picture children fitting into our lives.   When we found out, we both agreed on abortion almost immediately. It's had time to sink in aince then, and now we are on the fence. I made a \"reasons to keep\" and \"reasons to not keep\" list and all of my not keep points are concrete and far outweigh the bullet points that sound like \"maybe I will like it\" in the \"keep\" side.   Do people worry if they will hate parenting? Having a baby sounds terrifying. I don't want to lose my identity to being a mom. I'm worried I won't be myself anymore, or that we won't have the same quality time as we planned for a childfree life. I'm worried it will shred our plans. I just don't think we are ready, and neither does he. I don't feel confident about bringing a baby into the state we live, or into the world for that matter. I don't want this to financially ruin us. There are some nasty medical conditions on mom's side of the family (postpartum cardio myopathy) and I don't want to die.   We're also kind of excited. I can't stop myself from researching, pulling out developmental psych books from college, and running to the bathroom so I can pull up my t shirt and wonder what's going on in there. I love that I'm pregnant, but I don't know if I love the idea of not knowing what life looks like from here. Or if I will enjoy it.   Edit   I cried and cried my eyes out reading these comments. My eye lids are puffy and my face hurts and I think I really do want to keep it. Just because I had a change of heart doesn't mean my husband feels the same. He doesn't feel like we are ready. I don't know how I feel about doing this to him and our marriage. I love him more than I want a baby, but this is just so hard and I can't grapple with all the tears. Thank you guys so much for your support. I have loved reading your advice and learning about your journeys. I will update soon",

    "self_text": "My daughter is two and a half, born during the start of the pandemic. She was an only child until 5 months ago when her little sister was born. I always kinda figured that eventually she would get to a point where she would just play by herself, but it still hadn't happened by the time her sister was born.  Now it's becoming a bit of a problem because my wife is trying to put the baby down for a nap while I'm at work, and the toddler is just sitting around in our room, waiting for my wife to be finished. She could be expending energy playing by herself, but she isn't. And sometimes the baby wakes up once or twice during her nap and has to be put back to sleep while the toddler is just messing around in the bedroom. By the time it's time for the toddler's nap she hasn't used enough energy to go to sleep. This affects her evening mood and the whole dynamic of the household.   She won't play by herself. She wants momma or daddy to be playing with her.  What have you all done to introduce and encourage independent play?",

There was a momentary pause then a bloodcurdling scream. She shouted “No, no! Can’t eat Turkey! Baby turkeys will be sad and miss their mama! No!!”   So I was like okay, you don’t want to eat Turkey meat anymore? She’s been adamant the answer is “No” for weeks now.   I’ve been vegetarian and vegan in the past, although not since kids. So I understand and accept her aversion. I’m proud of her compassion for all creatures. I won’t force her to eat it or even force her to watch me eat it. So I guess it’s Tofurkey for all of us lol!

    "title": "Talking to children about other parenting styles",
    "self_text": "It seems really confusing to my toddler when we’re at a family function and there’s another child there and the parent hurts their child or threatens to hurt their child.   She asked me why is her mommy trying to hurt her? I thought you said your jobs are to keep your kids safe. I just told her I’m not sure, not all parents are the same, some parents hurt their child for not listening and think hurting them teaches them to listen. Not all parents parent like mommy does.   She just went quiet and she watched the situation continue to play out. The mom went to get a belt to use to threaten her toddler and said this is what makes her listen, other family members there were saying that they don’t blame her for getting a belt. She gets a belt and said now watch how fast she listens and she just made the belt make a popping sound, yelled at her little girl to get in the bathroom so she could change her diaper and the girl took off running and crying hysterically, ran past the bathroom, and ended up running to another family member. She looked terrified. My daughter looked at me and said her nana will protect her (the family member she ran to). And she says I don’t think hurting her makes her listen all the time. And I told her she was right. Kids don’t listen all the time when they should and when they don’t listen their parents should discipline them. I told her disciplining is to guide but to some parents that means to hurt.  She went well if I don’t listen then I don’t get to watch cartoons later and I like losing tv time if that means you’ll keep me safe.  I thought it’s funny she said that, tv time is about the only thing she’ll work for so I make her earn her TV time and she loses it if she misbehaves badly enough. It’s just one of the more common consequences because it’s about the only one that works.   My children were happily playing almost the entire time. There were a couple moments where the other girl kept waiting for them to set toys down so she could run off with it and it turned into my kids not wanting to share with her, but it was short lived and after a little chatting, they were sharing with her.  My youngest had one fit that was very short lived after I had to take him out of something for not playing properly and he didn’t do it again.   The little girl there was in hysterics like not the entire time but it seemed like when we weren’t eating or the few moments they were playing nicely, she was crying. It started over her wanting to take something from my son, the mom snatched her up and squeezed her arms and told her she had to ask nicely for the toy my son had and she went immediately into hysterics. Moments pass, my son set the toy down and she comes over and grabs the toy and my son said hey to her because he was still planning on playing with it. I told him hey dude, that’s not our toy and you set it down so she can have a turn with it now. He followed her and was sulking quietly and the mom took the toy from her and yelled he was still playing with that you have to share!! And gave it to my son. I said something to the mom like it’s okay she can have a turn, but she didn’t listen because her daughter went into hysterics and my son stood there for a moment before he handed it back to her and said here, you can have a turn. She stopped crying but it wasn’t long before it was something else and between the mom threatening her and just overall being a crap parent, of course the girl was crying the majority of them time. At one point while crying the mom even stuck her finger in her daughters face and said now every body point and laugh at her crying, then pointed her finger at her and said ha ha ha.   It was just mean and I felt bad for the little girl. I get such crap from my family for not spanking my kids, but then they turn around and tell me my kids are so well behaved. I’m confident in my parenting style and I never thought I’d have to defend my parenting but I live in the Deep South where people act like you’re doing your child a disservice if you don’t spank your kids. I never understood why some people need to insert their opinion of how they think you should hurt your kid for something. I’ve rarely said to parents that they shouldn’t hurt their child, the few times I have, they were about to hurt their child over something I knew well enough about to see that the child didn’t do anything so I was just trying to defend them.   How’s everyone else get by for the holidays? Idk if it’s because we just don’t act that way at my house, but my daughter seemed genuinely concerned for the other girl. She didn’t seem content with the answers I gave her and to be fair, she had a point. I’m huge on trying to set a good example of how we should treat each other by Modeling desired behavior instead of trying to control theirs. And when we do face situations like this, I want to teach her about it, but I don’t want her thinking it’s okay without creating conflict. Parents should protect their kids and they should comfort them when they’re upset. Not hurt them and taunt them when they cry. I’ve had this happen before with a neighbor and we just don’t spend time with them but the way it created conflict was my daughter told the mom we don’t hurt each other at our house. They had just came over to play out in our front yard and the mom gestured towards her daughter for not taking turns in the right order on the slide and the girl ran and said don’t hurt me mom. The mom said well that’s what happens when we don’t listen and my daughter said to her we don’t hurt each other at my house. The mom looked at me like I was supposed to correct my daughter but I didn’t and it was just awkward but nothing more came of it. That is a rule our house so I wasn’t sure what to say. I was pretty proud of her for sticking up for her friend. But it was obviously inappropriate to the other parent, maybe that wasn’t really conflict but it was just awkward more than anything. I also felt bad for that girl because how dumb is it that the mom was going to spank her when they were playing happily and the only thing wrong is they got out of order so someone would have gone down the slide twice before the other got a turn. We’re talking about one of those kiddie Fisher Price slides, nothing special.",

We can hear her talking to herself but she will be asleep by the time the 4 year old enters the room at around 8:30 PM. 4 year old will bounce in and out of bed and will need a parent sitting in a chair outside the bedroom, with the door open, but he will be asleep by 9 or 9:15 PM. Parents have a little time to themselves and can watch a TV show before going to bed.  Here’s what’s starting to happen with more frequency:  2 year old is still awake at 8:30 or even 8:45 when the 4 year old enters. The two of them keep each other awake. One or both of them starts crying. One parent has to take the 4 year old out into the living room while the other one staying the room to put the 2 year old back to sleep. 4 year old re-enters the room at 9:45 and isn’t asleep until past 10. Everyone’s night is ruined.  Logistics: the kids share a small bedroom. There’s a room divider which is meant to block out the night light that the 4 year old prefers. Obviously, moving to a larger home is not an option right now, otherwise we would’ve done that a long time ago.  Any ideas on how to make this more manageable? Any ideas would be appreciated.

    "self_text": "Hi all.   Today was my 8yr old daughters' class year end picnic. The teacher usually sends pics of school events on the class WhatsApp group. I noticed that my daughter was yet again in the pic alone. Other kids were in groups of 2 to 3. Out of the whole year she has only been together with other kids twice. The rest of the time she is alone in pics. This afternoon I asked her out about it and she said that she sat alone during the picnic. She has not made any close friends since entering primary school and I am worried that somewhere there is a problem. The teacher have not said anything and I can't think that my daughter is off-putting to the other kids ie bulling. She is a people pleaser so she can be a bit of a teachers' pet and is entering the pre- puberty stage so she can get emotional a bit. She has not been invited to any birthday parties or playdates in 3 years apart from a girl in her grade that lives in the same complex as us.   What is really bothering me, is her lack of close friends at school.  Do I just let her sort it out? Do we go see a therapist? I am planning to talk to the teacher soon and see if she observed anything.  Any advice for me?",

    "self_text": "As title says I went to the dentist with my son today and it was rough.   He has had a cavity that needed a filling for many, many months now. We attempted to get it filled initially but he didn't let them anywhere near his mouth so we couldn't get it done that way. We decided that he would need laughing gas so they could get the work done and as much as I didn't like it I agreed it would be the only way. I know my son and he has a history of fighting with practitioners physically if they try to give him shots, take blood, etc.   So finally after reschedules due to multiple illness we went today. I did my absolute best to talk it through with him beforehand, and even did some role playing with what getting the mask on would be like. I talked about what my experience was like. He asked if he would feel anything while asleep and what to do if he did, and he said he would do it.   Fast forward to being in the chair and he was obviously not okay. He wouldn't let them put the stickers on him for the ekg machine and was already agitated, so they tell him it's okay, we will just do the mask. The guy goes to put the mask on him and he completely flips out. It takes a team of four people to hold him down while he screamed at them DON'T, STOP, STOP IT. It took much longer then the 10-15 seconds they said it would to get him out, and he admitted later that he was holding his breath until he finally ended up screaming it all out. The whole time I'm holding his hand to his chest and watching the whole fucking thing happen and as much as I hated it I knew it was the only way this was going to happen.  I just barely got the kid out of the car. If a vee hadn't flown in the back seat when I opened the door he never would have gotten out so that I could scoop him up on to my back to go inside.   It was completely traumatic for both of us and now I'm dreading what dental check ups and any possible cavity fillings will be like in the future. I think I've decided to switch dentists so that he isn't triggered by being in that office. It's a nice office and the staff are great, I just don't know if we can stay with that practice any longer. To top it all off it was so deep from having to go on for so long g that it was just on the pulp which increases the chance for a root canal needing to be done on that tooth. I don't think you can use gas for that and if there are needles involved I guarantee he will try to rip them out.   I just need to know that someone has dealt with this with their child and that there was something they did for their kid that made things any better. Talking things and playing things through just doesn't help. He admitted that next time he should just do it instead of fighting but who knows how he will really react. He is only 7 so he just isn't ready for anxiety medication. I'm not opposed to it when he is a little bit older--I take meds myself. I just wish I could help him more than just holding him down and promising it'll be okay.  TLDR; son and I had traumatic experience at his dentist and I'm struggling to find a way to move forward from it.",

He hates having to do this stuff  Tried contacting lawyers for help with a court order but no one replies/calls me back- clear sign that I have no case at all  I'm paying for a house for me and him that he barely visits.

    "self_text": "First off, this may be an r/unpopularopinion, but I see candy as an unfortunate but inescapable part of American life. It's not good for you in so many ways and it's designed and manufactured to be as enticing and addictive as possible, but it's so ubiquitous that avoidance it isn't an option.  Up until now, my approach to [hard] candy has been that I don't buy it, but if someone gives it to my kids they're free to eat it. And of course lots of people give my kids candy, so there's no lack of exposure there. (MIL sends big bags of candy for holidays, the doctors give them suckers, playmates and their parents them fruit snacks and various candies, barber gives them skittles, and even the dentist gives them sugar-free suckers.)  But yesterday we had our first big trick-or-treating experience, and my kids came home with buckets of candy, probably as much as they've eaten in the last several months at least. I've been trying to follow an \"intuitive eating\" approach to other foods, and from the 6 intuitive eating blogs I just finished reading, intuitive eating is supposed to work with candy as well. But I'm torn because deep down I don't believe my kids have the capacity to be intuitive about candy yet. If left to their own devices, I fear they will eat until they're sick and then keep eating. Should I just allow this to happen? But then what if I do, and they eat until it's gone, but they  don't  feel sick and only want more? What's the lesson there?  I'm really struggling to find my role here as a parent. Should I be providing  more  candy so my kids can learn to self-regulate, or should I by trying to limit their candy intake and teaching them to eat a healthy balanced diet by only providing a healthy balanced diet? The former feels so wrong to me, and the latter doesn't square with intuitive eating. My spouse's current approach is to limit them to 1 piece of candy with each meal, a decent compromise I suppose, but now they're asking for candy non-stop. Literally every few minutes. And I fear we're creating a \"scarcity\" mentality by artificially limiting it and hurting their taste for normal food by giving them 3 daily side-by-side comparisons with the dopamine hit of pure sugar.  TLDR: Does intuitive eating work for toddlers and candy? How do you handle Halloween? What has and hasn't worked for you?",

    "self_text": "So I’m asking not to ask how to eliminate being tired or touched out all together since we all know that’s impossible. But as my baby gets older it’s going to be something I am going to  be thinking about more- preventing being OVERLY touched out, being Unnecessarily burnt out more than you realized you maybe needed to be.   This can be its own question without explanation, but I’m also asking this for a specific reason as well:  I’ve seen one post from a parent  whos recent injury prevented them from actively playing with their 2 year old and it got me thinking of moms with physical limitations that they can’t get on the floor and be treated like a human jungle gym (considering this is the very thing they say lead to them feeling touched out anyway). But it made me realize how many parents physically can’t match the toddlers energy all day or even pick them up for long stretches. They have to get creative with how to spend time with their toddlers that doesn’t risk their own physical health.   I myself am also a very low energy person with back problems so I worry how this may translate when the baby is another year older and is requiring more physical play that i may not be able to keep up with day in and day out.   So for moms who have an injury/physical health concerns, heavily pregnant with the next kid, or simply don’t have the energy to physically play with their toddlers, what were the activities you did that allowed some kind of rest while your kid burned their energy that day?  Did you just take them to the park?  Did you sit and blow bubbles for them to chase?  Did you give them a scavenger hunt to find items around the house to return to you?  These are just some examples parents gave me here and there, but i’d like to hear more any specific activities your kid did while preserving your own energy as best as you could.  (i realize a partner to take over may be an obvious answer, but i’m referring more to a situation where they are not able to be around and you are watching the kids all day.)  (A lot of parents are nervous how not physically letting them all over you will show them they aren’t loved, but obviously we need space as parents and can’t be holding them 24/7 for many reasons as listed above. We can’t subject ourselves to be human jungle gyms every day, so this post is asking about that specific fear too- how to allow some sanity and rest while still showing the kid you love them and like to play, even if that doesn’t look like you being treated like Mount Everest.  Edit: I am talking more about a 2 year old and not an almost 4 year old toddler. The younger the better for any answer you may have! thanks!",

The dayhome is ok, my son seems content to go there, and in the few months he's been there he has settled in and made friends with the other children. There are some things I don't care for about the place, but daycare spaces in general are very hard to come by in my area so I've been trying to overlook some of these things and just be grateful we have a spot. For example, the food provided is not always nutritious, but I know they just want the kids to eat something. Or the fact that the TV is on more often than not, and there isn't a huge toy selection for the older kids. Sometimes I think my son is bored there. But I know they do other activities like crafts and outdoor play to keep the kids entertained. I do like the home type environment and small group, as well as the fact we are able to use the space part time (2-3 days a week is all we need) and only pay for days we use it.  The daycare center on the other hand, obviously has way more to offer in terms of activities and toys, and I could send healthier lunches. But it's a large group of kids, and while I know they are within proper ratios, I worry my son will get lost in the shuffle. Also, we would have to pay for a full time spot, at least to start, but could maybe go part time only if they find another family that could share the spot. Not only that, but this is not our first choice center which is in the school he will be attending. So we will have to switch again at some point in the future when a space opens up but it could be a year or more before that happens.  I know the daycare center seems like the logical choice just based on a better environment. But I feel so guilty taking my son away from his friends and a place that is familiar to him now. It took a while for him to get really comfortable where he is. I also feel guilty taking away the dayhome provider's income, and I dont know how she would feel about my son leaving either. I even feel bad for the other children that they would lose a friend from their little group. But at the same time I feel guilty not giving my son this opportunity that would maybe be more beneficial to his growth and development.   Is it better to just keep my son where he is with the friends he's made? Or move him to a new place that might be better for him? Even if its just temporary until we get in to our first choice? Sorry for the long post.",

We need to do a cull, but he remembers every little thing he owns and notices when something is missing when I do any kind of sneaky Goodwill cull.  How do I go about doing this? He’s too old for some of his toys, but insists that he needs them and some toys just don’t get played with. I don’t want him to end up surrounded by toys like those kids on YouTube and I want to make sure he understands the importance of passing along items he’s outgrown.",

    "self_text": "My 6yo and I can have some real trouble sometimes. He is usually well behaved but sometimes things don't work well. Sometimes it's a power struggle and he needs the safety of consistent boundaries. I've learned mostly how to deal with that.   Sometimes it's my anxiety clashing with his ADHD/sensory seeking behavior. He climbs all over the place while he's talking, gets a sentence halfway out then starts over or takes forever to say the whole thing, wants to suddenly touch me with no warning or lick me or say dumb things. It wears on me.   I've tried all kinds of interventions and he reflexively refuses to do any of them, mostly because it's something I'm encouraging him to do. I tell him \"it's ok to wiggle but I need you to use the yoga swing to do that or be on the floor in front of me\". I tell him many times \"I don't like to be touched unexpectedly so please be sure I'm ready to play that type of game before you touch me.\" He doesn't remember.   I'm in a paid parenting group online that is run by a child psychologist, and in a recent group training we were told to put a reminder in our phones about a behavior that triggers us. My son saw it and asked what it was. It says \"I expect (son) to be wild and loud. I can cope with this.\" I explained to him that my brain tells me I'm not safe when people are moving around unpredictably near my body, but this is part of who he is and I'm trying to remind myself to expect him to be that way so my brain doesn't get so upset. He seemed to accept that.   Sometimes the issue is him not listening (which is probably also ADHD related some of the time, but he is still waiting on an official evaluation). That, plus him opposing everything I suggest to modify his behavior, and I get drained and frustrated.   A couple of days ago I tried really hard to spend quality time with him. I struggle to participate in his chosen activities, and we often do our own thing near each other vs doing something together because he doesn't want to do anything I find enjoyable and there's only so much I can make myself do pretend play or whatever. But I really tried. And he was listening poorly, a lot. I kept pointing it out. It all came to a head and I got so angry, I went to his dad and said you have to take over and went away and cried feeling like such a failure as a mother. Why can't I get my child to listen? He listens to dad, somewhat better than to me, and it makes me feel like crap. He listens to his teacher pretty well too. I understand that kids often feel safer with mom and that can lead to acting out. But I am so tired of being unheard.   I hate it when I try to spend good time with him and he argues, refuses to do things, wants to control every detail. I end up getting fed up and saying if you don't want to cooperate then I guess you can play by yourself.   I'm not sure what I'm asking for except maybe solidarity? It's just hard to get kids to listen sometimes. People say boys don't listen to their mothers. I don't know if that sort of gender based axiom has validity or not. My sister-in-law has all girls and they seem to listen to her much better than my son listens to me, even though she and I both have similar personalities and parenting philosophies.  I also struggle with having any energy to do educational enrichment after a full work day. Maybe that's a separate post though. I feel like he is wasting his potential and could be developing himself more if I made more effort at home. Instead I'm lazy, telling myself he's smart enough that he can still do well in his life even if I don't spend an hour a day practicing his enrichment activities with him. But then I feel guilty because I could be robbing him if future scholarship money by being lazy about this stuff.   So  tl;dr **: My 6yo listens poorly sometimes.  His sensory seeking/hyperactivity triggers anxiety and makes me want to get away from him.  Most of what he wants to do I find horribly boring so I can't do much of it, and he is overly controlling about a lot of other activities.  This, plus the poor listening and the need to run around and touch me impulsively make me kind of hate hanging out with him. I need help.",

Everything I read is put him down drowsy but awake but this is his drowsy stage so Im at a loss about what to do. Is it too early for separation anxiety? Thing is that even if I put him down for a nap next to me, where we are touching the entire time, he still goes through this process and wakes up arms flailing. We roomshare, he can always see me at night, Im always an arms length away.   Overtired? Maybe, it seems like he doesnt sleep enough but we try our best to get him down for a nap every 2 hours. It seems like he sleeps often but not very long. The idea of letting him cry it out makes me very upset, I dont think I could handle that, but is that my only option at this point?",

    "self_text": "Part of this may be venting but we are out of ideas and we are all frustrated to no end.  Backstory: We is me, my husband, my step sons mother and her husband.  We parents are all on the same page with my step son.  We love each other, there isn’t any fighting between the parents.  Like co parenting isn’t a problem with us.  Our problem is our kid.  We will call him Joe.  I  have been in my steps sons life since he was a small child.  So he’s always known me as his other mom.  He’s 13 now.  His mother is one of my best friends.  The problem: he’s a smart kid when it comes to getting what he wants.  He tried to play us off each other constantly.  And because we use to buy his lies, it took us all getting together and realizing what he does to get his way and try to put a stop to it.  When he saw we were all on the same page his lying escalated horribly.  He has told his dad and I that his step dad choked him out and his mom hits him for no reason other than he was disagreeing with his step dad.   We at first we’re concerned and asked his mother what happened and she said that it wasn’t true, she yelled at him and took his phone because he was back talking her and her husband stepped in to get him out of her face when he was threatening to hit her.  Step son shoved her into the wall.  She is smaller than he is.  Now that’s just one incident.  There have been others, like him taking a sledge hammer to the outside of their house because she wouldn’t let him go unsupervised with his friends somewhere.  Fed up his mother asked if we could start taking him more.  He was causing issues between her and her husband.  We of course agreed.  Then he told his mother that I hit him and his father beats him.  Which is untrue.  We just do not allow him to hang out with his friends until he can pass a nicotine and drug test.  He’s been failing.  He begged his mom to go back to her house because the friends he hangs out with live in her neighborhood.  He’s threatened to kill himself and run away when we take his phone and his gaming computer.  We put him in therapy.  Therapy has recently told us there isn’t much more they can do for him.  They reduced his sessions from 2 times a week to one time a month because he’s not getting anything from the sessions.  He gets straight F’s.  He doesn’t listen in school.  When the teacher tried taking his phone after he was warned so many times over the course of 2 months he freaked out and said not to call his dad because he’s afraid his dad will hurt him.  Which the teacher took seriously of course.  He just didn’t want his phone taken away and he thought lying would get him sympathy and get him out of trouble.  Child protective services visited both of our homes to ensure he was safe.  We told them we are desperate, nothing is working.  They told us get him therapy.  ☹️. We informed them we have him in therapy.  It sucks so bad to be accused of something you don’t do.  Therapy upped his visits to 4 times a month again.  We just don’t know what to do.  He cares about nothing but his phone and friends.  But taking away his phone and his friends doesn’t make him try in school or stop causing trouble.  Today I get like the bajillionth call from the school saying I have to pick him up.  He knows the magic words to say to the nurse that forces them to send him home.  He knows to say he hit his head and he’s dizzy. (I’ve picked him up 7 times in 6 months for this lie) Or he says he doesn’t feel good and lists two of the symptoms from the covid posters all over the school.  He’s out at least 1-2 times a week for this.  And if he lists the covid symptoms I have to leave work to take him to the doctor for a covid screening because they don’t accept rapid test results.  So he gets two days off school each time as we wait for the labs.  I asked the school nurse today is there any way they could just keep him, that I know he’s lying and none of us can pick him up right now.  She said “I’m sorry, but that sounds like a Home problem” and I lost my cool.  I said “no, it’s a school problem that he’s a failing student and a licensed nurse can’t identify an actually sick child from one that comes into her office weekly with the same made up symptoms.” Not my finest moment, but her tone and stuff set me off.  I have lost my last part time job over this already.  My husband is the bread winner in our home.  My step sons mother and step dad both have low paying jobs and can barely make their house bills so they can’t take off work.  I have a 6 year old son with special needs as well, so I have to also be around when he’s not in school making it impossible for me to have a full time regular job.  Money is super tight.  Christmas is looking really bleak right now if I can’t earn money.  I know other people have it worse. Maybe someone has more ideas.  We don’t know what to do anymore.  Help.",

The program is through the local school system, which was not told me initially. My kid has been fighting off cold after cold and ear infection after infection. We have been to the doctor for this and have been prescribed antibiotics. He has a cough at night so his sleep has been disrupted for a month now, and it has made him irritable. With all of this said, I am not opposed to ADHD meds, however, with 4 years old I believe there needs to be something very serious going on to even mention something like this. Also, having someone observe him in school and our parenting after only a week or so of him acting up seems very extreme. I don’t want him to receive a label this early in his development, that could possibly follow him and determine things in his life, when he’s only 4 years old.

My 22 month old son has always been an excellent night time sleeper, never had any issues going to bed, would without a word of a lie would be put in his cot after reading a book and go straight to sleep. The last 2 weeks or so the second we start towards his room he starts a screaming tantrum like we are torturing him.  However if we lay next to him in our bed or the spare bed he stops screaming immediately and then we just wait for him to fall asleep. We thought it might have something to do with him maybe not wanting to sleep in the cot so a few nights have tried him sleeping in the spare bed but the results are the same, screaming murder if we leave him alone and having to lay next to him till he falls asleep. We also thought maybe it was because he wasn't tired so kept him up a bit later, but the kid will be literally falling asleep on us and the second we leave him alone in the room he's awake and not happy.

My baby only takes two naps that are less than an hour long. I'm considering putting him in daycare so that I can sleep, but all the daycares I've contacted have waitlists. I have no family available to watch him. There is a local nanny I've found for $18/hr but that seems very expensive, I'd only be making about $22/hr.  Daycare is $50/day in my area.   Any advice would be appreciated!",

    "title": "Ideas to help my 10 year old son with digital media?",
    "self_text": "Okay, I'll try to make this as concise as possible:  I have a 10-year-old son and I perceive how digital media is gaining traction and other activities are taking a back seat. (We are talking about Fortnite, Stumble Guys, and YouTube gaming channels. He doesn't have a smartphone yet.)  There is no crisis yet, he is doing well in school, still doing things with the family, doing chores etc. Neither it's about his total screen time, we have some restrictions in place (an hour a day during work week) and he is as compliant as you might expect from a 10 year- old. The system might be leaking but the overall time seems acceptable.  But: We feel that even if not actually sitting in front of the screen his mind is very much drawn to it, surely hoping for the opportunity to use it when we are unaware of it. That starts blocking him from doing anything else – or anything else just has lost its appeal?  E. g., he has played soccer for four years now and always loved it, but recently stopped going. Not because he doesn’t like it but because „he doesn’t feel like it“ (or feeling headaches or bellyaches) when the moment to leave home arrives. So even if he commits to some activity in general, when the moment arrives he backs out.  Right now has no structured activity from 4pm on - doing essentially nothing (reading comics, listening to audio dramas, taking a bath…), waiting for his screen hour to start at 6.30pm.  What would be your take on this?",

    "self_text": "We need help. We have been dealing with our son’s behavior issues at preschool for almost 2 years now. Not only does he have a bad attention seeking problem, but he keeps physically hurting other kids and sometimes teachers. We went to the pediatrician, she told us to try child find (public school system), he only had minor sensory issues so he didn’t qualify for services. Then we started occupational therapy. The school ( a Montessori) did some of the things the therapist recommended, but not all. There would be a lot of “well he doesn’t like that visual schedule “ or we don’t have the resources for that. Then they asked us to switch therapists, so when we did there was a 6 week wait to get into childrens hospital OT program. I guess the school got impatient and a teacher made a false accusation against us to CPS, we think to get us to leave, then they apologized, and then asked us to leave a month later after forcing us to 1/2 days. Our son had friends there and we didn’t think it was good to leave, so we kept putting up with it, but it did get really toxic. In hindsight a poor choice for us to try and stay. We went back to the pediatrician and started asking about adhd, which she says it’s too early to diagnose. We also went back to child find and they said he still didn’t qualify. So then we started at an in home daycare the same time we started childrens OT and play therapy with a child psychologist.  Both therapists blame the broken school systems say he is good and that they don’t see issues. They think that the teachers can just bend over backwards to support his behaviors. Now the in home daycare lady wouldn’t do anything the therapists recommended. I even took videos of the therapists, pushed the therapists to make it easier and small and simple. Used these at home too and still she would just role her eyes at me. Even today when she said he is hitting too much and we have to leave. I asked if she had been trying those things from the therapists and she said he doesn’t like them.   What do we do? No one is able to help. I feel like it’s better with us. He doesn’t behave as they describe on play dates or at soccer practice. He does occasionally at swimming, but it’s not at the same level. He is very smart and always trying to find ways to not follow directions. Always trying to negotiate with everyone and trying make it so it was his choice.   I see him all the time play nice and be a nice caring child. I don’t understand and I feel like maybe we have been lead down the wrong path.   Lastly at home we have had some progress over the last two years. It used to be worse at home and he would get physical with us too. Not any more, but he does scream and yell now instead.  we are obviously frustrated and not sure about next steps. Please help.",

    "self_text": "My 8 year old got off the bus today absolutely trying to hold it in. Once the bus pulled away, he lost it. Should I contact the bus company or just let it go?  Up until yesterday, he sat at the front of the bus, but due to other kids’ behavior issues, he was moved to one at the back. He used to sit with his 6 year old sister. Now he’s at the back of the bus. It sounds like he’s never sat back there before. Also, The bus driver has a microphone but my son says she doesn’t use it.   Here is what happened. He had turned around in his seat to talk to a friend directly behind him. Apparently there were other kids too, but I don’t know. He says he never did it before because his friends were in front of him when he sat at the front. He said he got on his knees and turned around. The bus driver started asking him to turn around. He says he couldn’t hear her (which I believe is true, because he was at the back and the it’s a bus filled with elementary aged kids lol). She began screaming his name to the point other kids began calling for him. He realized at this point that people were calling him, and he turned around. The bus driver told him to sit down on his butt. She then continued on. When they got to his stop, she yelled at him to the point he was almost in tears before he got off the bus. I was about 30 seconds late getting there so I only saw him getting off the bus. He held it in until we got home. It took over an hour to calm him down, he was crying so hard. He was scared and embarrassed to be yelled at like that.  I explained that she wanted him to sit forward because it’s safer but she could have handled it better (use the microphone and not yell at him before he got off the bus). I have heard rumors about her being pretty strict to kids but mine have never had an issue until today. They’ve also only ever sat at the front.  Do I say something to the school? Or let it go and let him handle it and learn from it? Being a kid is hard :( I do want him to ride safely but I don’t like spending an hour calming my kid down because an adult berated him.",

This includes taking toys if she’s not playing with them nicely, have her sit by me while I do a chore if she’s not listening, or taking away tv time.  She’s also acting out at school - doesn’t listen to the rules on what she is supposed to be doing and keeping her hands to herself. She’ll push and say the other kid did it first.  I’ve recently tried a rewards system but it seems like she wants the reward when the days starts and then by the time I pick her up (and she’s lost the reward by making bad choices) she just doesn’t care or thinks she should get it anyway.  I’m a single mom and I’m making sure she’s getting as much attention as I can give her but I feel like it’s all negative or becomes a battle of wills.  If I get it to where she does care about losing a reward it turns it into a complete meltdown. I’m talking pulling on my clothes, screaming, begging, ect.

I know that he is still really young and doesn't quite understand that babies are fragile and need to be cared for alot, and I do understand that he may be feeling jealous as he now has to share his mum.

Any other tips I can try 🤷‍♂️pic  Update: don’t bother drawing over it, it only made it worse. Go straight for the nail polish remover. Many thanks for that suggestion 👍💪🥰  Update2: the pen used was a colour change pen. When drawn over it with a special pen will change the colour.

Wife has been late for a few days and it got me scared and worried. I'm a stay at home dad, taking the girls to and from school, after school programs, play dates, etc. Been like this for the last 8+ years. Wife is a RN and the bread winner and I'm so thankful for that. I've been her number one fan and supporter the 15 years we've been together. Having a 3rd isn't what scared me it was the financial aspect and her well being. She recently has a gastric surgery and has been losing weight and just feeling amazing about all the weight lost, and she reassured me that even with that having a baby wouldn't pose any issues than normal (because she's an RN). I'm not the smartest man and I'm not good with finances like she is so when she tells me not to worry I try not to even though it's hard.   Sorry for getting off track just a lot on my mind. All day we texted while she was at working talking about what it's. Then we just started saying screw it because she's been consistent with her monthly visitor for the last several months so maybe she was pregnant. My mind was racing all the good and bad things of having a baby at 35 with older children and what not. Like we have the room for another that's not the issue, she wouldn't really have to put her career on hold because I'll be home and with the girls I'm sure they'll help daddy take care of the baby lol. So my mind started thinking of ways the tell the girls and family and friends but still being worried about what to do next...  Well her period was late... it started today while at work. While it was a sigh of relief but now I'm thinking it wasn't. Been thinking about holding that little girl/boy all day, been feeling incomplete for some reason and I can't shake this feeling. There's more to our story but I don't want to bore with all the details of our life.  Not asking for pros or cons of having a third, honestly I don't know what I'm asking, maybe advice, guidance, or just needed to rant and get some outside input from others that have 2 or 3 or more children and hear from your experience.

    "title": "Son(6m) has never slept through the night....HALP!",
    "self_text": "Okay reddit...i need your magic.  Here's the situation at hand:  I have a 18 month old and a 6m old who share a room...or are supposed to be at this point. My son is still sleeping in our (myself and husband's) bedroom in a bassinet. He has never slept through the night yet, not even close. He wakes up at least twice a night to eat, sometimes three. He doesn't even feed much before he falls asleep again lately, but he will not settle unless he has at least a few gulps of food. He is, in all definitions of the word, inconsolable. I have tried everything i can think of to get him to sleep through the night. Different bassinets, every different swaddle/sleep sack, feedings/no feedings, cry-it-out, rocking, walking, talking, shushing, pacifiers, and finally a change in formula (which i'll come back to in a moment). He is my third (and definitely last) baby. The fact I cant figure him out, is mindboggling. I can't keep going on without sleep. I am slowly losing my mind.  Until about 2 weeks ago, he was hysterical and inconsolable all day long, too. He spent 90% of his days crying. I asked the doctors why he is so fussy, and they said \"maybe colic?\" or \"yeah, they do that, hardee-harr-harr\". He seemed to just always need food for comfort; He is a chonker from all the food (about 35-40oz/day). The doctors just kept telling me to to feed him when he needs it. He eventually started spitting up after almost every bottle after about an hour or so of finishing eating. I decided to change his formula to the spit of formula (Gerber purple can). The store was sold out, but did have soy, so we tried it. Well, all his daytime fussiness immediately started to improve and has now resolved. I'm assuming he has a milk allergy or intolerance. The doctors REALLY dropped the ball on this. I am so upset he was in pain for almost 6 months. In retrospect, he would arch his back and crunch his belly. He didnt seem to have more than normal gas, but his stool had always been watery and a little yellow. I thought it was just the way his poop was, since it was like that since he was born (after the meconium stools ended after birth). Now his stool is normal dark green paste and he is happy 95% of the day. He requires less food (~30oz a day).  The nighttime is still a disaster though. He turns off and insists on going to bed at 8pm, on the dot. He sleeps for 3-4 hours and wakes for comfort feeds. I recently got him fleece blanket sleeper pjs to keep him warmer, which slightly helped last night, but its too soon to tell. He woke up last night at 11:30pm and 5am to eat and finished both bottles. I know he is definitely teething and in a good deal of pain; No teeth have emerged yet. I give him Tylenol when he is extra fussy and in obvious pain. It doesn't seem to help the broken sleep though. I plan on moving his crib into our room, in hopes a firmer sleep surface and extra space may help. I really dont know how to fix this or help him. If i let him cry and fuss (Ferber method) he gets so upset he kicks his face smashed into the bassinet mesh and his neck is uncomfortably bent backwards. I am afraid he will suffocate himself or hurt his neck. He also tries to turn onto his side/stomach, which frustrates him when he cant get onto his side/belly or i try to readjust him.  I think i gave all the pertinent information; If i left anything out, I'll elaborate in the comments.  Please help me; He is sucking the life out of me. I am exhausted.",

    "title": "My husband is not interested in being more gentle and understanding with our 7yr old son",
    "self_text": "Does anyone have a partner not on board with taking a gentle approach with parenting?  I have continually been faced with this contention from my husband. He is a part of the not giving a child a reason for a no, the whole \"because I said so\" group. He thinks I am wasting my breath by explaining things to our 7yr old son. I am getting this whole attitude from my husband that I am saying he's just wrong. ( all I said is our son is displaying symptoms of anxiety and to consider that maybe this is the reason he doesn't want to go to school)I've told him a few times what to do with our son to help him with different things, one instance I had to leave for work and our son needed to finish a task. I told my husband he would not want to do it, but to lead him to the task and talk him through it. I said he will whine, he might cry, but just  be there with him and give him encouragement and then let him have breaks.  I came home and found out my husband just did it himself. He missed an important teaching opportunity.  My son missed out on learning that his father is someone he can lean on and depend on for emotional support,  his father missed out on bonding with his son. I wanted our son to learn that if he makes a mess, he needs to clean it up. I also wanted him to learn that his parents are there to give him support and unconditional love no matter what he does. My husband thinks this is a waste of time. I have learned a lot about both of  my sons and have come up with a few ways to help them understand each other(they are both autistic). It is a process,  but with emotional validation given to both boys(my other son is 15) from even just myself, they behave better for me. I've  learned more about them from our conversations with each boy, separately, and now it is becoming easier to talk them down from from fighting.  I sat each boy down separately and explained that because of being autistic,  and I included myself as an example, we each have a timer and it is set for different things. Sometimes it has more time, sometimes it has less time. It just depends on how you are feeling that day. I gave an example to my younger son of how his brother's timer is up after he has been in the store for a little too long, and how he just needs some alone time in his room to recharge his timer and he will be ready to hang out some more soon. And that has defused many situations between them. It has also helped my little one understand himself and autism better. I may be wrong, but it just seems that this understanding has helped their bond. I worry about that because the little boy is 7 and older boy is 15.  But , I am quite lost on how to get through to my husband that this way is teaching them self discipline and empathy and it's a process.  Just because I explain something once to younger boy, doesn't mean I won't explain it again. ( he doesn't want to take melatonin, so I was trying to explain to him how his body doesn't make enough, and how he needs it so his brain knows it's time to sleep, I had to do it 2 nights in a row, then it occurred to me to offer the gummy version,, because he is fighting the liquid, he said yes to the offer so hopefully, no more fighting)Maybe even several times, it also doesn't mean he doesn't understand, it just means he's a child and he's learning. Children are just built to test boundaries,  they are going to test patience and I honestly lose my patience with my husband more than with my children. Any advice is appreciated and I just began changing how I parent about 7 weeks ago. I see the improvements,  and my husband sees none. My husbands version of parenting is to tell him to do something,  7 yr old cries, husband gets mad, then tells me he won't do x,y,z, and I ask how did he help him, and I find out he either told him to do something he doesn't know how to do, and then doesn't attempt to teach him...or doesn't recognize something might be wrong in a situation.  Like recognizing signs of anxiety,  then telling me I'm wrong and he's having \"mommy withdrawal\" which he doesn't really show signs of. This kid does not follow me around, is not clingy at all, and acts like business as usual when I'm home.....any advice is appreciated  Oh, I'd like to add the 7yr old is overweight, having medical problems from the weight including high blood pressure and my son has been very receptive to food changes and my explanations of how some foods are not good for a growing body and are \"sometimes\" food. And how other foods are really super good for a growing body, and how healthy foods can taste really good. I take him with me to the grocery and I let him pick out his healthy snacks, I let him pick anything new he wants to try...I do my absolute best to make this fun and exciting,  I even tell him we are going on a food adventure and then go to a grocery store that he's never been to the next town over. I even have cook books full of healthy recipes and I let him pick out whatever he wants to try and he even asks to help cook it.  But, then, I get sabotaged by the husband that can't say no but then gets mad at child for being spoiled and calls him a brat and complains about how much money he spent on him. So, I really feel he's not really even parenting. He takes him to the gas station for chips and soda after school, takes him for fast food....and this was after the healthy food discussion and how the Dr wants him to lose some weight, she's very concerned about all the effects this weight is having( he didn't always have a weight issue) but, yet, my husband continues to not say no, but yet gets mad at the child or blames me. I'm so tired of trying to explain to my husband our child isn't being a brat or a bad kid, he's actually very good and well behaved, and then he has those  testing moments, but all children do, and then there are time he's just being a child....I want to do better,  I want to correct the past mistakes I have made with my older 2 (19,15).",

I don't have an issue with this, I love that my girls have friends who do this. I love being the house the kids all go to but it's weird to me and I'm not sure I'd be comfortable if it were reversed. My kids aren't allowed into homes without my knowledge.  This was how it was when I was a kid. Playdates were arranged and my parents needed to know where I was and who I was with at all times.  We recently moved here and we moved out of a really bad neighborhood. So I'm easing into feeling comfortable letting my girls play around the neighborhood. At this time I can't imagine them walking into other people's homes without my knowledge.   My oldest is on the spectrum, she has a hard time understanding certain situations and my youngest is only 7. Sometimes I feel like I'm being too strict.  Am I being too overprotective?  Edit to add  I wrote this in the comments but feel it may be worth mentioning in the post.   I do know a lot of my neighbors and I've met a few more after their kids have been over a few times. It's a small neighborhood with a very small school. I volunteer at the school a lot and have met most people, but nothing has ever been pre-arranged and I don't have contact information for most of the parents. I'll definitely  be more vigilant about getting this information from the kids.   It feels like a lot of the parents here are okay with their kids doing this. I guess that's why I'm wondering if I'm really the odd one out and being too strict.",

    "self_text": "Hi. I'm a first time poster.   I (37f)have one autistic child (9m) that loves to tell me things he saw that has happened in tv shows, movies and video games. Even before I have the chance to watch or play them for the first time.  I'm very frustrated about it since I've asked him many times to NOT tell me anything because I want to see it for myself if he has seen it before me. To no avail he does it anyway. Mainly because I think he forgets. He even does it while we are watching and I hate it.   I don't think me doing it to him will have the same effect because he will get excited regardless.   This upcoming Friday for those who love Pokemon, Scarlet and Violet is coming out and I have pre-ordered both games. (I grew up playing since Red and Blue) Violet for him and Scarlet for me. My plan was to give him Violet for Christmas but as release day comes closer, I'm having second thoughts and debated whether to give it to him on release day as an early present JUST to avoid spoilers.  So here I am for judgement and advice on what to do. There has to be a better way to deal with his revealing spoilers problem because I do not want to turn into raging scream machine because my kiddo's forgetfulness and eagerness to share his joy when he sees something cool.   To be clear, if it's something I'm not interested in particular then I'll let him talk all about it.  Edit: you're both right. I'm being stupid. My anxiety of release day was getting to me. I like it when we play and watch stuff together. So I need learn how handle it better.",

I feel like we've tried everything we can think of and she just keeps waking up ridiculously early (4:30am early).  Her ideal bedtime is 7:30-8 because we wake up by 6 to get ready in the mornings. Although, she could actually sleep later than that cause she doesn't leave for school till 8:30. But, she almost never actually makes it to that late in the evenings. By 6:30, she's either falling asleep in the living room or having massive meltdowns over everything because she's tired. But when she goes to bed that early, she inevitably wakes up really early too.  We have a bedtime routine that we do every night, though we adjust it a little if she's really tired.  On the mornings she wakes up really early, she tries to go back to sleep, but never seems to be able to. So she either wakes my husband or I up to ask something, or she's just up in her room until the rest of us get up. This wouldn't be an issue except for the resulting exhaustion at school and in the evenings causing major drama.  Does anyone have any advice on ways to help her get more sleep?",

My boy wakes up around 1-3 AM every night, goes to the bathroom, then crawls in bed with me. I am a heavy sleeper, so unless I stay up late enough to witness it, I don’t know he’s there until I wake up. How can I get him to stay in bed all night? I’m tired of my dog waking me to go out at 4 or 5 AM, it wakes up my son too, but he doesn’t go back to bed. He gets woken by it too and, stays up much too early. The girl stays in her room no problem, and often needs woken up when it’s time to get ready for school 6:30ish. Please help me keep my son in his room throughout the night.",

    "self_text": "Hi dear parents! 👋  I have a question about celebrating birthdays at school (and daycares).   Are there any alternatives to the regular birthday bags the kids bring home from school?   The bags are plastic - not sustainable and not reusable.  The toys are made of cheap plastic that breaks immediately and ends up in the trash.  There aren't many options for candy I can buy in bulk for an entire class.    At the end of this month, I'll need to make birthday bags of my own for 27 five-year-old kids. I'm looking to do something different.    A little birthday box kids can keep reusing and playing with.  A small box with colorful pencils.  A little coloring book  Developmental puzzles or little games   Stickers with alphabet and numbers  Fidget toys   I have an entire box of stuff my kid brings home from school. Pencils, erasers, mini bubbles, stamps - a lot of things he never uses. These items might be cheap, but they are also useless. In the past, I just went to amazon and got whatever they sold in bulk, but I wish there was an alternative.   I've been thinking about making a nicer birthday bag/box option for parents like me - but before I do it, I wanted to check if I missed something. Maybe someone already does that.   Please share any ideas you have about this. Thank you ☺️",

    "self_text": "So, we became a family about two years ago. My parents and the parents of my wife are visiting their grandson only 2-3 times a year. The car ride is under two hours. It is always expected that we have to visit them. Even though our two year old son hates (!) car rides and it's always such an effort to travel for us: Packing all the things for us + the little one + our dog. Not to mention it's almost 30€ for gas... And while we are visiting them, noone seems to care and wants to spend time with our little one. PS: The grandparents are between 60-65 years old and still working (just like us).  Still we visit the grandparents about 10-15 times a year. When we don't do that, the grandparents still don't come to visit us. It would be such a bless having someone to come over like once or twice a month for a quick babysit. We don't have anyone. My parents had both their parents very close (~10 min drive) and therefore a huge advantage in my eyes. But they seem to think having a child without support is easy.  Plus I think the grandparents should put some effort into building a connection to their grandson...  What is your opinion on this? Am I wrong to expect more visits with a two hour drive? Maybe even being visited more than we go for a visit?",

    "self_text": "I just recently told my fiance that Id like to practice positive body language and I want to ask his family members to refrain from making comments about my 3 year old daughters weight. She is definitely the grandchild who gets more comments about her body. My niece is tall and skinny. My daughter has always been (since she was born) in the 95th percentile for her weight. She is incredibly active and her pediatrician has never once been concerned. I wont lie - The comments do bother me. They’ve made comments about how she doesn’t have “the skinny jeans body type” and they compare her weight to her 4 year old cousins. They weigh the same but everyone always asks and says “You must weigh more than (cousin) now”. I just don’t think its necessary. Her dad thinks Im only doing this for me because it bothers me (which it does) but Im doing it because as a girl these comments could potentially seriously negatively effect her as she gets older. He thinks we shouldn’t shelter her and that theres nothing wrong with harmless joking. If we shelter her any comments will be a shock and hurt her more….   I don’t really understand his reasoning and why he doesn’t want to support me on this so I guess thats my question? Am I sheltering her asking people not to make comments? I feel he just doesn’t understand how girls internalize comments and what others consider jokes - she may not.",

    "self_text": "So i normally wouldnt even think about it, but within the past 2 days i've gotten maybe 4 hours of sleep. My daughter (7mo) is usually a great sleeper. I rarely have problems with her, but lately i havent been and I'm guessing it's due to the time change. She falls asleep around 12 am or 1 am, and then sleeps until 3:05am. Then she's awake and i'm havijg to hold her just so she'll stay asleep. I absolutely detest the idea of sharing my bed with her because my boyfriend and i are such heavy sleepers, im afraid we'll suffocate her in her sleep.   Normally the sleep wouldnt be an issue because my 5 year old is in school and i can nap after i drop her off while the baby is still sleeping, however over the weekend that's not possible. 5 year old wakes up at 7:00am which is about half an hour after the baby finally lets me put her down while asleep. 5 year old comes barging in just as im falling asleep asking for everything under the sun (i already have her breakfast out and ready in the kitchen) and wakes her sister up and then we're just exhausted all day.   Well i have to get up at 7:00am to get 5 year old ready for school. It is almost 1 am and i can barely stay awake waiting for the baby to go to sleep.   If she wakes up again like she has been would it be bad to put her in her swing for just a few hours and let her sleep in there? (3-4 hours) im terrified that i might  fall asleep while trying to put her back to bed tonight and i dont wanna drop her or her suffocate so i feel like the swing wouldnt be a bad idea because it wouldnt be all night, just for a few hours.  EDIT: i have never let her sleep in her swing over night but she does sometimes take her naps in there, but i am always awake when she does. This would also only be a one time thing because i dont think i can go 3 nights with no sleep and if i have to take a nap when i get home from dropping myb5 year old off at school im afraid i'll sleep through my alarm.",

She’s had screen time completely wiped out this last week, toys have been taken, time outs feel like it takes up our entire day, and it just feels like it’s getting worse.  The biting is especially new and just started today. As I’m writing this, she bit me really really hard about 20 minutes ago and there’s STILL a mark!  She doesn’t get spanked, she doesn’t even get yelled at, nothing. So WHY she thinks it’s ok to do to me is beyond me.

They spend a week with us, and a week with his ex-wife.  The kids share the same room. The older one sleeps like a baby, while the younger one needs me or his dad to accompany him every single night, and would wail/cry whenever bf takes a firm stance and refuses, which results in dad coming over anyway. Sometimes he knocks on our door at odd hours (1AM, 3AM, you get it). Bf tries his best to not have me do it because he assures that it's his responsibility, but I help out sometimes.  My bf has been sick for a few days and couldn't move, and tried to explain to the younger child (let's call him Sam) that he's not well and can't be around him too much to lower the risk of spreading, plus he could barely move.  Last night he firmly set his boundary with Sam before heading to bed, telling him that he can't expect to be accompanied every night and told him to go to bed. At 2AM, Sam starts wailing, bf goes over, and comes back to me after he's asleep, but alas Sam comes knocking again after 30 minutes. Unfortunately due to his unwell state, he raised his voice at his son and told him off, and Sam went to bed quietly crying.   I voiced my frustration at my bf, telling him that we need to find a way to deal with this, and coddling nor yelling at him was not the way. My bf started crying, saying that one of the reasons his marriage failed was because him and his ex-wife could not sleep together since Sam was born, and that put a strain.   I went back to Sam after reading some articles at 2AM+ in the morning, found him silently crying as well. I told him straight up that sleeping alone can be scary, and he will be scared, but we need to work together so he can train himself to sleep. I know he's sad to see his dad sad as well. I told him I'll be back in one minute to check on him but will not lay in bed with him, and pinky promised. I did as I said, and came back, promising to come back again in 5 minutes, planning to extend the time as we went. He fell asleep after the 3rd check up.   I know I'm not a his parent, but I do need some help/tips on how to handle this situation. It breaks my heart to see both my bf and Sam in this situation, and would like to help out.",

My daycare provider insinuates that he’s going because of his “bad behavior“.   I have 2 older girls. So my boy is the youngest of three, if birth order matters.  For his behavior: he has pushed other kids down, usually smaller kids. He will slap my daycare providers butt 🙄, super not proud of that. When he gets mad he sticks his tongue out and spits. He has kicked a kid on the playground. This happened at daycare.   He does the spitting thing at home, and he has hit his sister before, but usually when they are cooped up.   Developmentally, he is hitting milestones for a 4yo. He can read and spell his own name, talk in full sentences back and forth. We had him tested and no issues.  At daycare they don’t go outside a lot. He’s like a puppy that needs a ton of exercise. When he’s tired, those behaviors don’t happen, he’s more mellow.   I think my daycare provider has pegged him as a bad kid from the start and is making a self-fulfilling prophecy. Or, I am burying my head in the sand on his behavior.   I’d love an opinion on this.

    "title": "Help me help my anxious child",
    "self_text": "TLDR: Daughter is super anxious at kindergarten with about 70% separation anxiety and 30% social anxiety. Help.  Daughter is 5 and started kindergarten in September.  For context. We are in Slovenia. Kindergarten is what we call the childcare situation before the child starts school at 6 years old. It is (mostly) government run and not obligatory. There is no formal education but there is some preparation for school in terms of sitting still and paying attention for about 30 minutes at a time and various fine motor drawing exercises to prepare them for learning to write in school. The rest is loads of play and going outside on walks and to playgrounds. Daughter's class is calm (or as calm as it gets with that many kids) but quite big with 24 children. They rotate through 3 caregivers with 2 of them always being present. She is there for 8.5 hours from 6:30 am to 3 pm.  After I finished my maternity leave daughter was looked after by my parents or by husband and me during the lockdowns and then exclusively by me when I was on maternity leave for her brother. She had very little contact with other children.  Daughter gets anxious at drop-off. She complains her stomach hurts and she often cries. She tries to bargain to not go to kindergarten (Will you take me to grandma and grandpa only for today and I'll go to kindergarten for the rest of the week without crying)  She will be anxious all throughout the day. She will sometimes start crying during activities and sometimes she even likes to go to a mat on the floor away from all the other children and she tells the caregiver that she would like to be alone for a little while. She is fine if the activities are new and exciting. The caregivers try their best to notice before she starts crying and to prevent it by distracting her but she isn't loud and disruptive when she cries and sometimes the other children have to alert the caregivers because she will be completely silent with tears and snot running down her face. She otherwise does well with the activities and she participates nicely. She will however not initiate play and waits for the caregivers to tell her what to do even when it's time for free play. (She has no issues with this at home)  When we pick her up she always says things were awesome and it takes a lot of prodding for her to tell the truth. I think she's worried about disappointing us by not liking kindergarten.  The anxiety then spills over to the times she's not at kindergarten starting with restraint collapse in the car ride home and a couple of big tantrums on the weekends especially on Saturday but calming down a bit on Sunday. The cycle starts up again on Sunday evenings when she realises she'll have to go to kindergarten the next day. Sometimes she cries.  She says she cries when the activities are boring and she has time to remembers how much she misses us. She is also bothered by how loud the children are and the general chaos. She doesn't interact with the kids but is okay with the caregivers. She is generally better with connecting to adults and older children but not children her own age. I think she'd do better if she connected with the other children more but since she's getting overwhelmed that's obviously not happening. I'm working on organizing some playdates for her but we don't really have a culture of that here and also I'm a bit introverted so it's going slower than I'd like. We're also practicing some breathing exercises when she gets upset at home and we are trying to encourage her to do them when she gets anxious at kindergarten.  How do I help daughter with her anxiety. What are some good strategies? Any good books or websites on the topic? Everything I find just talks about how to recognize anxiety but not how to actually manage it.",

He goes to a school outside of our neighborhood because they have a good gifted program. He spends all day in the gifted classroom other than lunch and gym and band. He used to play sports but wanted to focus on other interest this year. He started Lego robotics, math team, and drama club. He has made some friends but has had issues with some of the boys.  They call him names (gay slurs) and make fun of him for being in the gifted class. He mostly keeps his head down and moves forward but I feel so bad. We have brought it to the schools attention and they discipline the boys but it doesn't stop anything. The boys deny a lot of it and it is their word against my sons. I feel so bad for him and wish there was more I could do. My son says it doesn't really matter and he can keep ignoring them. I am hoping it gets better in high school but he still has to get to June. What worked for your boys?  Edit: For some reason people are assuming the gifted program is just some club for smart kids. It is not. It is a twice exceptional classroom for kids who are highly gifted with a disability. All of the kids in the class have a disability and there is a special education teacher in the classroom. This is not a fun program. It is a program he needs. Gen ed was not for him. He developed anxiety and was refusing to go to school before the gifted program.  Edit: You guys can stop suggesting kiddie fight clubs. He is not being physically assaulted.",

    "self_text": "I’m 13 weeks pp. I had a C-section and delivered our beautiful baby girl. It feels like my fiancé and I are drifting apart since then.  Our girl is a contact sleeper. I’m working really hard with sleep associations as well as other things even though she’s still so young. Then hopefully with repetition she will feel secure enough to sleep in her crib or bassinet. I’ve only managed to get half an hour nap for her about three times. Because of this, my fiancé and I split the night into shifts. I get my sleep time from 7-1, but often only get 2-4 hours of sleep. Then fiancé sleeps from 2-8. So we are sleeping alone. We don’t cuddle as my daughter normally wants to eat or is in the process of getting put to sleep. If she didn’t need these things at that time, we said we would bring her into our room to cuddle but that hasn’t happened yet.   We have bottles and pacifiers to wash, a dog to care for, food to make, formula to mix etc which leaves one person to do all that and one to sit with our daughter since now she has a hard time sleeping in daylight whereas before 12 weeks we could baby wear and do things. After getting the things done that we need just to get through day to day (ignoring the “extra” tasks), we only have about half an hour together per day.  Sometimes we don’t even have that. Weekends aren’t much better because of grocery shopping, Bath day, trimming dogs nails, extra work and time with the dog since he’s still feeling a bit out of place, etc.  We haven’t been getting along as well. We don’t laugh even a quarter as much as before (but how can we when we hardly see each other). When I ask him to follow through with the bed time routine he always says he forgets (he forgets about 3/4 of the time and I feel it’s defeating my hard work). It’s just reading her a story in her glider (one story or until she no longer looks at the pages, whatever’s first), kissing her cheek, saying “good night. I love you,” And then cradling her with a pacifier while we rock her. I even said he can just hold up something colourful and read his book to her as it’s more about the bonding and language development. He’s stressed at work on top of it. So when we have conversations he’s either debating whatever I just said, his tone is snippy, or he says he didn’t hear me when I talk to him about it.   Last night I tried to engage in conversation that had nothing to do with the baby over dinner in our daughters nursery as I rocked her to sleep, but his responses were short and he was glued to his book. I even tried asking about his book but that didn’t work either, so I gave up. Later I told him I was angry we had that time and he spent it reading. He apologized. Tonight he didn’t even join me. He ate in a different room. Don’t know why; that’s a discussion for tomorrow.   I’ve talked to him about ppd and if he thinks he has it. I stated that if it’s ppd we can help him because I want to do this together. Said he’s helped me with my mental health issues so I wanted to be there to help him as well because I love him. He insisted it isn’t but would let me know if it was or if he started to question it so I dropped it.   My support system is nonexistent (posted about it yesterday) and cannot ask someone to come watch her while we go out or anything.   I know they say “fourth trimester” but aren’t we past that? And will things improve or is this the beginning of the end? Am I being too sensitive/dramatic? It’s just hard going from pre- baby couple and him feeding me apple slices as I fed our daughter and was hungry to this.   I just feel like I’m alone and slowly disappearing. That I’m slowly sinking and no one (adult) notices. That no one will reach out their hand.  Thanks for reading if you got this far.",

    "self_text": "I have an 8 year old daughter. She frequently becomes very fixated on organizing events to do with her peers. The last time it was \"the show.\" It was basically a play she wanted to put on based on a TV show that she was watching. She talked about it for months, was always telling people at school to practice for it, always trying to get her sister to help work on it, trying to get me to organize with parents. The problem is none of the other kids care about this nearly as much as her and after about 6 months of talking about \"the show\" it just sort of never materialized and she moved on. Now we're on to something similar, \"the video.\" She's trying to recruit kids from across the school to reenact a music video. She's holding some sort of auditions, asking people to work on \"sets,\" etc. But in reality I'm pretty sure these kids are like \"yeah, sounds cool, sure,\" but aren't actually devoting much if any time to this outside of when she is talking to them about it. However, these things will completely absorb my daughter's downtime. She'll talk about it and plan for it incessantly.   I'm not really sure what to do about it. She's been asking me to reach out to all of these parents and I have been telling her no. I told her that they need to organize everything at school and if they finally decide that they are ready and want to do this, then let me know. I don't want to be unsupportive, but I also don't want her let down by the fact that no one is as interested in this as her. I'm pretty sure this is the case because no other parents have ever reached out to me at the urging of their kids, whereas I did this a few times the first time around for \"the show.\"  Any suggestions? Im not trying to be a wet blanket, but I'm also trying to help her manage her expectations. She has a very hard time making friends, so I assume something like this is an attempt to connect with people. However, I suspect it may do the opposite when she's always taking these things very seriously and pressuring her peers.",

I always sit or kneel on the floor by the bathtub when I bathe her, but she's getting quick and will scoot away from me and try to launch herself out of the tub while laughing. I have a bad back and can't move as quickly as I used to.   I used to love bathing her, but should my partner take over this task? Is there any way to reason with a baby, or redirect her?

    "self_text": "Hi all,  My 8yo takes the bus to school. Just recently the bus schedule changed, and he now gets picked up 20 minutes later than usual (7:55 rather than 7:30). The bus stop is probably 50 feet from our house.  I work nights, so when I get home at 7 I go right to bed usually. My wife works, and has to get out of the house by as close to 7:30 as she can get. So typically in mornings my wife would get my 8yo to the bus stop, then drive my 6yo to school, then go to work.  Now that the route has changed, she's suddenly feeling comfortable leaving him to wait at the bus stop alone. We tried a trial run of it last week where I stayed up and made sure he got on the bus ok, and now this coming week she wants to do it for real. Here's my problem.  First, I'm not sure he is ready for that kind of responsibility. He's not allowed to have a phone at school, so I can't just give him a cheap cell, so if he has a problem he's expected to come back in and get me.   Second, there's another parent of a similar aged kid at the bus stop. Our kid goes to hang out with theirs until the bus comes. I don't want to offload parenting duties onto her; my kid will do whatever is most convenient, he will absolutely ask her instead of coming all the way inside. I can have a talk with him about this but I'm not sure it will come to anything.  So there we have it. My wife is adamant that it's fine, he can be there by himself, he's old enough and we're close by, and other 8yos do it without issue. You've heard my side. What do you think? Terrible idea or am I being too controlling?",

I’m the working parent and I want to make sure I’m not being the jerk in this one. Because I know staying at home with the kids is really hard.   Background: 2 kids under 6, none infants. Stay at home parent also does online school with the oldest, usually taking up a few hours. Working parent has a stressful job where I get yelled at many times a day and generally disrespected. Work 8-5.   It all just kind of boiled over this weekend. Stay at home parent said I snack too much (aka I’m fat) and just said they didn’t mean to say it (not that they didn’t mean it). Also said I’m whiny (I was sick and had a fever). Then today it snowed. And we have a driveway on a hill. I slipped going down it to leave and asked them if they would mind making sure it was ok when I got home. I asked before I left work and they said it melted and was clear. But clearly it was all still snow, just my tracks were ice and I slipped and almost didn’t make it up the hill (scary). Zero apology. I am just sick of not feeling like the stay at home parent gives a flying hoot about anything related to me. They also never apologize. I don’t think I’ve heard a sorry more than once a year and I always end up apologizing and feeling like a jerk wad.   Also - this is helping to just type it out. So thank you for listening if you got this far.",

    "self_text": "So lately my son (35mos) has been having full meltdowns when I pick him up from his mom's. We split the week with me having him Monday thru Thurs, and her the remainder of the week. I work from home so during the day he hangs out with me and my other son (24mos). Typically we play with their toys and hangout and watch the movies they like. they also get outside time playing and going for walks. I don't spank my son or abuse him in any way, in fact I keep finding myself letting some negative behavior slide because I want him to like being with me. Normally if he acts out bad enough or hits his brother I usually put him in time out. Despite this lately when he gets pick up he runs out the door happy to leave, and when I go to pick him up he has full on meltdowns saying he doesn't want to go to daddy's house. It's a battle getting him in the car with me, and it usually ends with his mom or stepdad having to bribe him in some way, however oddly enough within 5 minutes of leaving he's totally fine and peacefully chitchatting with me in the car. Outside of my other son I also have two older children (16f, 14m) that are here full time, and another (13f) who is here every other week. Everyone including my partner treats him kindly and enjoy spending time with him. I assume he just likes mom's house more and is experiencing separation anxiety, but it's really taking a toll on me watching him breakdown. Any advice anyone can give I'd appreciate.",

Another thing that’s similar and annoying when they ask for her size and i tell them and then they say no she needs a bigger size and buys her a few sizes up. Like why now she can’t use that clothes for another few years. Makes no sense to me.",

When I tried putting her down for a nap she crys or will wake up 10 mins later. The only time she gets a good nap in is in her swing or when it's time to sleep for the night she is bundled up in her swaddle. She does sometimes cosleep with us with no swaddled even then we have to swaddle her first then take it off when she is in a deep sleep before we sleep for the night. Any tips for us?

    "self_text": "My LO just turned two. She doesn't talk much yet (she uses signs and has some words, but she's not to the point of being able to speak up for herself)  She is VERY complicate. When playing with other kids she shares willingly, but also when a kid takes something from her she doesn't complain. She'll either watch the kid play with it, or walk away and play with something else.  I'm never sure how much I should intervene. Because on one hand I'm happy she's sharing well, on the other,  I don't want her being taken advantage of.. (something I didn't really think was possible in her peer group. But after witnessing some really aggressive toddlers who seem to only want what she has...it makes me wonder)   Last night we went trick or treating with one of her little friends. She had a costume with several parts including a hand held accessory. Her friend wanted it, and at first I was encouraging her to share, and pass it back and forth. But every time it was my daughters turn the friend would throw a huge fit. And because my daughter didn't cry when giving it up the other mom asked if her daughter could just keep it the entire time, since mine wasn't the one crying.  😕  And while I had no reason to object, it kinda broke my heart that here she was missing a piece of her costume (that I hand made!, And it kinda tied it all together)  Simply because she didn't throw a fit about sharing.. She was still eager to have her turn.  But she didn't fuss when she didn't get it back...  UGHH.  I just never expected an adult to take advantage of her being so agreeable too!!   Going forward how should I handle this??  Especially when there isn't another adult present (most encourage sharing or will reprimand their child for taking from her).",

She normally goes down peacefully, so when I saw she isn't gonna calm down or sleep I took her out of the crib, I tried again after like 40 minutes, but it didn't work out. On the second day the same thing happened, and I felt cold sweat realizing what was happening, no please just a couple more months! I'm not ready to give up my mental and physical break! I guess I have no say in it, I just accepted that's how it's gonna be now!  What I cannot make peace with, is her refusing to nap at all at the weekend! She screamed and cried once she saw the sleeping bag and realized I'm putting her to sleep!   Friday she totally refused to sleep! Despite her being obviously tired, rubbing her eyes and sucking her thumb!  Huppy hugged her cause she was cranky and whinnying and she fell asleep in his arms! We put her down and sneak out, she is up in 20 minutes crying! At night time she also wouldn't go to sleep, I set the timer on 10 minutes and let her yell at us through the monitor, but she falls asleep before the timer goes off. Saturday the same happened again with her nap, I let her cry for exactly 9 minutes before she fell asleep for 45 minutes and woke up yelling (note that she normally sleeps for at least 90 minutes and I have to wake her up) Today my hubby went to work from the office, she went down with a smile and no fights! It's been almost two hours! What is going on? Is it possible she misses her dad and didn't want to sleep to stay and play with him? She usually sees him for 2 hours during workdays, and he works from home for 2 days ,but he is mostly busy with working and doesn't really spend quality time with her. Is this about him being home and available to play with her or is it just a coincidence? And it's something else like a growth spurt?  All the time I put her down she is clean and fed and has already played with us for a ton of time , also I know she is not sick as we have just been at her pediatrician this week and she shows no signs of discomfort during the day.",

I was awakened by the earsplitting scream from her room. It didn't take me long to get to her and when i did and i wrapped her in my arms, she was shaking like a leaf and sniffling. Her little heart was racing and all she kept saying was, \"my daddy, my daddy\". my ex husband looked at me and I asked her did she have a nightmare and all she said was yeah and sniffled again laying on my shoulder. He went back to his room while, I held her for a few minutes until she was ready to go back to her room.   It's those moments in parenting that i cherish. The moments where i have the opportunity to love on my baby and tell her i love her and she implicitly knows it. I'm sad that her father and me got divorced because that means it's a matter of time before i won't always be there to hug and hold her and sing to her when this happens again.",

    "title": "Please rate the \"normality\" of my 6-year-old's behavior.",
    "self_text": "My six-year-old daughter is the oldest of three (6f, 4f, 2f). She’s been challenging since her sister was born (when she was 1.5 yo), but I really feel like we’re parenting to the best of our abilities. We took her to a therapist a little over a year ago and the diagnosis was, “eh, she’s not outside the realm of normal, keep doing what you are doing.” She has two traits that make life difficult for her: She is inflexible (my way or the highway!) and she is a perfectionist (she can flip-out when she makes a mistake, does not want to speak up at school for fear of being wrong, and is overly critical of her younger sisters if they make a mistake).  Her challenging behavior is almost entirely when she is around her siblings. She is not challenging at school (we’ve asked her teachers) and she’s usually great one-on-one. She also has social anxiety, so I think some of her challenging behavior at home may stem from her “keeping it together” at school and then kind of venting on her brothers. I expect, for example, for there to be a lot of emotional explosions after a birthday party.  In any case, her inflexibility and aversion to mistakes has led to a number of incidences. She reacts strongly and emotionally. For example, she might grab a toy away from her sister that is playing not the way she wants and throw the toy, sometimes breaking it, then cry and yell and be angry that the toy broken. She might angrily rip up a drawing she worked hard on if she made a small mistake, and then sob about having ripped it up. An example of her not putting up with others’ mistakes is that she will angrily yell at her sisters if they pronounce something wrong. This morning it was, “It’s PANcake, not PINcake!!! Mom, 4f said PINcake!!”   She knows when she is making bad choices, but sometimes she does what my husband and I call, “doubling down”. Like , she already made a poor choice by throwing her toy, so now she's going to go jump on the couch or some other attention seeking behavior. (The “doubling down” is particularly annoying.)  Generally, she has some kind of behavior that ends in tears, yelling, stomping, etc 2 or 3 times per week. Each instance can be just 5 or 10 minutes to an hour or so. The “doubling down” is less frequent, maybe a couple times per month.  So, my questions is: One a scale of 1 to 10, how (ab)normal is this? Lets say:  1 = totally normal; 3 = hmm, I've seen this type of thing many times before, check in with your pediatrician at the next appointment; 5 = read some recommended books, see therapist; 7 = sounds pretty extreme, get thee to a child psychologist asap; 10 = this is abuse and your family won’t recover from this kid.",

    "self_text": "Context: We have a 4-year-old and live far away from any family (11-hour drive at least), so my kid rarely gets to see them. My husband is deploying next year and won't be able to visit family for quite a while, so he really wants to drive up this year. He offered to take our daughter and go alone, but would really like me to come.  We did go there for Christmas last year and have done lots of holidays with them - much more than with my family.   Why I don't want to go:   I work remotely and the internet connection where we would be staying is terrible, so I'd need to be really creative about where to work.   I have limited PTO and don't want to use too much of it hanging out with people I like but don't really enjoy spending time with. I also need to save as much PTO as possible for when my husband is gone.   My inlaws love to get together and eat and drink all day, which I absolutely hate (like some is fine, but not exclusively). I always feel incredibly claustrophobic there, especially in winter.   There is ALWAYS some giant blow-out at some point when everyone gets too trashed.   IMO, holidays are just a day and I'm fine celebrating afterwards with my immediate family.   But the biggest reason (and why I think I'm being somewhat selfish) is that it's hugely inconvenient to get up there and I won't have a good time (I have tried so hard to be a good sport in the past, but just never have that great of a time no matter what). I feel like I should maybe bite the bullet for my husband's sake. He can go with just our daughter, but it would obviously be a giant pain for him.

    "self_text": "Any advice would be much appreciated.  I have a lot of things going on. So, if you are able to offer any kind of advice regarding ANY of these scenarios, please feel free to contribute. Any sort of advice helps!   My husband and I have never really had the best marriage. I’ve really tried my best but a long time ago, he had an affair at the beginning of our marriage, and I feel that it’s always been a struggle since then. While we went to many years of marriage counseling, it just was always a bad memory that I held on to in my mind. Other than that, he is a great husband by doing things for me and he is an amazing father to our young children. He just shows no emotional attachment to me and is literally always in a bad mood.   We bought a house in a place I ended up hating. We sold the house and made nothing on it. We had no money whatsoever and so we had to move in with his parents. I assumed this would be a temporary thing but it has ended up being longer than I had expected. Husband won’t move out. He said that we need to stay with his parents for a minimum of 12-18 months to save some money. I get that we have no money. But I never would have sold our house if I knew we would have to live with them for this long. I have a terrible relationship with my own parents (mother specifically) and I haven’t spoken to them in months. I have not spoken to any of my family members (siblings included) as they are the most non-supportive, critical people I have ever met. I have so much going on in my life and I just couldn’t handle the stress of defending myself to them anymore. So I took a very long, much needed break from them all.   That being said, I have never had a good relationship with my mother-in-law either since the day I had met her. She never liked me. No matter what I did, it was never acknowledged or appreciated and I was told numerous times that I should stop trying to have a relationship with her. The situation with her is different than it is with my own mother - don’t get it twisted. My mother is in a category of her own and I have legitimate reasons for cutting her off. However, I have tried so hard to have the relationship I have yearned for with my own mother, with my MIL, and she clearly wants nothing to do with me. It’s been extremely awkward and uncomfortable living in a small house with these dynamics. My husband doesn’t care about my feelings on it because he said we have no other place to live and our kids need a roof over their heads. Got it. I know all of this. I don’t want to sound ungrateful and unappreciative for their help because I can’t thank them enough. I don’t have the support from my OWN family, so I am truly appreciative for the help I am receiving. I just don’t understand why my MIL feels the way she does towards me. I try to have conversations with her, I always include her in our outings, even paying for tickets to attend events so she feels included. It’s very uncomfortable for me being in the same room with her, with me trying to always start up conversations and getting one word answers on return. I have no choice but to stay here because I have no place to live. I have no money.   I guess I am just feeling very overwhelmed and I am venting on this subject because I don’t have my own mother to rely on and knowing how my MIL feels about me, just makes me feel even worse.i find it bothering me a lot when I see her on the phone with her daughter, as well as other family members, laughing and having nonchalant conversations with them. I find myself feeling jealous of their relationships, because I know that she will never want to have that with me. It will always be awkward and uncomfortable and that horrible feeling you get inside.   What does my husband say about this? He says to stop trying to force a relationship with her because he has told me numerous times that she doesn’t want that with me. He tells me to “get over it” especially now, because we have no place to live. I get what he’s saying, but it doesn’t make the bothersome feelings I have within me, go away.   Do you have any suggestions on how to deal with ANY of these current scenarios?  Thank you for helping me!",

Would I be an asshole if I politely tell them that if they can’t be at my house well before lunch to just come when their naps are done?

I understand that it’s a lot to travel and stay in a hotel, however, I don’t think it’s necessarily fair that our routine is so disrupted either.

At 9 she was diagnosed with T1 diabetes. It broke my heart when she asked how long she needed to take shots and I had to say \"forever\".  She has done so well and has just been certified as a Certified Nurse Assistant and plans on continuing on.   She lives with me.  I have been a part of all her growth. We are super close discussing everything. Periods, birth control, std, pregnancy,  etc .  I always said that she shouldn't get pregnant until she has her life straight. I still support her financially (alot).  I have been pretty open and clear if she was to get preggo I couldn't support her and she would need to live with the father.   She has told me her dream is to have children. I said no problem but get your life straight first. Especially with health benefits. (Because of diabetes and a baby.) I also told her to go back to her therapist and tell them her feelings on having a baby.  Well yesterday she hit me with I'm 5 Weeks preggo. She has in the past taken a morning after pill, just for back story.  I said you are not ready financially or emotionally for this. You need to consider an abortion and therapy for thinking multiple kids is a goal in life. I said this is my opinion as your father.  But I'm out as your checkbook. I I  I wanted to be open so she knew how i felt.  and I will of course love her and love her child but I can't help. I'm a person that is always a helper so it's hard I can't in this case. I'm financially tapped.   I love writing and this helps me get emotions out. I cried the entire time writing this which helps me get feeling out.  But I'm a mess.

I should have included that. Which is why I feel the way I do. We have spoken about this for months.  I said the time isn't right. Give it 2 years at least of job and her bf.  She has known the guy a month.  He isn't to bright either to be okay with this happening.  The rule was live with me take the pill.  She said no to my rule.  And I will add I'm heartbroken. I love her.  I wanted to cheer becoming a grandparent.  But I can't,  I just can't be happy and for that I feel guilty too.  **edit 2 finances - none. I don't know why she has this entitlement to a momey tree. I explained all my money is gone from her and her schooling.  Etc. So there is nothing, that scares me the most.  She thinks there is some hidden funds. But nothing. She will be on public assistance.   **I need to get some sleep. Thank you all so much. Each of you.

My heart is broken for her.. she said her friends won't play with her, and her grandparents look at her so concerned she says they don't love her now. She went to bed crying last night. Thank God her 1st grade teacher is a wonderful lady! She said she gets cold sores across her face like my daughter and she talks with the kids about being kind, but she says they still look at her mean can call nasty things.   Unless you have a miracle cure, idk what I'm really looking for. Idk why I'm posting this really. I'm just sad for my kid..",

    "title": "Our baby collects and holds 2-3 pacifiers at night. How to wean her off?",
    "self_text": "This is sort of a regular pacifier-weaning question, but our child [17 months] does something that I haven't heard of other kids doing—not only does she sleep with a pacifier in her mouth, but she also likes to hold 1 or 2 additional pacifiers to fall asleep. We will give her one when we put her down, but she will immediately sit up and reach out, and often will sign or say 'more.' She holds them and kind of fiddles with them to sooth herself, so it seems like she loves the pacifiers not only for the sucking reflex soothing but also as a true comfort object. She's usually pretty distraught if we try to keep it to one or even two pacifiers.  I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for a replacement comfort object (I feel like she might need something to fiddle with, not just replacing with a soft stuffed animal?), or just general advice for pacifier-weaning at this age?",

    "title": "“Support system”",
    "self_text": "I needed it today. I’ve been needing it. I’m 13 weeks pp. had my daughter via C-section. My anxiety I developed during pregnancy hasn’t gone away. I fixate on things. I pick my skin. I lose the already very limited sleep I have and average 3 hours a night. But then I have days (most of them) that are absolutely amazing and I’m on top of the world that last for a while before I start to feel uneasy again and then have like 2-3 REALLY shitty days.   My support system is very small - my friend and my mom. That’s it. My friends littles are getting sick back to back so it’s understandable she can’t come. I don’t want my babe exposed to something so early anyways. She came once to meet her in the beginning but hasn’t been available to help.   My mom on the other hand doesn’t work. She offered to make me food before my C-section to freeze, she offered to take the baby while I sleep, she’s offered to clean my house while I take care of the baby, etc. but every time I take her up on her help because I can feel I need it, she can’t make it that day despite her picking the day and time. Or she says she can only come for half an hour. But she’s notoriously late, and always leaves on time, so we are talking close to 20 mins she would maybe be here. But visits (45-90 minutes) she can make work.   The two bigger meals I asked her to make (lasagna and chilli) and she didn’t wasn’t a huge deal. We wanted two weeks of food frozen to help ease us in, but we had one week covered and put in a grocery delivery order for more frozen foods. I can’t rely on my fiancé during the day because he is working. So this support system that promised they would come to help, that they’d be here for me, hasn’t been here.   My interactions with my daughter are all the same as they are on my absolute best day. She gets nothing less and will never get less. But it makes me wonder if she can see past the goofy faces and the singing and kisses and stories and playing/talking and feel the bubbling volcano inside of me. And then after finding myself crying as I do some simple  chore such as wash bottles as my fiancé spends time with her (because I can’t do it despite baby wearing as she is incredibly sensitive to light), I go to bed where it takes me a bit to come down from the constant in my day. And then I hear my daughter crying despite being with daddy. I know she’s being cared for. She’s being fed, changed, diapered, played with, etc, but it’s hard when she’s crying and I’m supposed to be sleeping. The sleep deprivation never helps.   And the three months have been crazy too. We struggled with weight gain. Then we struggled with my breast milk. We struggled with cracked nipples. Pain so bad that I didn’t want to feed on that side and would bawl whenever I did. Then switched to pumping and struggled pumping enough. Then struggled finding a formula that my daughter was okay on. Then was triple feeding. Then watched my supply dip until I produced nothing despite doing everything I could. Then the dog ate a pacifier and had to drive an hour on my own. Etc. Just been one stressful thing after another. And I need a break. And I can’t get it.   I was unseen and unheard when I was a child. I don’t know why I was so naive to think that it’d be different since my mom had changed. I don’t want to become hyper independent again but it seriously would be less stressful than being told I’m getting help and then it falling through. It’s so disappointing. But I should’ve known better.   If you read this thank you for holding space for me. Not sure how much that made sense since yesterday I got 2.5 hours of sleep and I’ve had a bad day. But I just needed to vent a little.",

The four older kids are all in school full time and I stay home with my youngest. My husband works full time.   Currently, all of the kids go to bed around 8:30pm and 10 & 12 opt to stay awake quietly in their room for about fifteen minutes or so. I think 12 is old enough to stay up later, and my husband and I are thinking of extending their bedtime by an hour. I’m feeling conflicted because selfishly, I am so worn out by even dinnertime that I cannot wait for bedtime at 8:30. I look forward to that time alone with my husband because that’s our only time it’s just the two of us, not wrapped up in parenting/household things. I know that 12 wants to stay up and hang with us whether it’s board games or tv/movie or just talking. I feel like the worst mom for not wanting to spend more time with 12 but I go to bed by 10pm and I don’t know if I’m being completely unrealistic that I would like to have more than an hour of kid free time a night.   We’ve thought that maybe we could tell 12 that their bedtime is extended but they can use that time to be in another room doing whatever they please but then I really feel evil, like I’m shunning them. I don’t want them to feel like I h don’t like them or don’t want to spend time with them.   WWYD in this situation? Any advice is appreciated!",

Lines were kind of busy so got in the one that seemed the shortest…Well the cashier lady turned out to be very slow and it was too late to turn back since several people had gotten behind me.   Finally the cashier lady got to me and I told her it was just the gift card for me BUT she still scanned the first item of the guy behind me. I said wait a minute, I just told you that it was just the gc for me and she was like oops, you’ll just have to wait till I’m done with his stuff because I already scanned his cereal. This dude had a $100 worth of groceries in his cart 😠  I was like whatever, I had already waited this long so might as well stay there. However some random guy came up and started complaining that she had overcharged him 3 times for an item and wanted a refund. So she stops mid scan and starts engaging with him. Trying to fix her mistake.   I got fed up, slammed the card down near the bags and left. My boyfriend who had gotten some stuff at self checkout and was waiting for me with my almost 8 month old was like that was very rude of you. The thing I love most about him is that he’s not the type to easily lose his temper and is a very caring person.  I didn’t feel like what I did was wrong in that moment but then I started thinking about my daughter and what type of behavior I want to model for her. I know she is still too young to comprehend much but still felt a bit guilty as her mom for losing my cool in front of her",

I’ve been so depressed, working long/late hours and don’t see him 3 days out of the week. When he is home with me, I’m not very present, always in bed, etc. Single parent life is hard. I realize I need to make some drastic changes.  Because of this, he’s been watching an embarrassing amount of TV.  Now, he watches mostly YouTube Kids and watches video games being played or just random videos. Some are pretty educational but most are not. Very recently all he’s been talking about is these videos. He wakes up and goes straight to the tv. He’s not interested in anything else, like reading books, coloring or even going on walks outside.  Like I said, I’ve been failing him. I know.   He’s very well behaved in school and is kind, smart and a great listener. We have a strong bond and a mutually respectful relationship, in my opinion. But he’s very sensitive and has been through a heap of trauma recently, which makes me want to give him what he wants, but also makes me want to make these changes gently.  So how do I go about cutting the screen time without being the worst person ever? How do I explain to him that these videos are not good for him? How do I get him excited to do other things again?

    "self_text": "Hello everyone!  I have a big worry, that keeps me up at nights since yesterday. I have a 3 year old son, who in the last year have been frequently sick. Usually cold or some kind of infection. We always tought that it is because he brings home deseases from the nursery and pre-school, but this week he was sick again and his doctor said, that he is sick too many times, so she ordered a bloodtest. Friday the bloodtest came and the doctor said that he have very high inflammation level in his blood (60 instead of 10... i don't know what that is) and also the iron levels are low.  We also experienced, that he has his lymp nodes swollen anytime he was sick, they can be felt all around his neck every single time, so much so, that if were unsure if he is sick, we usually checked his neck. We never considered this a problem, because his cousin (a 2 year old girl) have the same lymp node problem. The nodes are not hurting him, they aren't big, they are soft and can be easily moved.  The other thing that keeps happening is night sweats. He is usually wet from every sleep (even a half hour nap), on his back and head. But this was no concern fo ours previously, because his little bother is the same, and night sweats are sometimes happening to me aswell.  My boy also started to have leg pains, in both legs, so much so, that sometimes he was limping. The problem is, that we were unsure if that is because he is very active, bruising his legs all the time by jumping on the floor, hitting things carelessly. He would limp in 1 minute and next running around again, but in the last few months there were a couple of times, when he was crying because of legpain.  He usually barely eats, we have to beg him to eat anything, and every meal seem to be about making him to eat at least a little. He is very thin for his age, and we are unsure how to get him to eat. It usually ends up with him yelling us. He usually drinks a lot though.  He is pale since the day he was born, and every doctor who ever watched him complained about his paleness.  I never put these sympthoms together (maybe I am a bad father), but searching for all of these showed me, that these are clear signs of leukemia / lynphoma and I am terrified by the thought.  My wife have spoken to the doctor about the blood test yesterday so I wasn't able to ask anything. We were given antibiotics and we will have to redo the bloodtest next friday to see if inflammation levels have dropped down or not.  So anybody with experience, do I overworry, or is it as bad as it seems?",

    "self_text": "Please tell me if I'm insane for actually considering this... my parents want to get my almost 1 year old a dog bed for Christmas.  Backstory: We're visiting my parents, and my little one is having THE BEST TIME crawling into the big dog bed with a few books and rolling around while flipping through the pages.  The bed itself is an extra cushy Serta, and my mom covers it with a new clean blanket daily. It's about 3'x2' and has a raised \"wall\" on three sides. The front is open.  After four days of fun, mom and dad want to buy little one the same dog bed for Christmas. It would go in our livingroom as a reading corner cushion. I'd likely embroider little one's name on the back and fill the bed with her plushies and small decorative pillows.   A nice dog bed is about half the cost of one of those pottery barn toddler chairs and a fourth of the cost of a Nugget, so it would be practical and cost-effective.   So again, am I crazy for thinking this might be a good idea?  *Edit: we've decided on the  $49.98 Member's Mark Sofa Pet Bed in Grey from Sam's Club. It's 34.5\"x26.5,\" the cover is water resistant and unzips completely/can go in the washing machine, it's got a layer of memory foam on top of a layer of a more firm orthopedic foam, annnnd the poufy bolstered walls are filled with an eco-friendly polyester made from recycled plastic bottles.   Big and cushy, practical, cost-effective, easy to clean, and eco-friendly.   Thank you all for the reassurance. We only have a couple of friends with kids, so having this community of parents is just the best. Thanks!",

Now comes the part I’ve never thought about, what bathroom would I take her to when I’m out in public with her alone (which is all the time) and there isn’t a family restroom available? The easiest answer would be the mens room but those stalls can be disgusting. I would think the women’s room would be a better option for her but wouldn’t want to make anyone uncomfortable by me being in there. Am I overthinking this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

Now we're back to her calling for daddy in the night, multiple times a night, and him contact sleeping with her until she a) falls asleep or b) he realizes he fell asleep and comes back to the room. Problem is, lately, he's been leaving and almost instaneously she wakes realizing he isn't there. She doesn't seem to be teething; this happens even with ibuprofen administered, which leads me to believe this is a behavioral thing. She has a diffuser with essential oils for sleep with she loves, nighttime stickers to incentivize sleep, ambient music, and a nice dark room. She still gets put down for a nap and is very particular about touch (she likes to rub my skin).  Those of you that have been in similar circumstances, what did you do?",

    "self_text": "My three-year-old attends a Montessori preschool - in theory.  In practice she's spent almost half of the days that she should have been in school at home instead, because their health policy says kids have to be symptom free for 48 hours after  any  symptom, even a runny nose with no other symptoms.   Based on my experience with my older kid I thought it was normal for a three year in daycare old to have a constantly runny nose but our teachers insist that it's not.  They asked us to take her to the doctor to investigate why she's always snotty and the doc was like \"yeah, she has a runny nose because she's 3 and she's in daycare\".    Does your preschool allow kids with a runny nose to attend?    Does this policy seem reasonable to you?  There are 20 kids and 3 teacher and an emphasis on self-reliance, so I kind of see where they're coming from, but I also am not able to get enough work done.  Admittedly the snot in this case ranges into yellow territory sometimes.  FWIW as far as snot mitigation, we did the snot sucker a few times and she hated it; we made the mistake of forcing the issue another time and it was traumatic for her and she's been afraid to visit the doctor or dentist or otherwise give up any bodily autonomy since then.  I've got a nasal rinse that I'd like to use on her, and she's aware there are a bunch of rewards available (candy, stickers, fun videos) if she consents, but she won't hear of it and I really don't want to force it again.  We're doing OK at keeping her hydrated and we've mostly cut out dairy.  We have an appointment with an allergist coming up though it doesn't seem like allergies.",

A few times he said yes and did it without arguing, so I assumed he was keeping up okay. Then we had conferences and progress reports and found out he was not keeping up as well as we had hoped.  So now we're cracking down even harder, checking his assignment notebook everyday and pretty much questioning him whenever he says he doesn't have any work. I feel like the only way I can trust what he says is to check in with the teacher and directly ask them, but I don't want to be one of those annoying parents.  When do I leave it totally up to him and let him suffer the consequences after the fact if he doesn't complete them, and when do I step in and start contacting the teachers?",

    "self_text": "So we are in a long custody battle.  The most recent order has brothers (full) being split up 5 days a week and only seeing each other on wknds because the teen got tired of living with his mom and wanted to come live with us but mom refused to give up The 7 year old so the judge just gave one to us and one to her with the kids seeing each other on wknds.  We told them repeatedly the brothers did not want to be split up (teen even told the judge he does not want to be apart from his brother and would prefer that he come with him) and this would be hard on the younger, but I guess they want to do this temporarily for 6 months to see how they do.  It has been one week on the new schedule and 7 year old on our wknd is throwing tantrums, saying he wants to tell the judge to give him his brother back and he wants to go back to the “old days” when they both lived with us.  It is hard to discern what is real and what is children trying to say what they think a parent wants to hear.  I (stepmom) was just talking to him the other day after he screamed at me asking him what was going on with him and if he was ok as this was not usual for him.  He told me “its his mom” and “he has been so angry lately” because his mom “makes him so mad”.  I told his dad and we asked him what happened and he told us:    his mom shaved his head bald and basically threatened to take his toys away if he didnt let her do it.  He doesn’t like his haircut.    his mom puts him in timeout if he gets his homework wrong.  He was crying and she told him to “shut up”.    we also know she “smacks him” and at one point left a nail mark on his arm (small, not bruised or anything).  This isn’t to say mom is abusive or terrible, she just sometimes gets stressed out and i think lashes out at the kids.  She is usually nice to the kids but has a pattern of not putting their needs first if it benefits her.  we are worried about him dealing with not seeing his brother, feeling bad because his brother gets to come over more and he has to reduce time with us (he used to see us almost every wknd but now its  every other wknd, due to the judge wanting brothers to have wknds together at each household).  So far we have not said anything negative about his mom just encouraged him to express his emotions to us or her - eg, “when you say this it makes me feel sad” and talk to his mom.  How do we talk to him about this and help him? Therapy is difficult as we are not able to take him seeing him only every other wknd and his mom is not reliable or trustworthy (she has tried alienating him in the past and telling him to stay away from me, dad is trying to take him away from her, etc).",

Usually when she's upset or she wants something, she'll start whining - not words, just an annoyed \"mmmmmmm!\" and maybe pointing at something.  When she does this my wife immediately starts trying to figure out what she wants to get her to stop. She'll grab her toys, get her snacks, pick her up, etc. She clearly gets stressed out by our daughter being upset and want to make her not upset as fast as possible.  Me on the other hand, unless she's actively in distress I don't worry about her whining. I'll try to figure out what it is of course, and I don't ignore her, but if I'm doing something else I'll finish what I'm doing before seeing what she wants. And if she wants something she can't have I just won't let her have it. Basically I think it's ok for her to be annoyed or bored sometimes and feel those feelings. A lot of the time she just needs something that is going to take some time (getting a bottle ready, changing her, putting her to bed) and she's going to just be cranky until she gets that. And that's ok, because once she gets changed/fed/put to bed she'll be fine. She doesn't need constant comforting and toys and whatnot.  But she is only 1 year old, and I don't really know if I'm right about this. I know babies basically can't be coddled enough, and I'm not sure she's old enough yet where she doesn't need constant comforting.

She used to fall asleep around 8pm and now it's more like 10pm, last night it was 11pm! There doesn't seem to be anything that has triggered it, she is doing really well in school, has a great friendship group and we are a very happy little family (she is an only child so it's just her, my partner and me) She eats dinner, has a bath, plays for 30mins in her room and then she reads or we read to her for 30mins. It used to be lights out at 8pm and then she would fall asleep. When the trouble started she would complain she couldn't sleep so we told her to read a while longer and turn out the light when she got sleepy. She would do this but then get really stressed that she couldn't fall asleep, we would put on a sleep meditation which worked for a while. She then claimed the sleep meditations were keeping her awake and she would be very upset and stressed that couldn't get to sleep and would become inconsolable and angry and her emotions would be all over the place. As it was taking her so long to get to sleep I wondered if her bedtime was too early so moved lights out to 8.30pm. This hasn't worked either. I've tried going in to check on her every 5mins after lights out. I've bought her a mattress topper as she said her bed was too hard (which ended with her wanting to sleep on the floor because her bed was too soft).  I have run out of ideas! I'm so worried about her not getting enough sleep!  Her father died when she was 2 and she can't really remember him and my partner has been in the picture since she was 4 so I don't think its related but wondering if there might be big emotions she doesn't understand causing this??? Has anyone had any similar situations with regards to 8year old sleeping problems or just any suggestions I can try?? Sorry for the long post!",

I hv an amazing husband who realized in second month that pumping and putting LO to sleep is taking a big toll on my sleep and he took over night sleeps. Thankfully LO has always been a good sleeper so it hasn't been very taxing on him but there is almost half an hour to an hour of rocking involved each night. Since I used to pump during that time and my husband used to rock LO , we both got good sleep an system was working fine.  We both split everything pretty much equally in our marriage and that has been the case since the very beginning and it continued through the first year too. Now that I hv stopped pumping after reaching my goal of 1 year , I can finally find mlre time to spend with LO. Butttt, she doesn't want to sleep with me anymore. All she wants is her dad. If he is in the room when I make an attempt,  she won't even come to me. If he is not in the room , she does sometimes sleep but it's a very hard task. It's not like I haven't put her to sleep in the entire year, she has always slept well with me on handful of occasions when my husband was busy or out of house, it's been not that frequent but we didn't hv any issues of this magnitude before.  Now everytime LO wants comfort, she runs to dad. Sleeps with dad. LO is very active child. During day she has no issues playing with me, I read books with her, I feed her, we spend a lot of time together but she will not sleep with me whatsoever.   I get it, I had to pump, I couldn't give her time when she was younger but I am trying my hardest to make her feel close to me so we can split the night sleep routine as well. It literally breaks my heart everyday multiple times that she runs to her father when I am right there when she falls or gets hurt or hungry or sleepy. I know we did what we did as it was easier for me but I am regretting all decisions I ever took in my parenting journey till now. My husband is a gem but I do tend to lash out on him when she runs to him for comfort,  I know its not his fault.   I dunno how to get past feeling defeated with each passing incident,  any advice reddit? Will my LO ever treat me as a mom?",

(Once she was in our bed though, she was more interested in jumping around than actually sleeping). I also think the behavior may have started when we were visiting her grandma for Thanksgiving. She was staying in the same room she always does when visiting which has a dollhouse that she loves to play with. The first night we were there, she didn't get to play with it at first so when she saw it at bedtime she started throwing a tantrum until we let her play with it for a little bit.   Since then, she has been difficult to put to sleep in her own bed. Some nights she is defiant right from the start and some nights she will go to sleep for a few hours and then wake up and protest going back to sleep. Since that first night, we have been trying to get her back on her normal routine and stood firm on making her sleep in her own bed and usually within an hour she's calmed down and back to sleep.  However, last night was different and my wife and I are at our wits end. We did our normal bath, book, lullaby routine and she went right to sleep without any trouble. We figured we had nipped it in the bud and she was back to normal. But around midnight she woke up and had a full on meltdown. She was asking for anything and everything to distract from going back to sleep. She wanted water (she already had a sippy cup). She wanted something to eat (she had just eaten before bed). The only one we relented on was when she asked to use the potty since she's starting to make progress on potty training, but this too was a distraction as she would just sit there and not actually use it. We tried staying in her room with her and consoling her for hours but she wouldn't give up. We even tried twice to just restart her bedtime routine, the second time even putting her back in the bath, but once she was back in her room the screaming started right back up again. At one point we finally got her to lay down and go back to sleep, but about 10 mins after we had gone back to our room she was up again. At about 4am after almost 4 hours of this (and her also waking up our 5 mo), we gave up and let her sleep with us. She went right to sleep in our bed.   Now I'm concerned we've reinforced this behavior even more and that it's going to become a nightly thing where she won't sleep in her own bed anymore. She's been good about sleeping through the night for a long time so this is a really new problem for us and we're not sure how to handle it going forward. Do we need to be even more patient and stay with her in her own room until she finally gets tired and falls asleep? I'm tempted to let her cry it out in her room, but the problem with this is she wakes the baby across the hall from banging on the door and can eventually open the door and will come into our room anyway.",

    "self_text": "I've been a sahm for five years. Two kids. It's really pained me to admit to myself that I miss working and that our financial situation would be much easier if I brought in an income. My husband encouraged me to stay at home after our first when I was planning to return PT, because we would only break even on childcare. I sometimes resent him for that because I think it would have been worth it, psychologically, to stay in the workforce. Anyway, mostly it's been hard to admit that I really really miss work and feel like I haven't lived up to my potential by skipping out on grad school. I was doing OK with just one kid at home, but when we added the second, I started to burn out. I put a lot of pressure on myself to never use the tv, to be very \"conscious\" as a parent, read books and articles about parenting methods, go to all the library groups and playdates with moms I couldn't fit in with... I never wanted my kids in daycare like I was. I realize now that a lot of this was a reaction and overcompensation for my own childhood trauma, and my anxious hovering has likely impacted my oldest, making her a bit anxious (or perhaps it's inherited temperament?). So I've been doing some introspecting and trying to make a plan..  We have zero childcare at the moment and I'm taking a certificate class and volunteering. My family of origin is a mess, and I've had to stop my mother from watching my kids, which has meant we are doing this on our own. Right now the TV is my babysitter which makes me feel guilty but I have no clue how else I'm supposed to write my essay for grad school applications with only an hour or two in the evenings (I pass out when the kids are finally asleep. My youngest will not fall asleep without me, so if I'm downstairs working late, he's still up at 9pm screaming for me...he's 2 and nurses to sleep). I can tell my husband isn't always happy with the TV thing--neither am I--but I just don't know what else to do. We can't afford a part time nanny and I'm just beginning to look at daycares we can afford for my youngest, part time.  I love my children. I am having a hard time making the mental change from sahm parent, potentially homeschooling, to putting my kids in school and working on establishing a career at near midlife. I know if I don't try to do this, I will face a lot of disappointment with myself, though. I'm already stressed and feel like I am short with my kids and not really present with them in the ways they deserve because I don't have enough time to do anything for myself, and honestly, the daily 8+ hours of relentless caregiving for 5 years has just worn me down. I want to be in the adult world. Ideally, I would just work part time and be with my kids, but I have a goal of a certain career which will require some more full time work to establish at first. Ideally, I would have a bunch of supportive and healthy family and friends but here we are, just my husband and I, and it feels like we are drowning.  Just wondering if any other sahp's have transitioned out of their role... how did you deal with the feelings of missing something you realize isn't really working for you? How did you handle a transition to daycare etc for a younger child? It's so hard struggling toward something unknown and feeling like if you could just be content in the life you have now, things would be easier...",

We see both sides - one on hand, I would love to experience and understand the love for a child and share life with them, but on the other hand we know having a kid would change our very independent lives and the kid is going to be their own person (which could easily be a source of stress, worry, frustration, etc.)  I know there will be people with opinions on both sides of this. What I’m more so looking for are perspectives and opinions from parents with anxiety. After losing my mom three years ago, unfortunately my mind decided it was going full send into anxiety and stress land. I’ve really made great strides going to therapy, communicating what I need, getting on meds at one point, etc. But I’m not back to the old, more carefree me and am not sure if I’ll ever get there again. So, this is obviously on our minds too as we think about kids, both for their sake and ours. I’m not sure if this makes me more susceptible to postpartum depression, but we wonder how a baby will affect my mindset and mental health. Maybe it could help me see what’s important in life and let go of all the little stuff, or maybe it could really stretch my stress levels negatively. Would love to hear your experiences and advice.",

I’m hoping for some advice on how to get sleep, short of putting in ear plugs so I can make sure to actually hear him when he needs me. Is there any way to keep him calm and sleeping without holding him or do you have any tricks for getting to sleep with the noises?

I said \"oh that doesn't seem age appropriate\" out loud and my husband got angry at me for saying that. I actually don't know if it is, but it says \"baby\" on the tag and it only specifies the cms/inches for the size. Clearly no harm in using it but it feels like our kid should learn to sleep and cover himself on his own, as in managing to pull his own blanket when he is cold instead of calling for us to cover him at night at 4 years old. I am very thankful to the aunt in law, clearly, she is a very sweet lady and I am certain she had the best intentions when she was getting it. She has a kid and her kid loves their sleeping suit but I should be allowed to say a sleeping suit is not appropriate at 4 years old. I just don't know if I should let son use it if he won't learn to pull his own blankets by the time the suit doesn't fit? Thoughts?",

If we stay til the end of the years, I'll be without my husband during the week for the next 5 months. If I move them now, I have to figure out alternative plans for one of my kids. LONG POST AHEAD.  So we're moving to a new city about 2 hours away. My husband got promoted and so we're going through the selling and moving and finding new schools and basically everything is changing lol   I did all my research and found a great school that I thought could take both my kids, 1st grade and Prek3. We had the tour today and it turns out they only have a spot for one in the spring semester (1st grade)  and they will have an opening for the other the next semester for Prek4.  Well after my initial shock, I started mulling over WTF I'm gonna do. Long story short, I work full time from home and my husband works a lot of hours at a high stress job ...I'm the primary parent so all the drop off, pick up, and after school stuff is on me. My kids currently attend a catholic school that has prek3, which has been great for my 3 year old and awesome for me because they're finally at the same place and same schedule. I have been mulling over my options all day and I'd love some advice from anyone who has moved in the middle of the school year.    stay through the end of the school year at their current school. My dad lives in our current town and has told me we would be welcome to stay if need be. This option would be able to keep them both in school and finish the year with their friends. The down side is we wouldn't be together as a family for about 5 months. We would go up to our new house for the weekends and spend time together as a family, then during the week stay with my dad. We would make the official move once the school year is over.    Move my one child to the new school and hire a nanny to help part time until he starts school with his brother in the fall. I have looked at a few other options for preschool and daycare and I really don't want to put him in a new school for 5 months only to move him to another school....this kid has already been to 3 different schools in the last two years, I know kids are resilient but it's a major stressor of mine.    Another stressor I have it that since I'm in charge with pick up and drop off, them being two different places will take me longer and that will cut in to my work time. My boss is supportive but it will take me an hour as opposed to 30 mins and I have to make up that time at the end of the day.  Idk what the best option is but I'd love any tips from anyone who has moved in the middle of the school year or who has dealt with being away from your spouse for long stretches....needless to say I'm stressed AF lol",

    "self_text": "I’ve come to realize that I may be a bad parent. Prior to getting into a relationship with someone who had a kid I never thought much about being a parent or having children. I moved too fast and we ended up marrying too soon. A year later we were expecting. Before I even had a chance to realize what I had done it was far too late. Resentment, frustration and arguments were and are the norm now.   One of most heated debates occurs when I tell her I don’t think she should’ve had children, most especially two. She takes it as an attack on her character or her personally (like everything we discuss) when I simply want to have a real and candid convo about ideal lifestyles and personality types.   Based on her behavior and statements over the years I’ve always concluded that she really shouldn’t have had children. Don’t get me wrong she’s a decent mother, but I think she lacks that natural maternal, nurturing spirit you need as a mom.   She can’t really cook well at all. She doesn’t clean often and is really messy and disorganized. Her day usually starts with her brewing coffee, having a phone conference with her sister and mother. She’s always in need of a “break” from parenting which I think is healthy for any parent but with her it’s excessive.   She buys all white linen and nice furniture knowing the kids will ruin it all eventually even though we set boundaries. Kids are always gonna find a way. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with wanting those things I just wish she set the proper expectations on how things will turn out. You can buy a plush white rug and think a 4 year old is gonna keep off of it.  That’s where we differ. I know I’m not much of a dad but I try to do my best. I realize it’s a sacrifice. I don’t complain about needing breaks all the time because this is the bed I’ve made. If I can get my parents to watch em sometimes that’s great but I’ve learned that parenting is a full time job. You’re really blessed if you have a support system.  I just wish she’d come to terms with that fact that she probably shouldn’t have had children. I think she’s doing well enough but it honestly isn’t something that everyone needs or should embark on.  🚨ATTENTION🚨  I know it’s tons of fun to dog pile on the OP but you people do not know me nor what I go through and have been through for the past several years. I shared this in hopes that people would understand my frustration but now I see that was a mistake and I’m being made out to be some kind of monster. Telling someone they’re an unfit parent isn’t murder. What I hoped to accomplish was a candid dialogue with my wife on how, based on her personality and lifestyle preferences, she would’ve been better suited having children later in life or not at all. The first step to getting help is admittance. As I type this guess who has the kiddos and guess who’s across the state living their best life for the weekend?   Additionally, I can’t tell you how many times she said resentful, hurtful things right to our child’s face. How she’s done with him. How he can go live with me and she could’ve/should’ve flushed him down the toilet. People like the idea of parenting and having cute, cuddly babies but this shit is far from a fairytale. It is the hardest task you can take on in this life. So everyone jumping on me about disrespecting her can stfu now!",

I guess I appreciate that she asked but it was super awkward for me to have to say I didn’t feel comfortable with that. The whole night she was making comments about not being able to hold him and how it was “killing her” and she kept talking to my son about it in a baby voice. She’s a very sincere person and I know she wasn’t trying to upset me but it just really rubbed me the wrong way. She also said that she couldn’t wait to snuggle him and kiss him in a few days. Not gonna happen. I shouldn’t have to tell people not to kiss my baby, especially in the winter when RSV is going around. I hate to be “that mom” but my child’s safety comes before anything else and no one should expect to be able to hold someone else’s baby or try to make them feel bad for saying no.

To the point where if she decides it’s bath time. She has to stop whatever she is doing and go straight in the bath. If she doesn’t want to she will manipulate our daughter by saying she will go and use the fizzy herself(to make daughter jealous). This extends to other things. Like she doesn’t tell our daughter she’s going to daycare until she gets dropped off, or tells her there is mosquitos if she wants her to come inside but it’s the middle of the day. I can feel the control she is exerting on our daughter and I tend to get it a bit from my partner as well so I relate to it and believe it’s frustrating our daughter, making her hate bed time even more.  I like to be more relaxed with our daughter. I tell her it’s bath time, if she doesn’t want to go I say ok, we will go in 10 minutes. If she doesn’t eventually agree which happens 4/5 times, I just force her to go in the bath anyway. She has a tantrum and I just try to explain that she has to have a bath even if she doesn’t want to. If she doesn’t want to go bed I just let her stay up and do night time stuff. We go outside and look at the stars, or read a book or just cuddle on the couch. Eventually she just puts herself to bed when she’s ready.  My thinking is that if she isn’t tired, why should we make her go to bed? I wouldn’t accept someone making me go to bed if I’m not ready. My partner seems really caught up on the idea that she must go to bed at 8pm every night and because she’s not she’s got to exert so much into a second by second specific bed time routine where our daughter is being tricked into doing stuff and developing such a negative relationship with sleep.  I have talked to my partner about this and she has said that she’s just doing what she feels she has to because things are so hard.  I don’t know if I’m right or wrong about this or if my partner is or what the answer is.  Our daughter had a cot 8 months ago. If she didn’t go willingly we would just put her in there, she would cry for 10 minutes and go to sleep. Most of the time she wouldn’t cry and just go to sleep when we were doing this. Then she could climb out so my partner decided to turn it into a bed and we have had issues ever since.   I have also tried to just adjust my expectations around this in that having a 2 year old is difficult and we just have to make do. I tend to think that because I have always had a bit of a delayed circadian rhythm myself (sleep 1am-7am) most nights that she has picked that up and naturally has a later bed time than is common for her age.",

TW***  My sister is in her 30s with 3 kids (6, 4, 3). The eldest was on India since 2020 and finally got home 3 weeks ago. my sister's ex husband's family wouldn't give her back. My sister's ex is in prison now (since the spring) and she's going through a rough time. However, she has some severe mental health problems and an alcohol addiction. To try and keep this short, past events are:  -jail for child endangerment for driving under the influence with the kids (youngest wasn't born yet).   -suicide attempts (she's had I think close to 10 since the oldest was born and has been hospitalized several times).   -running away and disappearing for several days at a time.   Yesterday her boyfriend calls and says she's in the hospital because she got drunk, took a bottle of pills and cut her wrists in the tub, she was seizing when he found her. I called local law enforcement and got permission to get the kids, they are currently with me. However, she got released this morning and is wanting to come down and get the kids. I think this is a horrible idea.   I've called and made a report to DCF and contacted the local office but the case worker said she can't do anything until she gets the report which could be today or next week.   I don't know what to do. I'm so worried for the kid's safety and I don't want my sister to take them back until she gets the proper help she needs.   This is a lot. I have 3 kids as well (8, 6, 1). I work from home and am the only income. My husband is a full time student for undergrad and I'm working on a Masters and my husband is in the national guard and will be gone next weekend.

My old crotchety neighbor came out today and made conversation with me, then asked where the little one was. I showed her the video monitor and said she’s sleeping inside (literally 15 feet away). She made a face and hurried back in. Whatever, grab my oldest and start do our after school routine. I get a knock 5 minutes later, and it’s the cops. They had a report about a baby being left home alone. I explained and they left but I am LIVID.   Do I just ignore this? I can literally watch her on the monitor and step inside within 20 seconds. I’m an anxious person anyway and this is making me nervous.  Edit/Update: I just logged in since posting and wow! I didn’t expect this to blow up.

My neighbor's mom made a comment about how there have been 3 shootings recently. One at a college, one at a night club, and one at a Walmart. My daughter overheard and that set off some more panic. She keeps asking to sleep in our bed and today my husband and I went out for a day date. We left her at said friend/neighbors house and before we left she gave me a hug and started crying about how afraid she was that we were going to get shot and killed at the movies. I was able to calm her down and we went out. My friend/neighbor said she was fine after we left. I just put her down to bed and she still expressed some fears. I told her it is highly unlikely that anything would happen and how this is another reason it is important to vote for what you believe in. Is there anything else I can do? Do I need to bring her to a therapist at this point?",

The unique thing with this game is that he gets to watch what he finds interesting which is more rewarding than what a typical toddler game would provide (e.g. sound of clapping and animation of some kind of celebration).  The game would play Youtube but pauses the video regularly and ask him to answer a multiple choice question. The question can be for example: which one is letter \"A\"? If he answers it right, then the video continue playing immediately and lasts for let's say 5 minutes. If he answers wrong, then the correct answer is revealed to him and there's a compulsory wait for 10 s, and then the video plays for a short time (let's say 20 seconds) before the same question get asked again.  Has anyone seen or heard of such a game? Or is anyone interested to make this game and release it in a month? If not, I'm going to try to do it myself. Helps/collaborators are very welcomed.  Additionally:  - Since it's multiple choice question, it's easy to have a way for parents to customize the question (and answer).   - The difficulty level can be automatically changed by increasing/decreasing the number of answers to choose from (in the multiple choice question).   - Can add SRS (spaced repetition system) to manage the questions, so that the ones that are too easy are not asked as frequently.",

    "title": "Struggles with TK/K",
    "self_text": "I’m hoping some experiences can help me.  Y son turned 5 after the school year started but through a lot of work and interdistrict paperwork we were able to get him into a TK program at a school near by. He’s always had some trouble with transitions but he’s a smart boy and we figured big boy school would be good for him. He can read fluidly and sound out words he’s never read before, he loves space and science. The kid has a favorite dwarf planet. From pretty much a week into the school year we began having issues. He didn’t want to go to school, and we had difficult drop offs. He was also leaving the class room. I took that to mean he was usually standing outside the door. A few times I got calls to come get him because he wouldn’t go back in. The teacher seemed intent on him not going to school and her direction was pretty consistently that he didn’t seem ready, but before we made a dramatic decision I wanted to engage in an iep and discuss with a therapist to ensure we didn’t have any neurological issues that may be making it seem like maturity. I don’t think he has ASD (neither does his doctor or the therapist we’re talking to, but a family friend with autistic kids as well as my sister think he does) but I’m fairly confident he has ADHD in which case an extra year may not be the solution. Not to mention isn’t that the point of transitional Kindergarten? We tried rewards, hell at one point I was offering $10 Robux if he stayed in class all day. Teacher never had a single positive to say and just always seemed upset and exasperated. She seemed great to all the other parents. I’m a big guy so I just figured maybe there was some intimidation or something causing her to be weird in her interactions so I always went out of my way to talk calmly and kindly. I know how exhausting it must be to take responsibility for 15 kiddos between 4-6. The office staff said any time he was there he was calm, polite, engaging, and charismatic. So I had engaged a therapist and the principle for the iep. I kept the teacher in the loop. At her request I joined the classroom to observe. When I arrived at the school my child was alone on the playground without a single adult in sight. The office let me know they had gotten a couple calls already from the teacher. No reason as to why they hadn’t gone to deal with things. The teacher let me know he had never come in after snack. So he was left unattended for an hour. Worse yet they are moving classrooms and the new class is connected to the larger area of the campus. It’s much more dangerous now for him to be alone because of the sheer size of that space. I offered to provide and install a child safety gate and sent a follow up to the principal with my concerns as well. Right now I’m not letting him go back until we discuss the safety issue. Of course we want him in class, but knowing this is an issue I want him to be safe while we work on that. I emailed the principal and teacher first thing Monday and haven’t heard a word back. I am heartbroken about this. I want my son to have a good school experience but while I would never say this in front of him it just really feels like the teacher had no interest in helping him succeed and frankly straight up didn’t like him. I also accept that maybe I pushed too soon, but I’m afraid that isn’t it and by not addressing whatever the issue is now we will be hampering his success next year too. Would love any insights or any experiences from other parents because as a dad I’m constantly in a state of wanting to cry worrying about my guy right now.",

Undermines my cousin at every turn. Their oldest has started stealing, cussing at everyone, trying to get out of going school. There's no boundaries in this kids mind. Everything my cousin has tried to do is fruitless because of his lack parenting.   Their second missed out on so much potential help because this guy refused to admit that something was wrong with his boy. He's autistic, and we told this guy many times that something was wrong. Wouldn't even listen to the birth to 3 people when they said something wasn't right and that he was missing major milestones. He's now 8 and still non verbal and is just now  potty training. He had to be put in a special school to handle him. And it's because of that school that he's making so many gains in his development.  They now have another child who is looking at an autism diagnosis as she is 3 and has missed many of her milestones as well.   She wants to leave, but he has financial control over her as she's not working, they have 1 car (he killed the one I sold to her by running it on no oil). She almost got out when their 3rd child died at 2 months old (that's a loaded story in itself) but he got his hands on their oldest and I think made some threats to get my cousin back home.   I want to help her get out. But I have no idea where to send her. What links to send to get her help. Her kids are all suffering because of the way this guy is treating my cousin and refusing to parent. Or support her in anyway other than paying the bills.   We're in Connecticut, USA. If you have any resources I can send her to or send to her, please. I wanna help her. She's the only person on that side of my family I have left.

I talked to him about it and all he could say was that he didn't know why he did it. I thought i appropriately punished him by taking away all the things he liked. I even asked a few police officers to speak to him about the consequences of stealing (not to scare him but because he wants to be a police officer when he grows up). In the following months I've caught him stealing from my mom again, from kids at school, from the store and most recently from me. When i caught him stealing from the store i started making him take everything back every time. I've taken away his games toys tv outings everything at this point and I'm lost. I sit down and talk to him and it's always \"i don't know\" but this last time he stole from me he told me that it's because he misses his dad. I feel like I'm a sh!tty parent and honestly maybe I'm doing something wrong that i can't see so maybe someone can give me an objective opinion an advice idk but i don't want son to keep stealing. He's only 8 and i can't sit here and tell him adult business. His dad isn't involved by his own choice. Talking to his dad is out of the question i don't even have his number or address nothing. But I feel i hit a wall in this matter and i don't want to parent like my parents because whooping his behind is not goin to work.

Her little sister is only 17 months younger so we still have everything to use for her. Little one's birthday is coming up and I have no idea what to put on the Amazon gift list. I don't want a bunch of toys or clothes so what do I ask for? People tend to want to buy actual gifts, not do cash or tickets to things so I'm asking for suggestions other than gift cards or experiences. Thanks in advance!",

    "self_text": "I have two children six and seven and two nephews and one niece. Since the beginning my husband and I agree on how many gifts our kids get for birthday and Christmas and one for the niece and nephew. Before we even did Easter and stocking stuffers for all of them.  Until we noticed that our children barely got anything. My sister-in-laws we're acceptable because they struggle financially and usually give small gifts. My BIL and his ex wife is another story. They have one child and usually spend 700 total on him for Christmas. They don't buy presents for any of the other kids.  In fact, last year, he bought a friend's kid a gift. Nothing for anyone else.  This year we'll be spending less because of inflation and money. We want to spend less or maybe not do much for our niece and nephews because of that and what I described.  I will admit, I may be being petty or annoyed at this treatment. That's a very good possibility. We're tired and don't have a ton of money ourselves to do this.  Edit: I should clarify that I still want to get each of them Christmas presents and maybe one of those chocolate santas. In years past we used to do $25-40 to the nephews and niece. I want to do 15-20 and something small only. This is making me feel like a grumpy aunt, whose making other kids suffer because BIL and his ex wife only buy presents for their child.",

    "self_text": "Just to be fair, I will explain since I have never worked in child care.  I pick up my kids, 1 yr old and 2 yr old, from day care yesterday. My one year old is handed to me with tears in his eyes and on his face and a red mark under his eye.  I immediately, asked to speak to the daycare worker brought my kid out. She was called back out. I pulled her to the side and I asked where was B (1yr old) when you went to his classroom to get him? She said in his class room sitting in a high chair. I said okay. Do you have any clue as to why he's crying with a red mark on his face?  She answers, no I have no idea. He was just ready to go home. I asked to then speak to the teacher who was in the room and the lady told me she had left.  Okay....granted I do go to school full time and work part time so my kids are at daycare a lengthy amount of time. I have to admit. I don't even like it. But as a single mother I have to use child care.   So I returned to the car and was buckling my kids in when I had 3 staff members come up and continuously start making comments.... \"Nobody hit or touched your kid if that's what your thinking\", \"what's the issue ma'am\" and one taking pictures of my son's face while he is in the car seat in the car bc I'm strapping my other child in....  I got them buckled in and said \"look I just want to go home\" bc I felt that I really needed a moment to gather myself. But then one of the 3 ladies spoke out and said...\"I was the teacher in the room\".  So after strapping the kids in I turned to them and said...\"I don't think someone hit my child. All I know is he was brought out to me with tears and a mark on his face, and I'm confused on why the mark is there for one and two why he is crying???\" The lady said \"He was asleep in the chair because I was cleaning\".   Okay granted, it is 5 in the afternoon. I know these people are ready to go home. But WHEN is it okay to let a child nap at 5 in the afternoon and in A HIGHCHAIR, bent over with his face laying on the table/arm of it???? So that your staff can clean??? Not valid. I am a single mother and my house REALLY could use some cleaning since I am gone all day everyday. That still has never been an excuses for me to put my children in a high chair and let them sleep bent over with their face laying on it!!   Am I over reacting??",

My life is really a mess because of her. She came to US to pursue higher studies in 2013 & later I came to do higher studies in 2015. I loved a guy(classmate & we both same country) married him in 2017 who is earning much less than my sister & I’m not working as I had a baby in 2019 & as I have no support from parents or anyone I had to look after my baby & my husband is solo bread winner.My sister has big dreams like marrying rich & citizen of US & settle down here without any immigration headache like work permit. Now she doesn’t marry anyone as she cannot find anyone as she is only looking after money and visa status but no love. Which ever state we go she follows us. Asks me & my husband to look for a house. Stayed in my  for 3 months for free where we are renting & later as the house owner knew that as asked us to vacate the house.due to her we have to suffer. She just uses us for her needs. Asks us to look for a house for cheap. Asks help to move her things from one house to another during vacating a house. Cries in front of my parents that we don’t help her nor invite her to our house(where I’m struggling with a toddler)she doesn’t want to help me. I went through C section delivery. My mom came to visit & fought with me for a month stating why should she help me am I your servant she questioned me. She loves her grand son but she hates me as I married a guy of my choice. She always shows her concern on my sister that she is struggling all alone in US & I’m having my husband to support. My mom says me and my husband should help my sister is searching for house if she needs to move and shift her belongings from one house to other. My dad insists me to ask my husband to make my sister to stay with us as my sister is working and cannot cook & I should help by cooking and she will pay half the rent as my husband is earning less(how would I allow an unmarried lady who is selfish of me and staying with a couple & toddler in a 1 bed apartment, does it make sense) my mom says I should not have second kid till my sister gets married? Now as I’m going into depression staying 10 minutes away distance from my sister my husband is planning to move us to another state & now she is saying that she also will move along with us. She always says that if my parents want to visit it’s easy for them to travel between our houses but actually thing is my sister & mom wants us to stay near because she comes to our house when she wants takes food from us & us to bring groceries to her . Takes help from us during moving and all. Where is my life going? No peace between me & my husband as my husband is fed up of my family. Please suggest me what I can do?",

    "self_text": "Hi everyone. I’ve had two children: the first was born at 40+5 and the second at 26+4. I’m incredibly lucky that my youngest pulled through and is now a happy 1 year old.  My husband and I had always wanted three children but now we are so conflicted about what to do.   There was no infection found that could’ve resulted into me going into premature labour. My consultant says that my youngest premature birth could have been caused by ‘incompetent cervix’ but we won’t know this until I have another pregnancy and they monitor my cervix. If the cervix dilated they can put a stitch in but this isn’t guaranteed to work. My consultant has also said that my history isn’t typical of someone with incompetent cervix as my eldest was born at term with no complications. However, there is an increased risk of going in to early labour again if we decide to have another baby.  I know I couldn’t put myself or a baby through what we went through with my second. (We’ve already suffered two miscarriages as well so it’s been a rough time for us.) But our dream has always been to have a large family with lots of noise, laughter etc. and I’m finding it hard to let that dream go.  Does anyone have any practical advice (if you’ve had a premature birth and tried for another baby)? Or does anyone have any general advice of how to pull myself out of this funk? I think about it daily and just don’t know what to do.",

    "self_text": "My daughter has become close friends with a girl in her class. The mother of this friend personally got my contact information from the teacher to invite my daughter to her daughter’s birthday party about a month ago. They attend a private school so being that it’s a small school I was so excited that she’s able to make a close friend as she had difficulty doing that last year. I have only communicated with the mother through texts, my husband did meet her once during a field trip where they were both chaperones. The friend’s mother has communicated that we should set up a play date for both kids but we haven’t planned anything. She doesn’t know what I look like and I literally did not know what she looked like till yesterday.   Yesterday, my husband and I attended our daughter’s Halloween parade at school. During the event we both waved at her and she literally snubbed her nose at us and ignored us as if she was embarrassed or something. Throughout the whole event she ignored us but she’s a shy person so we figured that she was just nervous with the amount of people that were at the event. After the parade, I went inside her school to pick her up, I saw her friend and her mother and her mom was taking pictures of her in her costume. They were looking for my daughter so they could take pictures together but she was apparently in the bathroom. When she came out the bathroom they took the pictures together, after taking the picture with her friend, she literally tapped her friend’s mother and said “I wish you were my mom”.    I will mention that throughout this whole encounter, no one recognized my presence, not even my daughter. I was just patiently waiting for them to finish chatting and taking pictures before I got her to leave   I literally wanted to disappear at that moment, I was beyond surprised and all the friend’s mom said was “Aww, sweetie…”. They all were not aware that I was standing there and heard everything. When her teacher did see me she called her attention and said it was time to leave. Out of embarrassment I just held her hand and started to walk out of the school. When I asked her why she said what she said she first tried to deny it and then when she realized that I actually heard her she started crying. Her father was extremely furious as we can not possibly think of why she could’ve said it. Later in the evening she said that the reason why she said what she had said was because she really likes her friend’s mother’s hair…. My daughter is mixed, I’m Black and her father is White so she has very curly hair. Her friend is White and her mother has long blonde straight hair.   She knows that we’re both disappointed but she’s five years old so I don’t think she really understands. I’m honestly conflicted, and I understand that I should not take it personally but it actually hurts a lot. I went through a lot of trauma with my mother both physically and emotionally and I’ve made every effort to not treat my daughter the same way because it’s extremely unfathomable to treat a child the way I was treated. I’m also conflicted at the friend’s mother, because if a child said that to me I would’ve definitely reassured or redirected the child instead of just saying “awww”. Maybe she didn’t know what to say? Plus her teacher didn’t say a thing either, the whole thing was so awkward and it was just more petrifying that they were and possibly still are not aware of the fact that I was there and heard it all. Now I just feel like it’ll be awkward and embarrassing to go on play dates as she may be thinking that I’m the worst parent ever. I just wanted some opinions on how others would feel and anyone has actually gone through this?",

    "self_text": "So my 5yo (almost 6) expressed that he wanted to learn to play the violin. It came after they explored the theme “music” at his class. I found it wonderful that he was interested. We came to a trial lesson which he said was “perfect”, had a 4 lesson trial course after which he said he wanted to continue. So now we signed him up to long term course.   I just don’t know what to expect and how to support him. Violin is notoriously difficult and require lot of commitment. Now it’s just 30’ per week which seems perfect for his attention span. But he has to practice in between lessons as well and I’d hate to have to nag him to do it everytime (which seems to start being the case). He is excited for lessons but at home violin practice has to compete with toys and screen time and he seems to prefer the latter.   So I have asked him several times if he wanted to drop the lessons and said that I didn’t want to pay for his lessons if that meant another thing I had to nag him to do. Which I find not so supportive and regretted saying later on.  My question is how I can manage expectations (he might drop the violin himself after just a few lessons? He might make little progress and be frustrated? I would have to keep telling him to practice 5 times per week for years to come?). And more importantly how can I support his choice (if he wants to continue or drops) while helps him to build up resilience and not acting on his whims, how to help him explore his interest in music? I would like to avoid this being a negative experience for him, especially from my actions and comments.   But I am at a loss as I didn’t play any musical instruments myself. Any advice would be appreciated!  A bit background: my son is really sensitive, especially for sounds. When he was little we used to not be able to put socks or shoes on him, and had to put the softest pants on him. He alao couldn’t be around other children without panicking. I guess the sensories were too much for him? As he gets older it becomes better though he is still shy and has some sensitivity with sounds. But he loves music and is quite good at it (maybe it’s related to his sensitivity?).   I am happy that he wants to explore more and violin might be a good match to his sensitive ears?",

I make enough money for our basic needs and some fun stuff too. I do my best to give my son a normal happy healthy life. We live with my parents and I don’t have a ton of money to spend on gifts.  My older brother and his wife make a couple of six figures a year. They have 2 kids. They own a very big house and their kids have every toy they’ve ever asked for.  My brother and I didn’t have a good relationship growing up, and only spend time in the same space because we have kids.  &#x200B;  My 1st question is how do I explain to my son (6M) why his cousin (9M) gets nicer gifts than him every Christmas and birthday?  &#x200B;  My 2nd question is how do I tell my family I don’t give a shit about Christmas because it’s become all about money, without coming off as a grinch to my nephews?  &#x200B;  My 3rd question - how do I deal with having to purchase a gift for my nephews that is good enough for my brother and his wife?  &#x200B;  Some Backstory:  As I mentioned, my brother makes a ton of money and can afford to buy his kids a lot. Everything from new Lego sets to dirtbikes.  While I’m happy that my nephews gets to live a full life, I don’t know how to explain to my son why they have it all and we don’t.  My son will ask me when I’ll buy us a house, or that he wants the same gifts as his cousin. Lately it’s been a Nintendo switch, an electric bike, a dirt bike, and this Christmas he’ll be getting a $5k+ surprise.  &#x200B;  Christmas for them is about who can buy the most. They’re not religious and it’s not about family. We don’t get gifts for each other because I can’t afford anything nice enough for them (what do you buy rich people who can afford everything they want?)  Every year for birthdays and Christmas my SIL make a list of “approved” gifts and it’s what the family is encouraged to buy from or it’s usually met with disgruntlement.  &#x200B;  I’m a sentimental person and love getting gifts from my heart but they’ve ruined it for me. When I’ve tried to buy something I liked/thought he would like I’ve been told to return it and pick something else or he doesn’t care for it at all because it wasn’t good/expensive enough.  &#x200B;  Some examples of issues we’ve had:  -I’ve been told to return a gift and buy something else because it was too similar to one a friend purchased.  -I gifted my nephews zoo tickets and they got mad at me for not “buying something that’s at least $20 so they could open it”  &#x200B;  I’m trying to teach my son that life is about giving and helping others and it’s not all about asking and what others give you.  I dread Christmas now and I don’t know how to deal with the stress and feeling like I’m a disappointment.  Please help me.  -A desperate broke mom/aunt  &#x200B;  TLDR; My rich family is usually disappointed in my gifts and I don’t know how to explain to my son why I can’t afford the nice things his cousins have.",

My daughter (11, 6th grade) and this girl (in her grade, but just switched to a private school this year) became kind of friendly over the last couple of years because we socialize with her parents. I don’t think they would have gravitated towards each other naturally. They are very different. The other girl is nice, but pushy and kind of a know-it-all. Doesn’t always seem to get social cues. I think she has struggled to make friends in both public and private school. The other girl I think considers my daughter a best friend, but not vice versa. My daughter can get along with this girl because my daughter is easygoing and will often let her have her way. It has come about that my daughter has told me she doesn’t particularly enjoy the other girl’s company all of the time and feels forced to hang out sometimes. She doesn’t dislike her but the pushiness bothers her.  The problem is, this girl’s parents are completely oblivious to the fact that our daughters aren’t truly that close. And they are just as pushy as the daughter. The mom has made many comments about how she sees a lifelong friendship between the 2 girls and how special their bond is, etc. I do get it… you want your kids to have close friends and it’s painful to watch them struggle. I’ve also been on the other end, where my daughter is seemingly more into a friendship than the other kid… and I like to think I’ve gotten the hint and backed off a bit on trying to initiate plans with the other parent when that becomes clear.  Both parents and this girl are incessant about our daughters hanging out. The other girl texts my daughter at least twice every weekend begging to get together and asks to be invited to our house- often asking to sleepover. My daughter feels badly saying no and sometimes ends up feeling forced to say yes. The mom is always telling me how much her daughter misses seeing my daughter if there is a lapse of time between get togethers. The girls do a weekly private lesson together after school so there already is fairly regular time together. Even then, the other girl is pushing for more hangout time after the lesson- it is constant.  I’ve been trying to teach my daughter about the importance of being inclusive and being there for someone who needs a friend. But I also feel like my daughter should have a say in who her close friends are. I’ve been trying to get the message across to the other mom by declining almost all get-togethers. But I’m still not quite sure my message is getting across, and I feel like we are getting bombarded from all sides: I’m getting texts from the mom, my husband is getting texts from the dad and the girl is constantly texting my daughter.  Should I keep doing what I’m doing and hoping the parents and daughter eventually get the hint? We have declined so many get togethers and I probably haven’t initiated plans for the kids in over 6 months so it’s very frustrating that the hint is not getting across. Should I nicely say something to the mom? It seems there will be some deeply hurt feelings and awkwardness after a potential talk and either way I feel like the bad guy. My husband really likes hanging out with the dad. For me, I feel neutral about the mom. And I don’t want to cut ties with them completely, I think my daughter is okay with a casual friendship, I just want my daughter to have a say! It’s a tough line between being there for another girl who seemingly needs/wants friends vs my daughter honoring her own wants, but hurting someone’s feelings.  Side note: the other girl lives in a very kind, supportive environment at home and I’m 99.999999% sure there aren’t issues at home she’s trying to get away from, she just wants a friend.",

He knows from right and wrong, cleans his room, puts his clothes away. He is making a ton of progress.   So he eats alot of cheese and always had issues with hard stools. I don’t mind plunging the toilet, since he can’t help it. I am grossed out when I see other people’s fecal matter though.   However last night I had alot to do in preparation of Thanksgiving. He stopped up the toilet and came to me laughing. My stepdaughter was like “You don’t want to see it!” He just kept looking at my laughing. He thought it was funny I had to take care of his shit. There was no, “Hey, I’m sorry this happened, can you fix it?” Just laughter because he knew it was  my responsibility    So I handed him the plunger and told him, “If you think its funny, you can do it.”. He stopped laughing and he started to plunge.   After 5 minutes of unsuccessful plunging I took over.  I told him “Its not so funny when you have to do it, is it?”. He apologized and went to his room.   So was I too harsh?",

    "self_text": "My husband & I are a blended family with 4 boys, all in their teens. The youngest is my biological son, the older 3 are his. The twins, who turn 17 in just a couple months, recently got their drivers licenses. We can’t afford the increase in our car insurance to add them to the policy, and they can’t afford to pay for it themselves, as neither of them are employed.   I found out yesterday that my husband recently let one of them drive his (my husband’s) car to go pick up some friends. I only found this out because said teen asked me last night if he could go pick up some friends and I said no because he’s not insured. He kept pushing about it, with one of his points being ‘but dad let me take his car to pick up friends before!’  My husband ‘doesn’t think it’s a big deal’, but from my understanding, being caught driving without insurance is not only illegal, but can lead to hefty fines, and possibly even a suspension of their license, as well. Am I crazy?? I’m getting real sick of being made out to be the bad guy just for exercising common sense and basic prudence, while dad gets to be the ‘cool parent’ because he says yes to nearly everything, without considering the implications/possible consequences.   Any input is appreciated, I feel like I can barely trust my own perspective anymore….",

My sister lives about 40 mins away and I asked her if I start working in December and pay her to watch them until they get into daycare which should be in January. She has a baby too that’s the same age as mine so she will be driving to my house at 6 a.m and watch the kids for 11 hours. I understand that’s long hours so she was saying $300 for 3 days is what she would charge. I agreed on it bc I don’t really have options for childcare plus she’s my sister. The reason she would drive to me is bc her house is not on the way to my work. It’s in a different city. Daycares here are charging $195 each week for two kids. I understand my sisters point bc she’s getting up early and driving to watch my kids which is why I’m paying her $300 for 3 days but I am stressed bc I feel like it’s alot out of my check each week but I gotta do what I gotta do I guess. I guess I’m asking what would you pay a babysitter for 3 days? She is saying if I work 4 days it’s $400 so basically $100 a day. I know it doesn’t sound like much but it’s a lot from my pay.",

    "self_text": "Yesterday I heard my partner tell our son (who has just turned 3) in all seriousness that he is too old to cry now. He explained that in Peppa pig she never cries, only baby George cries and now LO isn't a baby he is too old to cry. He truly thinks this is a normal viewpoint to have.  I came in the room and told him not to say that, it is okay to cry.  My partner has always been very closed about his feelings, it is near impossible to get him to talk about them. I don't think that's great, but it is his choice and I try to respect it but also make it clear to him that I am here if he does want to talk to me about anything without judgement. He suffers from anxiety and has had panic attacks since he was 17 (he's now in his thirties), he's been hospitalised due to them twice.  I am very aware that a lot of men struggle to express their emotions and it can lead to serious issues down the line. I don't want our son to grow up thinking he can't express his feelings, especially to his own parents, but at the same time I don't know how to approach this with his dad.  I will add that previously he has definitely made an effort to change some of the ways he talks to our son that I'm very proud of. He does try to help our son identify what he's feeling.",

    "self_text": "Since me and my husband have been together we've always had Christmas day at my parents and then a second Christmas day at his parents on boxing day.   His parents like to be alone Christmas day, and my mum always asks them round for the evening. They have a few times, but have also said no as well. We also always go round in the morning for an hour to say Merry Christmas.  Roll onto this year my partner has said he doesn't want to go to my parents. He hates my mum, which is very difficult. She's very old school, and says things as she sees it. I've gotten used to it, so I'll ignore it. He on the other hand can't, which I do understand.   We have two children together and they both adore both grandparents. In my eyes though if you can't see my parents Christmas day or boxing day then we shouldn't see his parents.   His ideal Christmas day is at home, his parents round and then boxing day round his parents.   For me it's one parents one day the other parents the other day.  The oldest is almost four, the youngest is one in February. The oldest would definitely prdfer to see the grandparents.   To add to the complication I hate his mum. He doesn't know this because I don't think it's nice to say it. It upsets me every time he says it about my mum, and I wouldn't want him feeling like that. Plus if I told him, he'd tell her, and he'd end up hurting her feelings.   I have already said yes to Christmas at my parents, not knowing he was going to say this. So now do I go against my husband's wishes? Or my parents not? Then How do i tell my mum (she lost her sister this year, so it's going to be a hard one)? Or how do I tell my partner I'd like to see family as well as him?   Added:- his mum acts like she dislikes me. She'll always do snide comments and digs at me. I'm pretty sure my father in law sees it though. About a year ago I'd cooked them a roast lunch, she moaned. He immediately said \"well I'm really enjoying it, definitely better than hat I could have had\". Since then she has been worse 😅",

Nice and quiet, no feeding etc.  However, he creates absolute scenes when we are in a restuarant, throwing cutleries, tissues, shouting his lungs out just to get a reaction from us and wants to touch every food being served.   When we take him to a shopping centre without stroller, he rolls on the floor and screams.

She heavily favours the oldest leaving the youngest feeling left out, she will tell both boys they will take both of them up for the weekend then turn around and only take the oldest, which my fiancee finally stood up to her mother and told her that it was wrong. before the mini fridges she planned on buying the oldest a laptop which i made sure didnt happen because we already struggle with his addiction to screens. i have no idea why she would buy young children mini fridges now, im baffled and im beyond irritated that my fiancee actually just bought them and made me feel like an a-hole... i have no idea what do anymore, im so frustrated that i cant even focus on my work, i will probably end up having to pack up and go home, im at my wits end with her mother. theres much more that i need to vent about but i am mentlly and physically drained.",

Sept went really well, but since the second week of Oct,  he has been really struggling.

He has been able to go out to recess and to the gym on his own .  Had a great day yesterday, but meltdowns today.  Teacher is amazing and will do whatever it takes and doesn’t want to give up.  I understand he might not be ready and the possibility of withdrawing him and trying kindergarten next Sept has been brought up.  Just looking for advice or anyone that has gone through this. We have seen our family doc, naturopath and are seeking a counsellor that deals with anxious kids.  Academically he is ready, can be shy socially.  Emotionally he is young for his age.  We have asked him a few times if anything had happened to trigger this and he said No. He told us he is having a tough time because it’s “different”.  Last year he attended preschool 3 days a week..9-2 so he can handle a full day.  If you have gotten this far, thanks for reading.  Just a stressed out mom looking for advice.

    "self_text": "Okay so I'll start off by saying we have a 7yr F and we didn't know each other long when I found out I was pregnant, I think I was more upset than he was, he was an awesome dad during pregnancy, when I had her and since they have a great bond, fastfoward 6 yrs and we've split up a couple times but have been back together for over a year at that point and I found out I was pregnant again, with another girl, roles were reversed I was more excited than he was this time but I hated the way he acted happier about his friends being pregnant than us, anyway we have her and she ends up in the NICU for about a week this did bring us closer together but it didn't last long, she's now 7 months old and he says he hates her and he feels like she's out to get him, he's threatened to body slam here and screams at her. I've gotten to the point where I don't feel comfortable leaving him alone with her and it's making me hate him, I think I was attracted to him in the first place because of how good of a dad he was to our 1st because my dad is a pos and I was the younger one and was always treated less than by him and his whole family, I think this is why it bothers me so deeply because I know how much it fucked me up, I don't know what to do I've been honest with him and he says I'm judging him and he can't even talk to me but it's not like it's only happened once or twice it's daily, today he said I wish you would just fall out of your bassinet and he was being serious, I mean I'm going to be honest there have been plenty of times I don't like my kids and wish they would shut up but hate has never came to mind and wishing harm I just can't understand, I don't know what to do I'm at my witts end and I feel like it's ruining our relationship too. Is this normal? Just looking for advice and wondering if anyone else had had similar experiences and what they did or what happened, also I feel like I'm already overcompasting love under over 7month old over our 7yr old because of this and I hate that too, because it's not fair, like I said just looking for advice or someone who had been through this, thanks.

I’m absolutely miserable. I work in a department of about 20 techs and we each have a full patient load each day. Mind you I’ve been double masking, washing hands, sanitizing everything, and staying away from other coworkers. Well I had made an appointment for around lunch time today to get my ear checked out because it’s giving me severe vertigo. I tell my team lead and he’s like okay yeah that’s fine. Fast forward he tells the other team lead and she goes “why can’t they do this shit on their own time? They get off early enough to go to the doctor after work hours.”   They are two patient rooms down. I hear all of it. We are in the middle of a terrible sick season. I can’t even get into the utc’s down here after work because they aren’t accepting anyone else by that time. I can barely get my kids in who have been non stop sick the past few weeks. It’s just frustrating. It wouldn’t have affected them, yet they made me feel like shit and pissed off. I should have just called in.  Update: well I went to the UTC after work yesterday. I have a right ear infection and bronchitis. Can’t take mucinex anymore since my heart rate is through the roof so I’m drowning in mucus at the moment. Thankfully negative for flu, covid, and rsv. But for now I’ll be dying at home.",

    "self_text": "My son (3M) is having nightmares most nights and is awake for 2-3 hours afterwards. He will wake up crying, I calm him and try and get him back to sleep. He usually calms down after a few minutes but struggles actually getting to sleep again. Today, he told me he was worried about “bad dreams” and I told him mummy is always here. He won’t go to sleep unless I’m in his bed which would be fine if it wasn’t up to 3 hours - it usually ends at 4-5am. I know it’s a bad habit we’ve got into so please don’t judge, I already know.   I should note two things:  He’s had a couple of night terrors a few months ago, he falls back asleep fine, as awful as it is when he’s had one. He’d scream, shake, sweat and wet himself. The nightmares are different, he fully wakes up, cries and says he’s had a bad dream.   Second, it could be due to a huge life change - losing his dad two years ago (he passed from cancer). He knows his dad isn’t around anymore and I know it effects him.   Anyone any tips in reducing the nightmares? I know it’s normal for children to have them but it’s the frequency and amount of sleep he’s losing. I’m obviously exhausted too as I usually don’t manage to sleep until 2am so it’s almost all night if he has a nightmare. Obviously nothing to that it feels like for him I know. Please be kind, it’s 4am and I’m tired as it’s one of those nights",

On one hand I think it’s good to show emotions, specially since I didn’t get that growing up. On the other hand I am afraid he will see me as weak and take advantage of it.

    "self_text": "State is NY. About a week ago, I went to my daughters (2yo) daycare to participate to her trunk and treat activity. The director pulled me aside to ask to speak to me. I got really anxious because I was wondering why she would want to speak to me in private.   She explained that she came back from lunch and saw 2 sticky notes on her desk, asking her to watch a video in my dd class starting a specific time. While watching, she saw two daycare workers screaming at my daughters because she refused to nap. Then, they pushed her back to keep her in her cot and afterwards, they pulled her legs. They also abused another little girl.  The director explained this me and mentioned that she fired them right away and called CPS.  I was so shocked, I started shaking and could barely breathe at the idea that someone would hurt my kid.  Fast forward a couple of days later, CPS came to our house to ask questions and let us know about next steps. They saw the video and confirmed the gravity of what they saw.   I’ve noticed since then that my daughter is super clingy to me even when we get out of the house to go to the car (she would run by herself before). This really breaks my heart.  She has not been back to the daycare since then.   I’m so pissed at these workers because I trusted them! And we would even laugh and joke when I would drop off my daughter.  I’m not sending her back but I’m wondering what I should do next. Sue the workers? The daycare? The director was really nice and was super open during the process, but I don’t understand how these workers felt bold enough to act this way.  What are my options? Thanks for your help!",

    "self_text": "Hi all- I’m really at a loss here. I have a 2.5 year old boy who is going through a really difficult phase. It was initially reserved for us at home, but has recently started in daycare and I am really concerned.   His behavior is mostly not listening, and being outright defiant- such as being told to do/not do something and he smiles and says no, while continuing to do bad thing. He ripped apart two books at school, woke up some napping kids on purpose, and today he escalated to pinching and pushing other kids. I am absolutely not ok with this behavior and am NOT ok with him hurting other children. Kids should feel safe at school, and I hate that my kid is the one hurting them. He is even kind of mean to my 5.5 year old, who is a lover not a fighter so he doesn’t really put him in his place. He’s always laughing/happy/cheerful (while doing bad things) until we get very firm and serious with him, then he burst into tears and we can’t console him.  I feel so stuck. My oldest was not this way. They are polar opposite in every way actually. I don’t spank, but he has gotten me to yell far more frequently than I ever planned to as a parent. Maybe in the grand scheme of things this is “normal” for his age group and he’s feeling out his boundaries etc., but I need advice to get him on the right track, especially at school.   For context- he is definitely smart. He mostly plays with my other son and his friends in the neighborhood, who are all 5-7 years old. He just switched to this daycare 1-2 weeks ago, and was at a different one before this, where we never had these types of issues. Maybe some minor “he climbed up on the table” situations- but no destruction or violence.   Thanks in advance, and thank you for reading.",

    "title": "Child not wanting to leave fun places fills me with intense rage. How to cope?",
    "self_text": "My almost 4 year old boy is a very intense kid. He’s a perfectionist, feels emotions very deeply, and  doesn’t know a stranger. He’s very sensitive to things that others might not be phased by and never able to “let it go” when something doesn’t go his way. Despite being perpetually bothered and grumpy, he’s not shy in any way. In fact, he latches on to anyone who plays or talks with him anywhere we go.   I feel like that last part is related to the fact that he hasn’t been able to make any natural friendships yet. I myself don’t really have any friends and especially none with kids. We have some family with kids his age but they are mostly girls with much more relaxed temperaments than his, so he tends to be a little too much for them but they can play together for short periods of time if we happen to see them at a family gathering. But we’ve definitely never been invited to a play date or birthday party. Yes, I feel absolutely horrible about that.   Any time we are at the park etc and there are multiple random kids, he latches on and gets tunnel vision while playing with whoever gives him the time of day. If a kid shows that they do not want to play with him, he cannot handle it and will continue to pester and bother them. But if a kid does want to play with him, he will do everything that kid does and follow them around.  This obviously makes it impossible for us to leave as new kids come and go constantly. He completely ignores me and continues following the other kids hoping someone will notice him.   I know this is very normal and typical of almost any kid at the playground (the not wanting to leave part). For some reason I still get filled with this intense rage every time and cannot control myself once we finally get back to the car. I get so angry at him and shout.   Does anyone else have this same trigger and have any insight into why this might happen? I know that kids not wanting to leave fun places is so incredibly common yet it makes me so angry. I think maybe it comes from a place of seeing my kid so desperately wanting to be included and feeling sad about that.   Any insight? Tips or strategies for managing my own expectations around this? I know it’s going to happen yet it still makes me so angry.",

Gave him the whole spiel about why we do it, and how it's legal in a bunch of states but still illegal in ours. Can't tell anyone since we can get in trouble. He understood, and was totally okay with this information. I felt like we did the right thing, being open and honest with our oldest son.

I feel like I should meet them alone and vice versa, by alone I mean without my kids when I meet his and I think we should do some kind of outing, meet them in public.

But, in all my rodeos, I've never been to one where the kid actually will full on just change his own pull-up by himself when it needs changed, yet still refuse to use the toilet. One would think if he can recognize when he needs a change and even change his pull-up himself, he'd be ready for the toilet? Right? But he just...doesn't WANT to. Should I give him more time, or start encouraging it more strongly? Any tips or tactics for increasing interest? He has no interest in books (other than to eat/chew on them), and toys don't seem to interest him long enough to sit there. He gets rewarded with grapes (his favorite snack) if he does happen to have success, but that's only happened maybe twice and doesn't seem to be a motivator. I'm just kind of lost on this one lol.",

Why can’t the photographers or even the school just have a TA on the sideline straightening the kids collars or wiping a dirty face or straightening them out for 2 seconds before they have a photo taken that they expect you spend a lot of money on.   I get it’s not their job but it’s one day, I suppose it adds to the charm, maybe, but some of these kids are 4 or 5, even a couple years older and too young to be expected that they still look smart hours after leaving the house.

    "title": "Is it reasonable for a SAHM to put kids in daycare fulltime and still stress all the time",
    "self_text": "My wife and I have 3 kids, they're 5 and 3 and 3. I work full time, she's stay at home. We have our kids at daycare 40 hours a week. We also hire a maid once a week. I work at a job that can afford this, but we're spending ~$90k a year on these services.   This makes really little sense to me, and I'm frustrated because I feel like she uses that extra bandwidth to coddle the kids too much. Instead of sleep training, she would tend to the kids when they woke up, so it wasn't until 2 years old that the twins slept through the night. My wife typically naps several hours in the day when the kids are at daycare.   I see peers who have multiple kids with one parent stay at home who are able to do it with no daycare or maid. I know our situation is a little tougher with twins, she takes care of wakeup and getting them ready for daycare and dinner/pickup. We both handle dinner/ bath and bed, then I clean.   A year ago, my wife started excersing with friends and meeting up with women regularly and helps out with some local orgs for a couple hours a week. (all great things)   My wife is always stressed about something, nagging or critical to me about things not done to her preference or timing. I feel like as a stay at home mom with kids in daycare and a maid, things should be a lot more chill. We both recognize if I had a job that paid less, we'd have to do without daycare or a maid, and we'd survive.   Am I being unreasonable?  Edit for more deets: Well, this gained a lot more advice than I anticipated.  Some more details (without doxxing myself) and answers to common questions.  Our counselor is great, I feel like he generally understands my perspective well and can help communicate them to my wife. But yes, I do think an individual counselor for her and her bring up would be helpful. I've told her 'you don't have to set yourself on fire to keep someone warm' (and our kids are not figuratively cold at all)!  Before kids, we were great, married for a while, both had relatively good jobs. Right before we had our first, I found a really fulfilling job and didn't really want a kid, but she had baby fever. After a long time and intervention, we had one, I still did my work, and she did too. We hired a nanny 45 hours a week and it was brutal. I loved my job (that paid very little) and she had hers (which paid the bills). During this time, our kid was a terrible feeder and sleeper, we had many arguments about how best to soothe/get through the night; there was a several month period where he only slept if I held him.  When the kid was almost 1, she wanted to quit her job, so she wanted me to get a significant pay raise or a new career. I was unable to get a significant pay raise, but found a different but well paying career. At least from my point, I was killing my hopes and dreams to raise a kid. I felt my wife was too focused on our kid, every concern was an emergency. My wife wanted to put the kid in daycare since she was exhausted; I agreed since she was exhausted. A little before this time, she got baby fever for #2, and while we were miserable, it seemed like she'd be happy. Little did we know, soon after I got the job and we put the kid in day care, we got pregnant with twins. We were in a time of covid, so there was definitely resentment on both our sides; she wanted help with the kid while pregnant, I had a job to keep and felt like she could manage.  Fast forward, the twins have been born and transition from nanny to daycare when they're 1yrs, later I get a new job that pays even more. Honestly, I'm not excited about babies and toddlers, but I'm starting to enjoy time with our 5 year old since we can interact/play. I look forward to the 5-18 age for all the kids. I think it's good my wife is getting involved with things outside the house (like friends and local orgs) and considering a part time job, there's much more to life than just parenting.  At this point, the kids are sleeping decently at night. She preps dinner, I'll help out during dinner. We do bath, put the kids to bed, and I clean. I'm still frustrated that it seems like we objectively have all the resources for happiness, but it's never enough.",

He is in preschool for the first time this year (with no previous daycare experience) and we have been getting concerns/complaints from the school that he has trouble during naptime.  It's not that he won't nap, but rather he won't lay still or stay quiet. They first raised this a couple of months ago (along with other things) and we have been trying to address them. From what the school told us, he has gotten better but still has his bad days. They're borderline suggesting we just pull him out of school early, which would be very hard for us and I'm not sure that will actually remedy the situation for him.  We are desperate for any advice on how to get him to lay calm and still. He has trouble napping at home as well (we've only really been able to get him to nap using a stroller or car), but for some reason has no issue going to sleep at night. I think it's because sometimes he just gets so overexcited and it's hard to get him to come down.  I visited the school a few weeks back to observe myself, and literally every other child (out of about 10) had no problems laying still even if they weren't sleeping. And then there's my son who instead of being quiet will start either singing or just straight up yelling. And instead of laying still will either kick whatever the nearest furniture is or just get up and walk across the room.  I've tried music, white noise, calm activities before nap time, everything short of just holding him down. We've tried bribing/negotiating with him but he's also not very well developed communication wise. Anyway, is there anything else we haven't thought of that we can try? I really don't want him to get kicked out of preschool...",

I talked with her teacher and she never plays by herself, the other kids ask her to play.  A friend invited her for a play date recently, her mom said she’s been talking about my daughter all the time and what good friends they are. When I told my daughter she said why would she want me she never talks to me or plays with me or anything. She is ridiculously creative, she would tell stories from age 3 about how she built our town before she was “dead in the ground”. She’s also hilarious and can pull one liners out of thin air. She called me “glasses” the other day. I’ve always been somewhat worried about the future for her because there seems to be a relationship between creative funny people and depression. Im thinking of bringing this up with the school social worker but I know there’s other kids she sees with major issues and she is perfect at school.

Since they got along so well, she decided to start sleeping over more. Now, my girlfriend’s love language is touch; she’s extremely affectionate and says she has been this way since she was little. My son, on the other hand, isn’t usually affectionate. He’s a teenager; it’s expected thought.  Now that she’s around and always holding my hand or something, I’ve started to notice my son has started to get touchy with me. For example, the other day, we were walking through the state park since it’s beautiful in the fall. She held my hand as we walked, and after about an hour, my son started to get closer to me until he was touching me. He stayed like this the entire rest of the time we were there.  After that, we decided to stop at a small restaurant. After I sat down, he quickly sat next to me in the booth, like he was racing her.  Before she went to work the other day, she was sitting in my arms on the couch and watching tv. My son was sitting on the other couch, and I noticed him occasionally looking over at us. Whenever she left, he moved over to the couch I was on and started to ask me something, but he quickly went quiet. I’m not too sure, but I think he was about to ask if I could hold him or something.  I’ve also noticed he’s slightly moodier whenever she loves on me. I get him being jealous; it’s just been us since he was five, and it’s a huge change. I’ve tried to talk to him about it, but he either gets flustered or changes the subject when I do. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to force him to admit it, but I’m also afraid my girlfriend will catch on. A little bit of advice would be helpful. Thank you.",

Surprisingly when she was smaller she rolled “accidentally” a few times from tummy to back but she’s not doing it anymore. Also not rolling from back to front. Should I worry? She also doesn’t like tummy time so maybe she just has no desire to roll to her belly? Advice?",

    "title": "What is your line/limit on different parenting styles?",
    "self_text": "TLDR: some of my husband’s parenting (yelling, not allowing feelings, high expectations of behaviour) upsets me, he doesn’t seem to be changing, do I need to set a harder boundary/ pursue professional help?  We have a toddler (2.5) and an infant. The toddler (T) has a condition resulting in delays, e.g. nonverbal, trouble with emotions and change, some fine motor skill problems.   I use authoritative/gentle parenting. For example, I set what I’d call normal limits (one tv show then done, time to leave the park) but allow T to feel their feelings about those. I stop things like hitting or damage but allow them to cry or be mad at me. I think tantrums are a normal developmental phase. I name and ok their feelings while still enforcing a boundary. T sees several specialists and they’ve all complimented me on my parenting, for context.   My husband (H) is often a great dad - taking T for park outings, splitting bedtime tasks, art projects, snuggling and affirming - but he gives them unlimited TV, any snack at any time, doesn’t follow through on some therapy recommendations, and if they cry about something other than injury, he will tell them to stop, raise his voice, tell them it’s not “fair” to cry over that, and/or get condescending. For example, this past weekend I’m playing with T. Admittedly the toys are piling up a bit as we switch activities. T gets upset (I don’t remember why, maybe I had to pause to care for baby?) and whines/cries. H comes in and tells them to stop, steps on a piece of play dough and curses, then raises his voice to T, and when they’re still upset, starts firing toys back into toy bins, tells me “you should be cleaning this shit up.” A few minutes later he is calmer but says something like, sorry I yelled but you need to listen to me and follow the rules and you’re not allowed to cry about that.   It makes me feel terrible when he loses his temper at T, and it’s been going on since they were a baby. I’ve brought it up many times, he did a few therapy sessions this Fall and got a little better. I have a hard time because while he raises his voice and can get sarcastic or curse, he doesn’t name call or physically hurt her, or cross any obvious lines (or maybe that’s my own childhood colouring my opinion). It’s just…being kind of an asshole sometimes (10-15% maybe? At least 3-4x per week) to them and me, or most charitably, not having much patience. I could theorize about why (sensory issues? Anxiety?His own childhood?) but this is long enough. Because I don’t yell or because I include positive direction instead of just saying don’t , he accuses me of not parenting well.   What can I/should I do? Is this really bad or am I overly sensitive to raised voices? I’ve thought about leaving but would that make the kids worse off in the long run?",

She has been in therapy for a while because we has been struggling with sad feelings and self regulation since some time but recently got very intense. Suicide ideation was coming up often so we took her to a child psychiatrist (by recommendation of her pediatrician).   Dr. decided to give her a low dose of sertraline (10mg/day) and it seemed it help for the first couple of weeks, then she became very impulsive and angry and basically uncontrollable. We believe the sertraline might have caused this, Dr is unsure due the low dose but to be safe she recommended discontinue for now. She is now in clonidine to calm her down first as safety measure, it has helped on that but she still sad/depressed.  I am looking for resources, I would like to understand all kind of treatments and options so I can be on top of the recommendations from the doctor. If the doctor recommends certain medication I would like to be already familiar and ask the right questions instead of just going for it and learn after treatment. I am strongly science oriented person, so anything backed up by science will resonate in my head.  Any books, forums, pages to help us navigate during these dark road?

    "title": "Safety during private tutoring",
    "self_text": "Looking for thoughts and opinions from the Reddit community.  I want to know what's normal when it comes to private piano lessons and what other parents are comfortable with.  My child (6yr old) has private piano lessons at the home of the piano teacher. The piano teacher doesn't allow parents to sit-in during the lesson, which is fine I can understand this. They don't allow parents to wait in the house either (slightly less comfortable), but I can wait outside on the driveway in my car.  When my child arrives, they go into the house on their own. The routine is for the pupil to wash their hands before the lesson, so they do this in the house. Then they go through to the piano room.  From the driveway, I am able to see through window where the piano lesson is taking place.  Now that winter is approaching and the evenings are darker, the piano teacher closed the curtains. However I was not comfortable with being both out of earshot and without visibility of the lesson. To my mind, any private tutor should take reasonable safeguarding measures for their own and the child's safety.  When I requested an open-curtain policy from the teacher, their reaction was of surprise; questioning why I was requesting this? To me it's obvious: safety. I worded the request quite delicately, without implying any personal accusations. Just that I think this is best practice for safeguarding reasons.  I'm curious to know what other parents would do / how they would feel in this situation?  Thanks!",

The issue I'm having is that he is making himself burp loudly whenever he does burp. He admitted to doing it on purpose because he thinks it is fun and funny, and its not more than a normal person burps, so it isn't a medical issue. (I don't plan on taking him to a doctor for this, the kid seriously just drinks kombucha every day and burps normally in terms of frequency.) I don't have a problem with him doing this sometimes but he's doing it a lot, and purposefully out in public.   I'm trying to teach him that there is a time for things, and a time to be polite. He's allowed to go burp in his room or a bathroom as loudly as he likes, so he has a space to go do it in, and if he does it from time to time with his sibling or friends I say nothing. I've taught him how to burp quietly for when he's at home around his parents or at the table or out in public.   It's just so loud every time and I haven't figured out a natural consequence--social pressure for this absolutely doesn't matter at this age. My parents would have made my brother do push ups every time he burped so I don't have that knowledge base to lean on. What would you do?",

    "self_text": "Hey all, At a little bit of a loss as to how to help my 3 year old toddler. He frequently wakes in the night, and cries and shouts for me to come into the room.   When I get into the room, he'll often tell me he's hungry. He uses this pretty frequently during the day as well - I'm pretty sure it's because he knows its one of the things he can say that I don't really know how to deny. I'll offer him a healthy snack and continue on with the day, but at this point I know he's asking it for emotional regulation as well.   At night, I'll get him a small healthy snack, and he'll typically eat it and then go to sleep for the rest of the night.   I guess my question is twofold -     Do you deny your kid food when they say they're hungry at certain times? How do you navigate whether they're actually hungry or not, it feels really cruddy that there's a chance that they're truly hungry because they're growing and to deny them food - especially in the middle of the night when it can be hard to sleep hungry.    How do you handle night wake ups at 3 years old? I hate that he sort of has to yell to get my attention if he needs something in the night, but I can't really find a toddler friendly like \"help\" button or intercom situation that he could use to ping me in a much less emotionally charged way.     &#x200B;  He eats substantial meals at mealtimes and two organized snacktimes throughout the day, and they're a solid mix of proteins, carbs, and fruit & vegetables as far as what I can find are normal portions online if that helps give more information.  Would love any feedback or thoughts, am at a loss for how to better navigate this. It's not every night, but at least every 3rd or so we're having this issue.",

In general I am not in the best health and am on disability for multiple autoimmune diseases.  I have a 15 year old teenage daughter I have 50% custody of who continues to wear extremely strong perfumes that are debilitating for me to be exposed to. I sat down with her multiple times, apologized for putting her in this position, acknowledging it’s not fair to her as a teenager to ask her to not wear strong perfumes like that. I educated her about the science and consequences etc. I begged and pleaded with her repeatedly. I tried to set boundaries firmly and kindly and all sorts of ways.   She has witnessed me many times having to go to urgent care , being taken by ambulance even for severe allergic reactions and anaphylaxis. She will not stop. It keeps continuing and I l am at my wits ends.   Today it’s gotten to a point where I am considering having her live with her father full time. It breaks my heart but I cannot continue living like this. We have been through several family therapy to address this, set up consequences etc. to no avail.   I feel like the worst scum of earth mother for considering this; I am so scared of how this will affect her emotional and mental development and it’s heartbreaking to even think about. We do butt heads quiet often and she is a big daddy’s girl. She has expressed many times that she prefers to live with her dad. The thing is, her dad is older and she is his only child - he is a good as in many ways but I feel like he doesn’t set boundaries. E.g. any time I say no to the smallest thing or try to set a small reasonable consequence or try to have some fun activity planned, she calls her dad to pick her up.   I feel like it’s been impossible for me to parent. I feel like my ex (again, a good person and parent in many ways) completely undermines me and my relationship with her or my ability to set consequences or rules. I have been trying so hard the past few years but I am tired, so tired.   With the perfume stuff (it’s been going on for over a year now) I feel like I am ready to throw in the towel.   Any thoughts, feedback, ideas , support or disagreement(as long as it’s respectful and growth inducing) would be very much welcome!  Edited to add: some people made some comments about my daughters intentions and character etc. and had some questions. I don’t think she is evil or a bad person. I truly think it’s a combination of being a teenager, absent minded, not getting how serious this is and the overall bad situation and dynamic with the 3 of us with her dad and lack of abilities to draw firm boundaries and consequences. The point of my post was not blame but to potentially get some help with some perspectives and my insane guilt and feeling stuck. I guess secretly I was hoping I would get some validation with this insanely difficult conclusion of me drawing some really firm and drastic boundaries (which at this point in time feel like the only feasible decision to move forward).",

But I'm burning out working nights. And if we put the baby in day care, my entire paycheck plus some of hubby's would be going to that, so it seems like a waste of money. So, I'm considering quitting to prioritize my kids and husband.  We've had discussions about me getting some type of certification to get a decent job, but I'm not settled on anything yet. I manage our finances, so I'm not concerned about thus turning into a controll situation with him. He has nothing but respect for me. We're just at the end of our ropes.   Has anyone else taken a few years off working to prioritize family?  Is it difficult to get back to work with a gap?",

Or does anyone have a makeshift idea for a snack tray for this wagon?   I like how compact this wagon is when folded and how toddlers can climb in and out of it.. Also like that it's not at a crazy high price point. It seems like this wagon would be good for Apple picking/zoo/any outdoor toddler activities. My kids are 12 months apart. I'm hoping to get a wagon next spring when my little one is hopefully sitting up.  Any issues anyone has had with the push style radio flyer wagon would be much appreciated!",

My working theory is that my daughter’s behavior is less irritating for me then for my wife and so a) I may experience less stress and a calm intervention may help more than an emotional one and b) my daughters have another strategy to handle me because I am not triggered as easily and maybe because I am the only one strong enough to force my will upon them (like carrying them to the car, not physical punishment). At least the 3 year old also seems very attached to her mother and may also feel a need to “punish” her for not fulfilling her needs. Punishment sometimes seems also to be the motive of the 5 year old.   I cannot think of an easy solution to change my wife or my daughters. I tried to persuade all to take a different approach, but to no avail. But I would like some insight from someone who may have found a solution for a conundrum like this.",

I'm writing because yesterday I kind of snapped and just moved him to our room, next to my wife, and I slept on his bed the whole night. But I know this can lead to a whole new  of issues.   I felt bad in the morning when he said \"being afraid is not his fault\", so he definitely felt my frustration.  We have good communication, I think. And nothing really bad happened before he started waking up. Some weeks it's every day, some weeks it's 2 or 3 times.  I told him this morning that fear at night sometimes means something is worrying him during the day. And I asked him to tell me if he felt anxious at some point during his waking hours. He said no, but he'd think about it.  Any ideas on how to deal with this?  Thanks for reading!",

I knew it would be a struggle for him with so many people today so I made sure he knew I was there to support him, well about halfway through the race I just watched him become overstimulated and breakdown mid race, came running to me I gave him a quick hug and ran the rest of the race with him. There was no turning back for his psyche though and it was all overbearing so I brought him home with me and returned to school with him once the carnival finished.   I just got home and fucking cried my eyes out dude it was so confronting for me to see him struggle so much around the other kids and I worry so much about his future, he knows he's not like the other kids and they know too, they're so supportive of him, no one bullies him and I love them for that but he is only in kindergarten. I just worry so much about him and today was just a big fucking smack from reality that my beautiful boy won't live a normal childhood.  Sorry for the vent I just can't seem to settle myself down.",

The police said it was mutual but they didn’t know my ribs were broken(my fault. I was scared and declined EMS because I wanted every one to go away) the doctor at the ER told me had he struck me any harder I could have died. I stayed with my ex fiancé until he left me when my son was 2 months old (looking back I should’ve left after the incident) When I was pregnant with my son I did cheat on his father. I know this is horrible and unforgivable. I told him about it directly after it happened, I did it out of being upset about how he was treating me while pregnant. Honestly it doesnt matter why I cheated I’m still shitty for it. After I told him I cheated he did get physical with me and I should’ve left then too but we stayed together.  Fast forward to now- we’ve been separated for almost 8 months and my son is about to be 10 months old, and my temporary restraining order I placed on him is lifted (my choice).  My ex tells everyone that I “pushed him over and over and then slapped him” which is not true, he told this to my little cousins (m10 and m13) who I practically raised, and then told them about how I cheated on him, told them I am abusive, etc… my little cousins are now good friends with my ex and play video games with him online and they no longer talk to me.  This incident was the straw that broke the camels back because those kids mean just as much to me as my son. I’ve been working full time and have not received a dime from my sons father and he has yet to sign up to visit his son with the visitation center. It’s just me. After he turned my little cousins against me I am worried that in the future he will do the same with my son.  Does anyone have any experience with this??

They are the only pajamas he wants to wear, and considering we only do laundry weekly, this means he has dramatic emotional breakdowns most nights of the week (I've compromised slightly by allowing him to wear them 2 nights in a row, but after that, they get gross from sweaty sleeps). When he does wear them, getting him changed the following morning for school is like pulling teeth (when typically he takes pride in picking out his outfit & getting dressed!)  I'm just tired of it. 3 weeks of daily struggle over a damn pair of Target pajamas. I'm sure most will just say it's a phase I need to ride out, but I'm wondering if anyone in a similar situation found something that helped speed up the phase, lol. For the record, I am not willing to:   buy additional pairs of the same PJs (he has SEVERAL other pairs of perfectly good PJs)  do laundry more often (I barely have enough time to manage weekly laundry)",

Other than that she has stomach issues and on top of that she is slightly overweight since the lockdown in 2020 (We started focusing on her exercise and reducing sweets in the house to tackle it).   Now to the point, she started mentioning for a few years that kids keep asking about her eye and one of the girls from her class said that she had an 'octopus' on her belly(this happened two years ago but still stayed with her). Which causes her to be sad and self-conscious. I tried to help her to build confidence and explained that she shouldn't be worried about the opinions of others because they are not living her life for her. However, from time to time she is getting very sad and talks about it again. I don't think that those kids are cruel on purpose, she said that they never were making fun of her just keep asking the same questions. She doesn't like it. I said everything to the teacher and he said he will keep eye on her. This is fine because I don't think she is being bullied or something, she is a very sensitive child. I was the same at her age.   &#x200B;  I would be grateful if you guys could help me. How I can help her with it? Build her confidence a little bit more.

When he draws these “scary drawings”, I will compliment him on the details and say “ooh thats really scary, bud.

She 100% understands what we are saying and will comply as long as the bargained food is high enough value to her. My question is - is this an OK method to employ long-term? If not, what else should we do? Her pickiness has basically manifested as refusing meat. I want to make sure she has a healthy relationship with food moving forward and this method doesn’t seem like the most ideal, but we can’t come up with anything else. If she just doesn’t eat a lot at a meal then she will fill up on milk afterwards (we are working on transitioning milk to being a drink during meals but it isn’t going well).",

    "self_text": "My son hasn’t used a pacifier in years.   Quick backstory. 2 years ago (when he was 4) my son started getting emotional about missing his pacifier.   A few days into it I decided to put him in the car take him to the pharmacy and let him pick one out. We picked out a pacifier and on the way out I took him through the toy section.   He found a toy he liked and I said we can bring both to the counter but we can only take one home.   At the counter the clerk and I made a bit of a show it saying how big kids get the big toys and baby’s get the baby toys. I tried very hard to make it clear there was no wrong choice. As expected he ran to put the pacifier back and we bought the toy. Smile on his face, pride that’s he big.   So,  A few nights ago before bed he asked me if I can go to the store and buy him a pacifier.   It being before bed and not wanting to get to into it, I didn’t think anything of it.   The next 2 days he kept reminding me.   I asked him why he wanted one and he said his mouth misses his pacifier and it makes his mouth feel good.   So I tried the same trick. Didn’t work.   He called my bluff and we walked out of the store with a 2 pack of pacifiers.  He used a bit today, then we went out and I think he forgot about it.   Why do 6 year olds start asking for pacifiers? Did I do the wrong thing buying him one and not marking a big deal of it? Any advice on how to handle?  Thanks for reading this far! Happy thanksgiving!",

Mixing whole milk into the formula or breast milk to start getting baby(ies) used to the flavor and to see if they will be able to have regular milk or if we need to use an alternative milk.   My daughter will be a year old this month and I've only just started mixing milk in. I wasn't sure when I could as she is a premmie baby (born at 29 weeks). I've only done 1 oz of whole milk to her formula and she has taken it well. For close to 2 weeks. Everytime I've tried to increase the amount of milk, she will start to spit the mixture out around the nipple. So I'll go back to only one oz. And now I'm seeing little spots of baby acne on her face.  Now I do plan to talk to her pediatrician and I've decided to stop giving her whole milk for now, but I was wondering if anyone else's babies had done this and what they did. Did you switch to one of the alternative milks?",

Like straight up crying because not enough toothpaste came out of the tube.  I love my daughter, and we have been dealing with this for 2 years now. It’s to the point I have to let her teacher know daily she is having an emotional day, when she goes to school.  I’m literally at the verge of a mental breakdown.  I do plan to call and make an appt today with her pediatrician.  This has been ongoing for about 2 years now. We have done deep breathing when angry or sad, gentle parenting, taking things away, and everything in between.   She is smart, and extremely perfectionist (may be part of the problem), and independent (as much as a 5 year old can be).   Just today she cried because her dress she wanted to wear was dirty. She cried because she didn’t get enough toothpaste on her tooth brush. She cried because the cats wanted lovings. She cried because her hoody was in the washer. She cried because her mask was dirty. She cried because her sister didn’t immediately answer her. She cried because she had to wait for me to open a new box of cereal.  This is just in the course of an hour. Weekends is an all day thing.  After school it’s an all day thing.  She goes to bed between 7 and 8. And she gets up at 6:30 for school. Weekends she gets up when she wants, usually between 7 and 8 am. She goes to bed around the same thing.  She is a semi picky eater. She drinks water and juice. She loves Mac and cheese, plain spaghetti, cheese, her snacks, and PBJ. She refuses to try new foods.  She loves fruit and veggies, but will only eat corn cooked.  She eats limited candy, and other sugary foods.  When she is home she draws or practicing her letters while listening to her music.  It gets to the point I try getting her to write out 4 letter words, and she wants to write out Dolphin. She wants to drawn perfectly pictures, and I have to tell her let’s focus on simple things. It takes practice to get good at something.  It turns to full out crying because lines aren’t straight or she can’t do a perfect circle.  If she colors and gets out of line, it’s full on crying.  I tell her I love it, no matter if it’s scribbles or out of line.  I don’t know what to do anymore. I need advice and help",

    "title": "Mom friends when kids are fighting",
    "self_text": "I'm wondering how you all handle conflicts between kids when you're friends with the kid's mom (or dad)?  My daughter is 8 and has had this friend for a few years now.  Myself and this friend's mom have gone from just friendly acquaintances to actually being friends ourselves over the last couple of years and it's been nice to hang out with her while our kids are playing.  Lately, the girls have been bickering a lot more, they're in the same class this year so might be just too much time spent together.  About a month ago, my friend approached me about some things that my daughter was doing that was upsetting hers.  It's nothing major, just typical 8-year-old girl behavior.  I said I would talk to her about it, but she just kept going, almost like she was ranting about some other kid, and not ranting TO me about my own child.  Overall my daughter is a very good kid, but she can of course be a brat sometimes.  I own that, and it's my job as her parent to help guide her and correct unfavorable behavior, but when I mentioned a similar thing that I witnessed her daughter do (not to point fingers but to illustrate how this behavior is common at this age), she said no, her daughter's not like that.  It really bugged me, but I decided to let it go.  Since then we've tried to schedule two playdates, but both got canceled by her (legit reasons, not excuses).  The first time my daughter was sad, a few tears fell but she didn't throw a tantrum or anything. Her daughter was also very visibly sad and kept asking why they couldn't play.  When she canceled the second time, she explained why (over text) and said \"I know your daughter will be mad, but it is what it is.\"  That really struck a nerve with me.  My daughter wasn't mad, she was understandably sad that she didn't get to do something that she'd been looking forward to, as was her friend.  I will never tell my daughter that her emotions are not correct, especially when her behavior/reaction was not inappropriate.  I haven't responded to that text because I couldn't ignore what she said, and I was afraid anything I said when I was mad would end our friendship and possibly our daughters' as well.  If that happens, it's unfortunate, but so be it.  I'm just not sure what to do.  Should I tell her what she has said bothered me and see if there is a chance she will take it well and things will be fine, or is it pretty obvious our friendship is doomed and just let it be?   I am sure this will not be the last time our kids have issues....all friendships, especially as kids, go through ups and downs, and they may even grow apart and not be friends anymore at some point and that's ok.  But if she's already acting as though her daughter can do no wrong, I can't see how any future issues will go any differently.",

    "self_text": "Hi,  My wife and I have five children and my wife is a SAHM. Our line-up is 9 year old girl (10 in April), almost 7 year old boy, 5 year old boy, almost 3 year old boy, and a baby girl who will be 1 next week.  I hate to say this because I never thought I would say this as a parent, but our oldest daughter is really causing destruction within our family. She is very high strung and tries to step in as another parent when either unwelcome or the situation doesn't call for it. Anything from stressing out if we are leaving on time to something and trying to forcefully/angrily corral the others kids when getting ready, to trying to control and making sure the other kids aren't touching things they shouldn't (like a lit candle when it's not the end of the world and/or we parents can handle it). On the flip side, she will instigate a lot of fighting with the other kids, whether by hitting or by just lying/twisting things to get a rise out of her siblings.  She also doesn't have control of herself well, which is probably normal. Things like touching food that isn't hers (or if we aren't ready to eat), to controlling her emotions, to direct disobedience on really simple things (like please go shut the door that you left open).  May sound normal, but with five kids running around, she is almost always instigating or escalating something. It has added so much stress and unnecessary chaos to our family life. Like, extreme. This is my issue, I know, but I've even developed nervous tics due to the stress of it. My wife is stressed trying to figure out what to do and bring more peace into the home.  Oldest daughter is actually with her cousins for a couple of days and things are...just peaceful and moving along so well. And it's heartbreaking. And I don't want to bank on \"she'll grow out of it\" as she seems to be getting more and more stubborn, emotional, and now I think down on herself. I'm sure she thinks she's getting in trouble constantly--and she probably is. We do see glimmers of the really sweet older sister which makes it so hard when she behaves so poorly.  If anyone is into temperaments, she's about 50/50 melancholic/choleric and that is a tough combo...IYKYK.  Thank you for any advice, questions, or consolations.",

    "self_text": "We have three girls, who will be sharing three bedrooms and a living room. I say \"sharing\" because as they've grown, certain toys have wound up in each of the rooms, without any regard as to who they belong to.  I'm about to finish doing up the three bedrooms as their individual rooms, but the toys are EVERYWHERE, and I haven't a clue as to how to sort them.  At the moment I want to put all the baby safe toys in the baby's room, but the 3yo is old enough to play with her 5yo sister's toys - eg, the Barbies were housed in the 5yo's room, but not all the Barbies \"belong\" to the 5yo: grandma gave them a box to share, but when they were much younger, and the 5yo received newer Barbies as gifts.  There are things like all the Bluey stuff, toy animals and dinosaurs of various sizes, books from various franchises, etc etc, that sort of \"belong\" together as play sets, and it feels really odd to separate them out.  I also want to put the \"larger\" multi age sets, like the blocks, train and car sets, etc in the living room, we but haven't the space for ALL of them in there.  So, after sorting out the individual \"non-set\" toys into each of their rooms - what do I do with all the other toys? Do all the Bluey things stay together, the Winnie the Pooh stuff, the Barbie stuff, etc etc, or do they separate out? Or do they have bits and pieces in each of their rooms, which means my mental load is going to have to triple until I label everything?  What do YOU do?",

Don’t get me wrong, my daughter is a very loving toddler. She’s caring, sweet and very affectionate, it’s just with her brother that she’s a little… mean to say the least, haha. She’s getting along better with him and acknowledges him when he’s crying (aka wants to make him a bottle, gives him a paci or goes to him saying “it’s okay baby, it’s okay”) but other than that she can’t really handle him all up on her personal space. Her brother, on the other hand, LOVES being around her. He smiles and coos at her and will crawl to wherever she is, it’s kind of funny to see their dynamic. We do separate them when we see she’s getting uncomfortable with him all over her though.   Has anyone ever had the same thing happen to them? Did your baby ever warm up to their sibling or did they just grow to fight each other for the rest of their existence? lol!

    "self_text": "Hey gang, so we're in a bit of a pickle  Our second child has always been difficult to get to sleep, right from when we were starting to sleep train her. She has a medical condition which means she spews very easily. One of the ways this manifests is when we try to get her to sleep - she gets so upset she throws up. Fast. Really, really fast. In as little as 30 seconds of being alone fast. After 4 months or so of being spewed on and changing sheets, we gave up and have been getting her to sleep by lying down with her. We were regularly running out of clothes for her, me and my wife, plus all our towels and sheets being soiled in a single night. Even with us lying next to her,  she is still pretty prone to getting upset and spewing fairly regularly. We went through the route of dieticians etc which did identify some allergies, and her medical condition.  Anyway fastfoward to now: were expecting child number 3 in a few months. Child number 2 (18 months)  is better at not spewing, but still needs one of us to lie down with her to get her to sleep. This obviously needs to change and the sooner the  better. With the medical help we've had, she's less prone to spewing, and we think she's probably ready to start sleep training again, but we're very nervous to start. We successfully used a (gentle) cry it out method with her older sibling, who is now a great sleeper. We've talked about going to a sleep consultant, but they're crazy expensive here so we thought we'd pick the minds of reddit for ideas  Has anyone had similar experience? Got advice or resources worth checking out?   Thanks in advance",

Girls for some reason got names common among maids in the 1800’s like Ida or Emma. Generally, we picked names  that had a nice sound to it. The given name seldom was to be found in the family.  What names do people in your country or US state give to their babies and why?",

Here, kindergarten is not mandatory, so a lot of kids don't know how to wipe until they're in elementary school (around age 6~7).

This is for some reason a common saying here. Is it also true for other countries?",

I'm not interested in reading about how you feed your kids fruit loops and icing all day and they're fine, good for you. Also I'm talking only about refined white sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, those things, not carrots.   Those who were very strict about sugar when your kids were young, did they eat all the sugar all the time as soon as they were able and become obese?  This argument keeps coming up with my spouse. The research is out there, sugar is very very bad for gut health (and overall health) and probably for the liver. It's bad for us all. I'm an adult, I know this and I'm making an informed, educated choice when I eat a plate of cookies. My 18 month old can not make an informed, educated decision on what she puts in her mouth, so it's my job to do my best to give her the best start in life. She also doesn't know what she's missing and sweet juicy fruit still rocks her world. My spouse insists that if I limit sugar as a toddler, when the day comes that she can eat whatever she wants, she will become massively overweight because of me not letting her have it as a toddler. I tell him every time that I expect that the near-zero sugar policy won't last long, once she knows about it she'll ask for it, other people will feed it to her, etc., but he keeps singing the same tune. And family members act like I'm cruel for not offering my kid poison unsolicited for no good reason.",

We had her almost potty trained at 2 and then suddenly, after my mother-in-law stayed with us, she completely relapsed and stopped trying. We found out that she had been screaming at her for not trying hard enough to go potty and for having accidents. (She is not allowed to see her alone for extended periods of time since then.) We have tried nearly everything with my daughter. We have done charts to track progress. We have given rewards for good potty habits. We have set timers to remind her, and even going the medical route to find out if there is something causing these issues. Recently, she has started going into the bathroom when told to, and then acting like she is going. She then will come out of the bathroom and we will find out that she has already had an accident or she has one soon after. She also will just sit in her soiled pants and not say anything to anyone until someone calls her on it. She then says she didn't know. I know this is a lot, but I'm literally at the end of my rope. She is being made fun of at school and doesn't want to go because of it, and the last thing I want is for my little girl to be hurt. I was bullied at school and know the trauma it causes, and I want her to be protected from that as much as she can be.",

Then he gets there, sometimes clings, sometimes cried at drop off.  And every day he has a blast and is happy at pick up.  Then this summer, his bff switched daycares, and then so did we (not following the BFF, just to a new daycare center). The first two weeks were rose colored glasses and happy drop offs.  The last week the tears and clinging started again.  Wtf am I doing wrong? Bed time is 8-8:30, he is up at 6am and we leave around 6:45. We have dinner and games and books every night after school.  Does my kid just want to hang with us all day? According to him, yes.  We are that cool I guess.  But what do I do to help him either WANT to go to school (daycare) or at least cope until he gets there.

For example, two of his friends have a Nintendo. We don’t want to expose him to it this early on. But he keeps asking for it. I told him we can talk when he is 10 and that his friends have older siblings who are about 10 and that’s why they have a Nintendo. He seemed to understand but I worry deep down he just might still feel lesser because he doesn’t have it? We have an iPad that I take out only for long flights. His friends have iPads and use it every day for hours.   We restrict screen time because my past experience has been that if I let him be on screen for an unrestricted amount of time, it impacts his interactions with others when he’s not on screen. He feels withdrawn and always trying to get more and more screen time and it just becomes a struggle to have a simple conversation with him. So now he watches TV with dinner and 45 minutes on the weekends after we read a book together or do some art together. But today he asked me why he gets iPad only in flights. I told him because excess of anything is not good. But I want to bring this up again and really talk about every family being different in a non judgemental way.   I know this is just the beginning and as he grows older and has more exposure, there will be many such.. so looking for advice!",

I have no license or car and now have to walk and bus in the winter where its -30 celsius and -40 celsius and worse.   Our home is a shitty environment. We have no life so have nothing to talk about and not one person to socialize with. Last time her friend came over she didnt interact with him because she wanted to be alone and he hasnt come back since.  She doesnt listen to me and says no when I ask her to do stuff. I'm pathetic for letting it get to this point  My daughter seems depressed now. Not much to say, doesnt smile much and wastes away in front of a screen. Im making some changes with screen time today but that still doesnt help with my severe mental problems. Some things that may have contributed to this are genetics and being injured on the head several times as a child resulting in stitches.  We are quiet and alone and i am poor and lazy and not having a license and car is really making it hard for me to do more. The only time I can practice is like once a month or less when my mom comes to town. I have to save for driving school and I dont know if 6 hours of training will be enough to pass the test. So if I dont get my license Ill have to face every winter walking- one day soon im going to have to get a fulltime job that pays a little better than Tim Hortons and that will be a 45-60 minute walk in Saskatchewan winter.  I have nothing to offer my daughter but a shitty life of just having enough to eat and just enough of any of the necesseties and then just mental illness, no support in any way. I love her but I fucking suck at this and I am destroying her. I have been fucked up my whole life, antisocial the whole way through and never having proper relationships or keeping jobs.   I am a weirdo at work who doesnt fit in and they only gave me 1 day this week probably because im an ugly freak who nobody likes. I am an outcast and a failure and i genuinely fear we might become homeless one day.  Should I find a family member to take care of her?

The teachers have mentioned only a month ago that he had been consistently struggling with following instructions and his behavior. He threw tantrums and wanted to do his own thing. In that meeting a month ago they recommended I find a behavioral specialist to which I obliged.   Since then, his teacher stepped down and was replaced with a new teacher. Since the new teacher, his behavior had gotten worse. He has started hitting his classmates and the teachers and throwing objects around the room and throwing more tantrums. His behavior at home is most of the time not reflective of what happens at school however now that I am using some disciplinary timeouts and taking toys and tv privilege away, I’m seeing a lot more negative behavior as well.   Today, for the first time, I saw how his new teacher talks to him and it’s very aggressive and in his face. She repeatedly commanded that he look at her eyes and was forcefully positioning him to do so.   I had told the school before that he does not respond well to that kind of disciplinary action. It actually exacerbates his behavior.   It’s a small Montessori school and they are short staffed so they call me to pick him up every day bc of his behavior. Now they are asking me to make his home life a disciplinary environment so it’s not seen as a reward for bad behavior. I’m not sure for how long I’m to keep my home a no play zone for bc of daily bad days at school? Also they have put the onus entirely on me to deal with and provided very little resources or help on what to do. I’m giving them suggestions what to do in the classroom. Like the new teacher and son spending some quality time to a bond. I’m not sure why they won’t try putting him in a new classroom to give that a try.  I’ve reached out to many specialists and they all currently have wait lists. So while his behavior escalates, they are also calling me daily asking me what the status is.   I’m not sure what to do here. Should I take him out of this environment and try for a non Montessori school that doesn’t have a waitlist? I’m very frustrated at this whole situation. I’m a single working mom and have had to sacrifice two straight work weeks because the school asked me to pick him up early. I’ve asked thrm multiple times if he needs to go elsewhere and they can’t give me a direct answer. I can’t find an on call nanny currently that can just come on a whim.  What are y’all’s thoughts and advice?",

    "self_text": "I find it really hard to keep the patience about potty training.  My 3yo toddler is systematically and stubbornly refusing to poop in the potty.  If I ask him where he should poop he says in the loo. He even sits there happily but won't go.  As soon as I put a nappy on at the right time (about 2pm, his nap time), he'll close his door, stand on his bed and poop there. The whole process takes about 30 seconds but the poop comes out in lightning speed and I can never catch him exactly at that second. If I open the door before nothing is in, and if I let it pass it is too late. In the latter case I get him to empty the nappy in the toilet, he finds that very fun but his behavior is absolutely not changed by it.  If I read the tricks on the Internet the next trick is to take him so he poops in his nappies but in the bathroom rather than on his bed. However I tried and he simply withholds poop up until I put him back in the room, he closes the door and just keeps pooping like that.  I regularly read that the first step is to disrupt the association between his room and pooping but this in his specific case also means disrupting afternoon nap routine...  I try to keep a straight face, to be nice and patient with him to avoid constipation but this is getting me nuts. I have been stuck since 3 months at that stage. We tried bribe (worked for putting him on the loo and also worked for peeing), we tried simply stopping nappies (worked for peeing but he will simply withhold poop until constipation risk increases). Nothing works and I don't even see a small steps path towards getting him to poop in the loo. This has by far been the hardest parenting task for me and I now spend hours a day trying to find new tricks but they never work.",

Turns out she had no umbilical hernia however we learned her insides were arranged goofy, pelvic kidney and low bladder. She does get UTIs semi frequently and sees a pediatric urologist yearly. So far, we’ve had no big concerns.   Cut to this summer, I noticed a bump on her groin that would come and go. Initially I noticed when changing her out of her swim suit at the pool so I thought it was temperature dependent. It didn’t hurt her so I wasn’t too worried. I mentioned it at her 2 year check up, but it wasn’t visible, so dr said to take a pic and come back if I’m worried. It’s present much more frequently lately so I did just that and we have an appointment with her ped tomorrow.  Now I’m googling and getting nervous. It sounds like an inguinal hernia, and I’m worried with her goofy insides it could actually be her bladder slipping out.  Just looking to see if anyone has experience with either of these things. How the diagnosis procedure went, if surgery was necessary, could surgery wait until an older age? Again, we have an appt tomorrow with a dr so I’m not looking for medical advice, just experiences.

    "self_text": "Hello, this is very long and complicated, but i am very young and lost, and would be so so grateful for some advice.  Iam a 19 year old girl and I recently under complicated conditions got guardianship over my 12 year old sister. I wanted this, I have wanted her to come live with me for a long time. I love and am so blessed that she is.  I was not prepared yet, I was working on my house and self to become prepared to take full care of my sister but in a rushed set of circumstances I a couple weeks ago got her early.  I have family that supports me, but its up completely to me to take care of her.  But I'm failing.  She fed, schooled, help with homework, get 8 hours of sleep, her own bed/room, has family and friend to play with. Physical all her needs are met.  The problem is me and her. We came from a unstable and very verbally/emiontional(rarely physically) abusive home. However we have reacted differently. A little tmi but when I was in the house I was in the responsible role, cook, clean, take care of my mom, grandmother, step-dad, and sister. I was a failed homeschooling since 14, so I had no contact with anyone other than my family. I've always been a people pleaser(not a good thing) which led to me trying to keep the peace whatever nessary.  Coming from that home has slightly screwed us up. I have of anxiety and self doubt, but the most important thing to my problem is it has made me VERY VERY scared of conflict. To the point conflict makes me have panic attacks and I will most definitely cry after every conflict(not exactly ideal when raising a child).  Now my sister is exactly the opposite of me, always has been she's very loud and extroverted which I love about her.   Before I left I would try to protect her all I could from everything, however after I left she became the absolute main target. While I'm a \"take it so you don't make it worst.\", she does not take no shit from no one. Which did not go well with our abuser. After I left they would constantly get into screaming fights. She also dealt with a lot of physical abuse after I left.   She is very conflict driven and has bad anger issues from the situation.  Now that backstorys over, the point is I'm having a lot of trouble. First off my house is not done, I have a lot left to renovate(its livable tho), and since my sister is going to school and has problems sometimes I wanted to work somewhere nearby so I've quit my job that was an hour away to find work where we live(don't worry I saved up for this and am financially stable enough to stay afloat while I look for new work). So my house is not done and I'm unemployed.   Me and my sister, my approach to parenting her is the gentle parenting. Don't get me wrong I absolutely do not let her run without rules, but I'm just gentle with my approach. When she does something wrong I want to talk it out with her and then decide the consequences(which always depend on what's appropriate for the situation).  And I love her to death but she is so mean sometimes. Some of the things she says is \"at least I have friends, your stupid you know that, mom loved me best, at least im not ugly, etc\" all these she plays off as jokes so she doesn't get in trouble but there always passive aggressive. Then whats worse is when she gets in trouble then she starts to curse such as calling me a dickhead, a bitch(alot) and occasionally throwing things. She HATES being told no to which she will throw fit, first getting an addiute, then cursing and insulting, then mabye throwing a thing or two before I shut it down.  When she acts like this I stand my ground tell her that her behavior is unacceptable and set consequences appropriately.  I truly think I can handle her with time. Out of all the people to care for her I've been the only one to handle her.   My mental health has went down the drain, I was working on it before so I didn't get like this but shes living with me early than expected so it has stop my progress on getting better.   I am depressed, but what the worst is my anxiety. I get up get her ready for school then stay in bed all day, I clean the house but have to take breaks, I have panic attacks alot I haven't went a day without having one in about two weeks. I feel like I'm failing and am just lazy but I'm truly struggling so bad right now. The last two days have been the worst I can't leave the house, I just curl up and cry.   Of course I don't do this around her, once she get home I welcome her, she does her homework, we watch TV, and I cook dinner most nights.  I just don't know what to do to fix this. I'm just new to being a guardian and I don't know how to do this completely. How do I handle her anger and attitude. How do I parent a child with my mental health in the drain. Most importantly how do I handle my mental health while all my focusing is on taking care of a child.  Truly any parenting advise would help I just need some good word of advice.

We are having to go down there multiple times a night to correct her and as soon as we leave the room, before we even get up the stairs, she's right back at it. I've tried laying with her, I've tried giving her some stuffed animals and her bottle, I've tried bribing her, I've even downright begged her. Nothing seems to work. At. All. She is literally bouncing off the walls until she finally crashes at like 1am. Tonight I went ahead and gave her kids melatonin 20 minutes before bed and she also had her normal bedtime routine. It's currently 10:42pm and she is still in full toddler mode. Her dad and I have both been down there multiple times. Her dad is currently down there laying down with her, but all our efforts seem to be failing. I'm not sure what she needs or how I can help her sleep better. When I ask her what she needs or wants, she just tells me she wants to go upstairs and play or she wants to go to the park. And literally every time either of us go down there, she asks to use the bathroom and then doesn't use it. She just plays around. It feels like this is never ending.",

    "self_text": "My daughter is allergic to treenuts and goes to a nut free school. The school is and was nut free for years before she attended.  She is in kindergarten.  Anyways, we just found out at parent-teacher interviews a classmate has been bringing Nutella to school regularly.  The school has allegedly talked to the parents more than once and nothing has changed.  The kid keeps bringing in Nutella and it sounds like the school’s solution is to keeps the kids separated as much as possible.  Regardless of that stop-gap measure anyone with a kid knows that sticky fingers het everywhere so there is likely going to be trace amounts of Nutella everywhere on every surface.  Kids will be kids.  Am I right to be outraged at the teacher and school for allowing this and not informing us?  What would you do?  TL;DR just found out my school has been allowing Nutella in my daughters classroom and she is allergic to tree nuts.",

She barely graduated high school but will not work. Both my wife and I have a toxic relationship with her. She has been in counseling for many years, but doesn't apply what she learns. Late summer, she stole one of our credit cards from wife’s purse and went on a $2000 shopping spree for 2 weeks, before the card company alerted us. Vapes, fast food and clothes (for her and her friends). We did not press charges (although I wanted to).   We don’t know where to turn. Other family members will not take her. I’m looking for ways to get her out of our house, but would prefer her not be homeless or live in a homeless shelter.   If anyone has been in this situation, or has any advice, please let me know. We are prisoners in our home. I have literally changed all bedroom door knobs with keyed locks because she steals. We wear our keys on lanyards around our necks. It’s like prison.",

    "self_text": "My son started daycare in early October, he was just over 8 months old at the time. The very first day we walked in we were a little overwhelmed and I put my son down to chat with the caretakers for a little bit. What I didn't realize was that I had put him down next to a little girl who was very obviously sick (coughing, total snot monster, the works). It wasn't until a few moments later that I realized this. He went to daycare that week and then was out the next two with RSV. Since that time the Daycare has alerted us to positive cases of Roseola, Conjunctivitis, and most recently COVID.  We had a string of a few good weeks (late Oct to early Nov) where he was able to attend consistently. Then on the 11th they alerted us to a positive COVID case in his program. Assuming it would start to work its way through the class, we decided not to risk exposing our families on Thanksgiving so we've kept him out since then. Lo and behold we just got a message about even more cases in the program.  The center has a check in system that asks about illness and fever but it seems parents are abusing the system and just lying. On top of it, the caretakers don't seem to notice until it's too late when a child is sick (even obvious ones apparently). We're paying almost $300 a week and it feels like it's all been just for the privilege of letting them know my son won't be attending that week. He's missed right around 50% of his days due to a sickness he caught in their care or due to confirmed illnesses in their program. My wife and I are seriously debating pulling him from the program and letting them know exactly how we feel.  Is this a normal experience? Am I overreacting here? Would it be overreacting to unenroll my son?  Quick edit: Thank you everyone for the feedback. It seems like the consensus is that we're just a bit worked up about it right now and that this is a typical experience.",

    "self_text": "Bruh I'm in my early 30s and do NOT have the energy to keep up with my 18 month old.  Btw my lovely husband is sober we always have one sober parent on hand in case of emergency.  It was also a long ass day. Toddlers are like tiny drunk people, our toddler is in his \"lick and climb everything\" phase.   ANYWAYS. Dinner goes smoothly, it always goes smoothly because I am the head chef in the house and all my cooking is delicious. Our son eats everything and anything that I cooked. If he pulls some toddler shit and suddenly hates something he ate a million times before, we add a dash of sprinkles and suddenly it is \"magic food\". Magic food is 100000x more delicious and toddlers are the most gullible people I have ever met.  Why I'm high, I get the giggles and the munchies. Our son thinks it is so funny when I laugh when I eat. He wants to join in on the fun and starts eating and then giggling with me.  And then afterwards he wants to dance and play after dinner. We always join because it makes him tired and sleep through the night. I am way more down to dancing if I feel fuzzy on the inside.  Bathtime is easier because my husband and I have a rule. Whomever is high has to kneel and whomever is the babysitter gets the sitter. We hate kneeling on the bathroom floor and take turns, but when you are high your knees don't hurt. My husband will be sitting on the sitter (toilet) more comfy like to watch me and our son.  If you are going to get high, you need to do it responsibly. Just like those who take a glass of wine at night, it makes your judgement not so sharp so you need to be there incase of accidents.  And we do go over weed safety with the kid. Our pantry is like 20 feet long, the bottom two shelf's are alllllllll his snacks. At the very top and in the back are the adult snacks. We go through it as much as possible. Do you eat snacks from your shelf? Yes! Can adults have your snacks? No! Do we eat from our shelf? Yes! Can you have our snacks? No! But if you do and feel funny, can you alert an adult? Yes!  That is the shelf where we hide our Oreos.  We ordered a special size safe and it has been in the mail since forever, but when it comes we are slamming those bad boys in there for extra safety.   I can't wait until our son is a teenager and trying to pretend he ain't high as fuck around us. Or the day he steals our weed and act like he got away with it.   Also bedtime is pretty easy. I'm kinda just vibing here with my heating pad of a kid on me while I relax with him on this rocking chair while my husband reads us a story.   Also psa don't name your cars. My husband and I car name is Tursla and our son thinks she is a real member of the family and wants to say goodnight to Tursla every night. Same thing with Robi the automatic vacuum cleaner.   But that weird little ritual is hell lot more tolerable on Mary Jane.   Along with children's shows and movies on repeat. Ever seen the show Little Bear? Ducky is annoying AS FUCK. Ducky from Land Before Time is a lot more cooler Ducky yep, yep, yep",

Do I have any protections as an employee who breastfeeds?  EDIT: thank you for all the responses.  I think I felt very emotional initially.  I felt as if there was shame attached to the request to have my milk covered. It's hard enough being a new mother, let alone trying to work and pump during the day. I looked into the regulations at my work place and found out that I am supposed to have a fridge allotted to just breastfeeding mothers.  So a fridge will be placed in a spot where they will be making a lactation room. I'm glad this will also help out the two new mothers returning from leave later this year.",

My mom comes over and hangs out with him/us once a week/EOW but she does live about 1.5 hours away. My LO hates long car rides and her apartment isn’t remotely baby proof so I don’t really want to drive over there. The only way it would be safe is if I brought the playpen but he is getting to the point where he doesn’t want to be in it period.   She asks to take him overnight. He is a TERRIBLE sleeper and she’s been heavily oversleeping lately so I worry she wouldn’t wake up to him, plus we cosleep and I don’t want him sleeping in her bed because of the aforementioned sleep. She says it would be different with him with her but I don’t agree.   She asks to take him out of the house without me but moving the car seat sounds like a giant pain in the ass so I’ll have to buy one for her car.   I’m also extremely nervous not having him with me. We got into a car accident in March. He was a preemie NICU baby. I drastically cut my hours at work to stay home with him because we don’t want to do daycare/nanny because there’s too many horror stories.   It’s not that I don’t trust my mom with him. She’s the only one that watches him at our house when we go out but… I don’t know about leaving the house. We’re still breastfeeding too.   Am I crazy for being this uptight/unsure about it? I trust my mom. I just don’t want kiddo doing overnights and if anything were to happen to him and I wasn’t there I’d feel guilty for forever. Part of her rationale is “your grandparents had overnights with you by like 6 weeks” - okay and? You needed their help so you could work. We don’t need that.",

My son gets upset when he has to go with him and can't get to his mom's arms fast enough when we pick him up. But the issue is that it is court ordered and the courts don't care about what the 3 year old acts like, because they say they are easily manipulated. When he comes back for the next week after he comes back from a visit, he doesn't listen, throws lots of tantrums, and at night has night terrors for hours on end. his eyes are shut the whole time he goes through these fits at night, he yells, screams, thrashes, and throws the closest things to him. We have tried ignoring it, talking with him, even trying to snap him out of it but usually it ends only after 2 or more hours( no exaggeration), the longest being close to 5 hours of it, fighting with him and giving him what he asks for only for him to throw it and say he wants it again. I am at my wits end on what to do, both my fiance and me work full time jobs and run on fumes and when he starts to sleep through the night again it's already time for another visit. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

He promised at the beginning of the year to keep up his grades and fil out all the scholarships and work hard to make the best effort to make going to this college doable. He did great the first six weeks, amazing grades on top of working a part time job. His teachers were blown away at the change in him from years past when he literally dragged his feet on every assignment. I was so excited for him and made a very big deal out of his effort and hard work. I never missed an opportunity to build him up. I still build him up every day and send him messages of encouragement. However last six weeks he started slipping he managed to pull two bad grades up to high Cs but still not great for his overall gpa then this six weeks hes all but given up and he says hes overwhelmed which I get but I also feel like hes using the fact that he has a job as an excuse to do poorly even though the job was his idea nd now he has to have it to pay off a car he bought. i hate bursting his bubble but I told him today that he may need to take another look at community college for now. I dont want to bring him down more but I dont know what else to do its really up to him. any thouights?",

    "self_text": "Disclaimer: I have a lot of children, but we have multiple generations and family members in the household. This is the norm for us. I promise they're all looked after and parented. Family is almost completely neurodivergent and we just had an abnormally bad day.  My father in law and I decided to make a nice, cooked lunch today. Rice, roast vegetables, bread. Maybe not what the majority of people like, but my kids usually like it. Usually.   My oldest peered in and told us he was going to sort himself out. He ate ramen.  My second ate a carrot and asked me if she could get something cold because \"I don't like warm food now.\" (Very true; she hasn't been eating cooked dinners recently). She had a peanut butter and nutella sandwich.  My third threw hers on the floor and then cried. I still dont know if it was intentional or just her impulse issues. Her sister offered to give her her food, as she got the sandwich, but that just made her even more upset. She's at burger king with my aunt (and her son, who also didn't want the food).  Fourth saw his sister drop hers and copied because why not? You know. Big sisters know best, obviously. But he actually wanted his rice, so he also cried. Thankfully he was happy to finish number two's rice. He did throw the rest of the food on the floor.   Number five I knew wouldn't eat it to begin with so he got plain noodles in a bowl. He's eating them in an empty bathtub he filled with blankets that I'm going to have to clean later while he screams on the floor.  Number six is my absolute angel of a daughter and just ate her fucking lunch. And then she ate her twin, number sevens, lunch too. Because number seven went crying to my dad who made her a cheese sandwich instead.  Number eight had the meltdown of a lifetime when I tried to give him his lunch. Husband is still sitting with him in the bedroom. Neither of them have eaten. (Edit - they appeared as I was writing this, they are grilling chicken).  Number nine ran away and hid. When I found her she'd grabbed the jar of nutella her sister left out and had eaten half of it. I said fuck it and let her continue. There is nutella on my walls, it was a bad idea.  Number ten had a screaming meltdown and bit me, then cried even more because all he wanted was milk. After milk he ate literally all of his siblings servings of bread and has passed the fuck out.  Number eleven bit his bread, threw up, and then started crying. He found the cream cheese while his vomit was being cleaned and I was busy elsewhere. He's walking around, crying into his cream cheese, shoving fist fulls of it into his mouth. There is also cream cheese all over my walls.  Numbers twelve and thirteen still hate solids so they cried and threw food on the floor. There is so much food on my floors. I'm going to be picking up rice grains for months.  And, last but not least, number fourteen slept through the whole ordeal. Miraculously.  All in all, I enjoyed my share. Both father in laws also enjoyed. My dad pushed it around and then gave it to my father in law. My aunt is at burger king, but my uncle enjoyed. The other four friends that live here also thought it was good. Friends little girl had cereal. Cousin also had ramen, along with sons girlfriend and presumably their daughter.   Now, to start on dinner! (Kidding, we're so tired. We're ordering pizza. I want a nap).",

We live in CT and the weather was amazing today, we had planned a nice walk and lunch to take our daughter on.   As we were getting all her stuff ready I went to take her downstairs and tripped down half the flight of stairs while holding her in my arms. I'm 6'2 210 pounds, there was a lot of energy behind this fall. I manage to pull her close to my chest and she goes for a ride with me down the steps. I make more contact with the stairs and wall on my right side which is where her head was. She hit her head on the wall as we went down. She instantly was crying like I've never heard her before. Her face is deep read from the screams. I'm in pain from hitting my head, arm and back on the steps but more worried about her. We decide to call 911 because we can see a bruise developing on her head, the cops show up first and tell dispatch to step up the ambulance. We get taken to the hospital and go in for a CT scan for her head an an xray of my arm because we think its broken. Thankfully all was OK, no concussion or fractures... just heavy burising. She just has a bruise now and I'm sure a pretty bad headache. She also hurt her elbow on that same side and is very tender to the touch.   I'm writing this now as she sleeps on my chest. I don't want to put her down to sleep. I've never been so scared in my life!  The sounds she was making and the severity of the fall will haunt me. She is all safe now and regular doses of tylenol will help her feel better. But Holy fuck... being a parent is tough.",

    "self_text": "My oldest son (10) has been acting out lately. Not listening to a word we say, lying about even the most stupid things, even (though not deliberately) turning people against one another. Lately, he's also picked up the habit of slamming the doors when he's upset. He is not a kid that opens up easily, so it took his dad and myself a while before we finally figured out what causes him to lash out.   His dad and I split up when he was just over 1 year old. We were severely struggling financially and were constantly fighting because neither one of us could handle the stress. We decided to split up because our baby was constantly caught between the fights and we couldn't go on like that. We're still very close friends today and raising our son together.   I got a call from his dad yesterday. He'd had another conversation with our son about why he's acting out, and our son admitted he's really struggling with the fact that we split up. His view is: \"no matter where I am or what I choose to do, I'll always have to miss one of my parents. Why can't you just go live together again?\".  Right now he's with me during the week and goes to school where I live, and he goes to his father's every weekend. We live too far apart to allow him to switch weekly; he can't get to his school from his father's. He told his dad that he wants to go to school near him and be here in the weekends, but when his dad asked him \"but wouldn't you miss mom more then?\", He went silent and started crying because he's so conflicted and doesn't know what he wants to do. He just doesn't want to miss either of us.   We told him we could look for other solutions after this school year has ended, because we don't want him switching schools halfway through his grade. He's already got trouble keeping up with some of his lessons. He understands that, which I think is very reasonable for a kid his age.   Here's the thing. Both his dad and myself come from happily married parents and have no first-hand experience in growing up with separated parents. I could sell him the \"but you have 2 Christmases and 2 birthdays and 2 of everything\" pitch, but I doubt that would actually be helpful. I am clueless as to what I can say or do to help my kid be happy. He seems to be falling into a depression and I don't want to see that happen to my child.   What can dad and me do or say to help our brand-new teen (he turned 10 last week)? How do we support him in this struggle and prevent him from growing up bitter and depressed?   TL;DR: teen acts out because he struggles with me and dad living separately and having to miss one of us no matter what he chooses to do. We don't have a clue what to say or do to support him.

She has a soon to be 4 year old daughter. My fiance and her daughters dad ended their relationship when she was 3 months pregnant.  I had met my fiance at work before she was pregnant and wanted to date her but respected that she was in a relationship.  Bio dad didn't come around until the daughter was around 2. He went and got married and his wife is awesome. I know that bio dad isn't a fan of me because the child talks about me a lot. I have had multiple conversations with him about this and he still salty. My fiance on the other hand, it doesn't bother her.   Have any other parents experienced this and if so, what are your thoughts and how did you deal with it.",

This morning I heard them playing from the other room, I walked in and found my 6 year old son like pinning them down on the couch making them fight.  He does not have a history of being mean to animals or anything like that at all.  He loved our dog that passed last year, he’s said he wants to be a vet before and was almost in tears the other day when he had to put a worm he found back in the dirt.  But he definitely plays rough with our dogs, not intentionally hurtful but rough.  We’ve had to reprimand him before about being more gentle. So when I saw that this morning I sent him upstairs to separate from the dogs, and explained that hurts the animals we love and makes me not trust him alone around them.  Was thinking of making him stay upstairs for a while until he can regain my trust with them (he’s got plenty of toys and things upstairs) but idk what the best action here is.  Any suggestions?",

She is wonderful and is such a joy. She still gets up every 3-4 hours at night to feed though. And she has reflux so we hold her up a good half hour after feeds. That means that if feeds take 30min and we hold her up for 30min and she takes a bit to settle after we put her down, we don’t get much sleep in between feeds. Also, sometimes I can’t sleep when she does settle because she is a loud sleeper- grunts and squeals while she sleeps.  We still essentially take shifts- me at night and my husband does the days so I can sleep but now I’m going back to work and I just don’t see how I’ll be able to function. My husband is useless at night so we’ve thought he’s going to have to stay awake at night and sleep during the day so that he’s conscious enough to take care of her at night. I feel like we’re barely surviving. I see other families who seem to be functioning better than us at this point- our house is a mess, I don’t cook for us at all- there’s no time- and we don’t get out of the house much.  I see other moms going back to work and surviving- I just don’t see how I can. I thought I would thrive at being a mom but I don’t feel like that at all right now.  To make matters worse, my husband and I are both trying to finish up grad school so we would definitely have more time if we weren’t doing that!! I’m taking a 6 month hiatus after this semester.

I’m 31 weeks pregnant right now (my second, his first) and his parents just bought us a car seat. My hubs was going through the manual tonight and when he got to the part about chest clip placement he sent his friend a picture of it and basically said that he’d never known this before now but had noticed that friend’s baby’s chest clip was placed lower last time we saw them. Friend responded positively, and that was that!",

She is in a new school and very, very slowly making friends, but she goes to school pretty far from home and she spends most of her time with her family - her little brother Sam, her dad, and me.   I know she needs to grow up and have more independence, but I am having a hard time not hovering over her, coaching her, and, frankly, telling her what to do. I spend hours with her every night making sure she does her homework. I make sure she takes a shower and gets exercise. I encourage her to text the other kids she knows. I make sure she takes her meds and spends some time off her laptop.  I am basically treating her like a little kid still, and I don't know how to stop. I email her teachers if she is struggling. I meet with her 504 coordinator. I do all of it.   I know she wants more than this life with her family, but I don't know how to give it to her. If I keep this up, she will never gain skills and independence. I don't know how to balance my fears around her mental health with my understanding that she has to start being more independent.   I have been extremely controlling and strict with Annie in the past. So I am trying to be as loving, supportive, and understanding as I can now. But I am afraid I've gone too far in the other direction, and I'm babying her. How can I fix this?",

The only problem is, they changed locations (same parking lot, but bigger space), and now he refuses to do anything there, deciding before we even get there that he is going to be shy. He sits by the wall and huddles in a ball the ENTIRE 45 minutes. He did this at another class I had him after a new girl joined the class and I ended up pulling him from the class. Because I didn't want to pay for him to do nothing. He has refused any other options of fun classes to do, and I feel like he needs more social opportunities to get over this. I even tried bribing him with pizza, prizes, and treats if he even just sits with the rest of the class. I'm desperate. I would love to get him into therapy but I had his sister doing OT a few years ago and it's... Well... H***a expensive, and we are just barely scraping by. Should I just call it and pull him from the class or keep trying? His teachers try to help him participate every time, but the most they can get out of him is one-word replies. I just don't know.

    "self_text": "This is long, I'm sorry.   TLDR: adult child is not paying rent or keeping up with chores and is making excuses to not do anything productive.   Some context: I have fibromyalgia and the stars have be perfectly aligned when I can get major cleaning done. Child (calling him A) is not currently working or going to school.  Has undiagnosed ADHD (working on getting meds).  We had an agreement that he would pay $500 in rent (less than a 1/4 of monthly bills) and help with mowing the yard, dishes, keeping his areas he uses clean.  He has not paid rent or kept up with his chores lately.   Well, today I had the energy to clean.  He mowed just the front yard and then went to his room while my fiance (calling him D) took it upon himself to finish mowing.  I asked A to go finish mowing and he replied that D was already doing it.  So I told him to go do something productive.  He starts a load of his laundry and goes to him room and shuts the door.   (Little back info: D bought him a very nice computer to learn AutoCAD and use for school once he started, with the stipulation that if he quit, he had to give it back.)  I got upset and told him to take the computer to D's office since he hasn't been working on it and only playing games. He got angry and started arguing that there was nothing for him to clean; as I am vacuuming and mopping the house.  I recommend dusting the bookshelves.  He starts in on how he's the only one that cleans anything and that I don't respect him and his ADHD, and going off on how messy I am.  I get to the point where I can't even talk to him or I'm going to lose my shit.  I just don't know what to do to make him understand that he is extremely privileged and that I expect more of him.  If he's not working or going to school, he should be picking up more of the slack in the chores department.  I'm not asking him to do my laundry or clean rooms that he doesn't use. Just the common areas. But he keeps using his ADHD as an excuse that he doesn't see anything that needs to be cleaned.   Any ideas, recommendations, feedback?  I'm completely lost and just can't handle it anymore.",

    "self_text": "I would like to preface this by saying that I’m not crazy. We’re not crazy. I swear it.   For a week, at randomized times, there sounds a chicken noise somewhere in our living room. It’s a very distinct cartoonish cluck and bawk, short and sweet, not even long enough to properly pinpoint from where in the room it is coming.   We have dug to the depths of every toy bin in the room, and tested every last piece of electronics in there. None of them are chickened themed. None of them make chicken noises.   Assuming it was coming from some third rate iPad game, notifying us to stop ignoring our chickens, we turned off the device and waited.   And we waited.   Nothing. No cluck. No bawk. Just peace and quiet.   For two days, silence, and then: ba-CAWK! It came from somewhere in the corner, where the Christmas tree now stands. There’s no toys over there. We stared, disbelieving and distraught.   We’ll never be free from the chicken noise.   (Seriously though, what f*cking toy is making that noise? I need to find it and make it suffer for its crimes.)  Update: I’m currently sitting in the middle of my living room with every toy requiring batteries and several screw drivers. I am taking their power away. None of them seem to make a chicken noise, but I’m not taking any chances.  UPDATE: The culprit has been found. It’s death will be swift. https://imgur.com/a/7v0qriD  A great and many thanks to u/maceireann for saving my sanity. Is 9 am too early for wine?",

    "self_text": "For the past two months, give or take, my 2.5 year old daughter has had these epic meltdowns. They stem from little to nothing, like fussing her for something she knows she shouldn't be doing.   These meltdowns last for anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes generally, involve a lot of screaming, hitting, kicking, head banging off the wall, and she's started trying to bite walls and tables.   Tonight she had a meltdown, hit herself a lot and hit her head off the wall where she bit her lip, and then bit my arm hard when I tried to calm her down. I've got a nice imprint of teeth on my wrist, and punched me across the face multiple times.   I tried calming her down, telling her I love you and want to help you feel better. She kept repeating, \"I don't love you daddy,\" while hitting herself. I broke down crying, and it was like a switch flipped. She stopped her meltdown, gave me a hug, and started to play.  We spoke to her pediatrician, and according to him, so long as she doesn't break skin or draw blood, he's not overly concerned. That toddlers at this age have meltdowns and it's normal. He said we'll check back in 2 to 3 months to see if things have improved. If not, he said we could discuss a play therapist.   But this cannot be normal, right?",

Following that, we got food afterwards. Her, myself and our boy. I guess her boyfriend called (who’s also a parent too with 2 baby mamas) and was a little irritated that we were hanging out. But he literally went with his two baby mamas and their kids trick or treating. She also got a little tipsy too (which hey i cant blame her, full time student/job), so i made sure she got home safely too. In the past, her boyfriend would get annoyed at all her and I’s text messages too. But its like, we have ZERO drama at all unlike him and his baby mamas. We’re actually proud of it haha. But i mean, does he have a right to be concerned? Im 25, ex wife is 29, i think he’s the same age as her. He seems like a good guy, my son seems to like him, so that im not concerned about. But i think he should also understand how important positive co parenting is. If i was just some guy friend she was constantly seeing, then i can see where hes coming from. But thats not the case and ill always be in my sons life. What are yalls thoughts?",

    "self_text": "There is a TA in my child's  y3&4 class that I really like. We also have a mutual acquaintance completely separate from the school, although I only found that out when she started working here in the summer. Because of this, I know that she is gay, although I'm not sure if she knows that I'm bi. (I am going to be dropping some hints once my order of pride badges arrives).  Every drop off / pick up the TA comes over to me. Primarily this is to cuddle my dog, but she doesn't always go over to other dog parents and we usually chat for a bit too. I know she lives in the same village as I do (she told me) so there is definitely scope for suggesting that we take the dogs for a walk sometime as a stepping stone to something more.  TA is specific support for another child in the class. Y3&4 are taught together, my child is in y4, the child she supports is in y3. If she stays with the same 1:1 then next academic year she won't be in the same class as my child anyway. However, currently her 1:1 sits on the same table as my child, meaning that she sits there too. If it makes any difference whatsoever to the ethics of the situation, my child thinks she's great / she is their favourite member of staff.  I guess my question is: What do you think about a primary TA dating a parent? What would be your concerns? Is there any way I could mitigate them? So far it's all a pipe dream anyway.  TLDR: I have a crush on a TA in my child's class in primary school. Can I ask them out or is this a no-go?",

I remember being in grade 1 and having my parents make a big deal out of an issue and it made even more kids pick on me, and that's precisely why I wanted to have my daughter be able to stand on her own two feet.  We got some great one liners as well - we live in a culture where kids can have some pretty witty/spicy comebacks so I'm hoping a combination of communicating with my daughter about how everyone likes different foods and there's no need to make any changes, the teacher paying attention (her whole grade only has 8 kids and they eat lunch at their classroom table) and then a comeback or two will pull this right back around.  Overall my kid absolutely loves school, so I didn't want anything to mar that for her.",

    "self_text": "My oldest who is now 6 has struggled with sleep for 2 years. We have yet to find a solution to help and I’m convinced no other child has ever gone through this before because everyone is always so clueless.  When he was 4 he woke up from a night terror and ever since had been absolutely petrified of sleep/dark/monsters/ghosts/being alone.  After a few months I sought out a play therapist for him because anytime we put him to bed he had a total meltdown being so scared. He saw the therapist for a few months with no help. I pushed for him to see a sleep specialist and they did a sleep study and it came back perfect. He’s not back in play therapy, seeing a psychiatrist and a sleep “specialist” and nothing helps.   We have to sit with him for him to fall asleep at night which takes at least an hour. But the main issue is he wakes up over and over all night long and we have to walk him back to his room and put him back to sleep which sometimes can take an hour.   I have no idea how to get him to fall asleep without us. He’s SO scared. We’ve tried everything. And he’s 6. I feel like in those 2 years he should have grown out of this.   I’ll add he does have adhd and we do use meletonin some nights. We’ve tried so many different medications I just don’t know what to do to get him to sleep all night. I’m really pushing for some anxiety meds for him because his play therapist tells me he definitely has high levels of anxiety.   Has anyone ever dealt with something like this? I’m so exhausted because I also have 2 younger children. I just want sleep.",

I’ve caught this other kid yelling at her, pushing her, and just generally being very rude to her, and she’ll come home saying that she does it at school, too. I told my daughter that she doesn’t have to be friends with her, but she’s a very gentle and kind kid so easily forgives. The other girls mother took my phone number off of my daughters book bag and has been repeatedly texting me and calling me trying to get them to have a play date, which I already thought was a little strange. She also will come up to my car at the bus stop and tap on the window until I roll it down to talk to her. She always rants to me about how her daughter gets in trouble at school almost every day, yells at her parents, and basically does whatever she wants whenever she wants, and then still goes on to ask about a play date. My fiancé and I have talked about it and we really don’t want our daughter hanging out with this other girl because A.) Her mom is disrespectful of our boundaries and acts entitled to our time and child, going as far as to yell at us for not setting up a play date when we barely have time to do things as a family, and B.) her daughter is mean to ours, and we don’t want her bad habits rubbing off on our daughter.   I always tell her we don’t have time (which is true) because we work opposite schedules and when we do have free time, we do things together as a family. But she doesn’t respect that and gets mad/blows up on us for it.   Do I just tell this woman that we aren’t interested and deal with the fallout? I’m not great at confrontation and don’t like creating tension, but she’s been reaching out to me every day, sometimes multiple times a day and I just find it very off putting.",

Sometimes my toddler (2.5) does these two things and it feels like she's trying to wind herself up for some reason and I just don't get it.  The first thing she does is ask for things that are right in front of her or close to her and this usually starts happening when things aren't going her way. I don't usually get these things for her because I don't want me handing her things like that to be an expectation, especially when she's literally screeching them at me in rapid repetition. I will even walk her over to the item and say, \"look, here is it sweetie\" and she will stand over it, arms outstretched, demanding I hand it to her and like, weeping.  We gladly give her the necessary items she needs, like food, water, and stuff out of reach, but I'm not going to hand her the water bottle or her play phone or a book that's literally right next to her.   The other thing is to make requests for things like snacks or something and then upon getting it, dumping it out on the floor and saying \"no xxxxxxx\" and then when I clean it up asking again for it. Sometimes I've handed it back, like her water, and she'll literally go chuck it somewhere and then ask for it. I just don't get it! I usually tell her after the first time that because she threw the item it was in timeout for a moment, or I tell her when I give it to her the second time that if she throws it or knocks it over it goes bye bye.  Today she asked for tea and so I made her some tea, (it's very lukewarm and only like chamomile or something) and upon handing it to her she literally dumps it out and then proceeds to ask me for more. I tell her no, and ask if she wants a snack, and she says yes, I give her some watermelon and she proceeds to try and knock it off the table, I take it and tell her that if I give it back and she tries that again it goes bye bye. She does it again and I take it away. She cries and asks for more random things and I tell her we're just going to take a break from things for a minute so she can relax some.   Literally at this exact moment she is taking her play phone and saying \"no phone\" and then placing it out of her reach and saying \"mama no phone\" and just getting crazy upset. Wtf is happening.  I just don't understand what the underlying thing is here. We are frequenters of Janet Lansbury and we also read Jamie Glowaki but I just don't quite see any tips of what this could be.

I am considering coming up with alternative consequences but I need outsiders to tell me if I am being soft or not. Also no one was hurt in the school incident (not sure if that matters).",

I teach the kids one of many choices, approved curriculum the school allows, the teachers grade, set up state testing, pay for all school relayed curriculum but not physical education. That's on us to pay for.  I've been overweight since my second child was born. I had them too close together and it messed up my body. Pre pandemic the goal was to put them in school and take 2 years to get my body back to health. I was a size 6 when I was married at 24. A size 10 after my second kid. Now I'm a size 16, presently. Covid did not help.  The plan was when my 2 kids got to K and 1st grade. I would spend a year just on me. I had made so many sacrifices to my health for everyone else's benefit, including my extended family who were horrible abusive people to me (not husband). All out of my life now though. Dead or cut off. Which is why my health is important to me. I spent years repairing my emotional damage but can't get to the physical damage.  I have done Noom on and off the past 2 years, and it worked but I always felt starved and only could lose 11 pounds and hit a plateau by 3 months thay couldnt be broken. No amount of cooked or raw veggies tasted good when the \"red\" foods were all the dressings and peanut butter. I've tried green tea, Garcina Cambogia, for appetite suppressants, coffee worked best but gave me horrible heart burn.   In the past my doctor suggested Alli but it's expensive! Almost as expensive as a oersonal trainer and nutritionist by the end of the year. Many people who go off of it also gain the weight back.  Currently homeschool takes up all of my time and energy as well as staying on top of my household duties and a weekly spiritual service on our home on Saturdays. I cherish it. I know if I out my kiddos in public for one year I could lose the weight I want and be so much happier with my life in general. I'd also bring the kids back to homeschool the following year once I got a solid schedule worked out for myself. But right now it's November, I'm fat, unhappy, have no family to help, can't hire a sitter, and a husband who works full-time as he's the owner.   I spend a ton of time homeschooling. Which leaves the rest of my time, trying to find time, to exercise and meal plan... that it ends up never happening because if my other responsibilities. Something has to give. What can I do?",

At the same time, without going into many details, he was involved in some legal troubles prior to us dating. They are still ongoing. I was fully aware from day one, my only condition was that I would not allow myself to get too enmeshed in his problems, but I told him that I would be there to support him. I just didn’t want to be involved in the details (example: not going to his court dates, etc)   Ultimately he could be looking at prison time depending on how his next court appearance goes. He has a good lawyer, so he’s been hopeful. But since I learned that I was pregnant, I started to feel that his problems were now my problems and most importantly, my daughters problems. So I started going with him to talk to his lawyer (he asked me to) and asking questions, I started doing research on what we should expect from the trial, and basically educating myself on what the outcomes could mean for my kids future. And with that, he became more dependent on me and seemed to take on less responsibility.   All of this has made me feel regretful. Not for my daughter, but for the choices I’ve made. Not for myself, but for her. My biggest fear from day one was bringing her into a world that wasn’t good enough for her, but I chose to believe in him and in us together as parents. I chose to bring her into this world, and I chose the wrong person to do that with. I truly believed that we would work together and be a team for her. I worry now that he will not pull his weight, and I’m worried what coparenting will look like for us. I don’t understand how he could do this to HER.   Now I feel like I’ve let her down before she’s even born.   Everyone around me is angry at him for betraying me, but I feel nothing. Nothing for myself at least. I’ve cried once, and that’s only because I feel so horrible for my daughter. Everything that I thought I had figured out for her is gone in an instant. A stable happy home to raise her in (he just bought a house that we were in the process of remodeling and moving into), two parents that love her and love each other.. it’s all just gone. I’m so scared that one day she will resent me for bringing her into a broken family. His family is very supportive of me and want to be a part of her life, however my own family has not supported me since they learned I was pregnant. I’ve struggled with accepting that, however he reassured me multiple times that he would always be a safety net for us.   I don’t know if I’m still processing it or what, but all I feel is hurt for my daughter. I don’t know if I will wake up angry tomorrow, or next week, or at all. And I know that deep down, it will all be okay because she has plenty of people that will love her and make sure she’s taken care of. And I know plenty of people who are able to successfully coparent even after a bad separation. I try to be hopeful, but it breaks my heart.   I’m not really looking for advice, although good advice would be greatly appreciated. Mainly just looking to scream this all into the void and hope that it’ll help me get out of this numb state of mind where I feel so lost.",

He has not been in touch with our daughter, who has since forgotten him. I have never tried to stop connection, only encouraged it but to no avail, which I have settled with and daughter, my new partner and I, have a nice little routine going. However I have got a message out of the blue, that exes new partner has been talking with him and they think our toddler should meet her newborn sister. I of course believe they should meet, but I’m not sure if this is too young to grasp or meeting the baby without the father will be too confusing? Especially because the new one is very small and newborns don’t exactly interact. Going to be consulting psychologists on this as we have a strong mental illness history on both sides of my daughters family and I’ve been doing everything I can to build resilience and set her up as best as I can, and to her bio fathers credit he has always been the same way.",

    "self_text": "Flip a coin on bath night, and those are my odds on a calm and collected time. Tonight was not a good night.  We got in the shower, got all soaped up and washed off, and the problem started when I had to brush his (3) hair. I get him not wanting his hair brushed, and I've used all the different brushes ans combs, and found 2 that kind of work, but only when his hair is wet.  I get the detangling brush through just fine, but there's still naps and knots I want to work through, so I take a curvy comb, and start gently working it through his hair. And it was fine until I got to one stubborn nap, then he had a problem because my only other option was a short toothed pick.   Then the screaming starts. The constant yelling of  \"NO!\"  Which devolves into hysterical crying. I give him a minute to breathe, he stops crying, I tell him I'm almost done, which I was, and he was calm for another 15 seconds of me combing his hair. Then he wants to sit down, but he doesn't  actually  want to sit down, he wants me to sit down so he can stand up, and he's tall enough to where I can't properly brush his hair if I'm all the way down and he's standing up. So I have to get back up, and then he immediately sits back down.  This goes on for a few minutes, with me managing to get in a few more good brush strokes, until his hair is \"good enough\" for me. (He certainly doesn't care)  So now we have to put the lotion on. I would skip this step entirely if I could, but he's got eczema, and will break out terribly if I (we) don't moisturize.   He sees the lotion coming and immediately starts up his screaming and crying, snot nosed routine. He knows this will bring his father running, which will inevitably start an argument between me and his father, thus he can delay the action he wants to put off for a little while. I'm not in the mood for the argument, so I just carry on the lotioning while he face plants into the bathroom rug, still screaming  \"NO!\"   The argument happens (because of course it does😮‍💨) and I'm still trying not to lash out and spank my child. I'm trying to do better, violence isn't the way I want to handle this.   So I give up. He's got the lotion on anyway, now he's insisting that he doesn't need to put his underwear on. Fine. He can sit on the floor and do whatever it is naked 3 year old boys do. And he does. For 24 minutes. I sat on my bed and read my book while my toddler rolled around on the floor, picked at lint in the carpet, and played with his favorite body part. Every so often, I would ask if he was ready to put his underwear on, and his emphatic \"No!\" eventually tapered off to a \"Mama, I need to brush my teeth.\"  \"Well, you need to put your underwear on.\"  \"Okay.\"  Underwear is on, teeth get brushed, pajamas are on, he's in the bed, pretending like he's not tired (which I know he is because otherwise the tantrum wouldn't have happened in the first place).   My question is, was I really wrong for how I went about it? He didn't want to, but it needed to be done, so I did it anyway after making sure he wasn't going to either do it himself or help me do it.",

    "self_text": "So, first off. Growing up I did not get an allowance.  You did your chores if you wanted any “freedoms” over the weekend.  If your chores were done, you got to hang out with your friends. If you wanted to go see a movie, mom and dad would just give you $20 as long as you “deserved it” (good behavior, good grades, etc)  Also my fiancé and me have differences of opinions. The girl wants money for keeping her own room clean and folding her own laundry, I don’t think so. I don’t think payment for grades should be extravagant either.  We asked her to make a list and what she thinks is “fair” and if she did everything on her list every week, it would add up to over $100. We are raising 5 kids and I’m not about to be giving $2k a month for stuff I did for free.  She is already spoiled. We do so much as a family and give her a generous amount for “extras” I’m not giving her $5 a day for making her own bed. Mostly because that’s not even something I care if she does. I used to get beat for not making my bed before leaving for school even though it usually wasn’t made because I would run out of time trying to get myself and my siblings ready for school, she doesn’t do any of that. I don’t want to call her delusional, but she really thinks her “work” is worth more than it is.  But I also know giving her an allowance would give her initiative to do things she’s supposed to be doing without asking her 100x. My idea was to have a checklist and if 100% is done for the whole week, $50 max. And it would have to be done without me asking her.  If 1 or 2 things aren’t done $25  Things like trash taken out, laundry put away the day it’s washed. I wash and sort and out piles on their beds for them to put away where they see fit, if they want to shove it all into a drawer then so be it, be wrinkled I guess, you wear it so I don’t care Usually she waits till she goes to bed and moves it to her chair and then the next morning she makes a tornado out of it while getting ready for school.  We’ve already had the discussion that I will do 1 basket of laundry for the week so she better make sure she only has her dirty clothes in it and not the clothes she was too lazy to put away   She hates this idea saying she won’t get paid for the things she does do if we dock her points for everything she doesn’t.  She thinks she should get $20 for cleaning the bathroom. But she only does the tub (I do the toilet, the other 3 kids wipe down the counters/mirror and sweep/mop the floor)  she wants $10 for the 2 nights a week she takes the trash out.   And then If I pay her I have to pay the other kids (10,6&6) My fiancé says to do that and make them pay for their extras. But I’m a big believer of giving kids age appropriate chores and there’s no way the twins would even make enough to pay for their”extras”  I don’t think he realizes how much of a headache this is going to be. We really don’t ask them to do much. But I’m also tired of beating a dead horse.  Baby 5 is due in a couple months and I won’t have time to be the chore police. Help",

    "self_text": "Hi, how can I help my son become more comfortable with himself and being around others? His teacher described him as \"immature for his age.\" He's very uptight and rigid, e.g. absolutely terrified of breaking rules. He tends to carry his body in a very tight manner, never really looking very relaxed.   He also doesn't like being called out--he recently stopped playing four square because he doesn't like the conflict of people telling him he's out (when he doesn't think so). Most kids would just argue back.  I absolutely cannot find a therapy service that isn't insanely expensive or heavily waitlisted (usually, both). Are there any recommendations for online behavior health therapists?  One example, I bought this \"Little Talk\" card game and one question \"What's an emotion you have trouble expressing?\" (not verbatim). The answer was surprising: He said that he finds it really embarrassing when everyone is cheering for him, and even got a little weepy.  I'm surprised. I wasn't the most social kid growing up, I have ADHD and social anxiety. But I don't recall being out of it. He also doesn't seem to have ADHD symptoms, he seems to be good at multi-tasking and focusing.  How can I get my son to warm up around people?

    "title": "We are resenting have a child",
    "self_text": "Not my main account and English is not my first language (apologies for any mistakes).  The story: My wife and I decided to have a child and she is now 18 months.  Since she was born, she would always scream for no apparent reason (we would check for hunger/thirst/ diaper/ tired/ wanted to be comforted etc..) . After trying to do our best to soothe her, I came to the realization that sometimes she is going through something and we cannot understand what it is, but we can only try to comfort her until it passes.  It was understandable as a newborn, but now it's gotten to the point that we need to take turns being with her or we both break down. My wife and I are both calm and gentle people, we never raise our voice to each other , even when we have arguments it's always civil and constructive. No raised voices, no shouting. We really don't know where this behaviour is coming from.  There are good days and bad days (which sometimes turn into bad weeks). On a good day, she is incredibly sweet and playful. She loves to run around and dance, she laughs all the time and wants to play and read books. Unfortunately these days are not the norm. This is what the norm looks like:  - anytime there is a diaper change, she will scream and try to flip to a sitting position. A diaper change can take up to 15 minutes if I decide to wait that she will let me change her. Sometimes I don't have so much time and I have to gently restrain her so that I can do the job  - most times she needs to eat, she will refuse to eat and scream. She is now also refusing to sit in her highchair, the moment she is inside she will start screaming until we pick her up. Same thing with the bib, she will scream and try to rip it out and if we don't remove it ourselves she will have marks on the neck from the pulling  -anytime either of us goes outside her field of vision, she will scream until we come back. if I'm alone with her, I will have to bring her with me to the toilet or she won't stop screaming (it's fine if she's with only one of us but she cannot see us leave)  -she hates the pushchair and after a few minutes of sitting on it (depends on the day, sometimes we cannot even make it out of the building while sometimes can take longer) she will start screaming and try to get out of it. She can walk but she doesn't always want to. If we ask her to walk, she will scream until we pick her up. Most of our walks become very unpleasant very quickly.  On these days, I don't enjoy spending time with my daughter and I cannot wait for her nap time or for her mother to take over. I feel like I'm watching a ticking bomb that might go off anytime, and it's exhausting. I'm constantly trying to anticipate her needs so that I can avoid a meltdown, because when it happens she is very hard to soother, and most of the time nothing helps. We just have to hold her and do what we can until she decides that 30 minutes of constant screaming are enough and she will stop.  With my wife, all we talk about is how hard life is , and how unhappy we feel since the baby was born. She thinks everybody goes through something like this, but I disagree. I cannot believe people would have 2, 3 , 4 or even more children if each one would basically just scream in their faces most of the time.  I guess I mostly needed to rant, but can anybody also tell me if this is normal?  I know it will eventually pass, but it feels like the most unrewarding job in the world. We were planning on having 2 kids when we started talking about family, but we have now decided against it. Neither of us wants to go through this again.",

Thanks 😊  Edit:  Thank you for all who took their time and reply!  I was not expecting that much controversy. We are not from the US, so cultural diffrences might play a role in that aswell. As our kids quiet happily share pretty much everything about their body's and periods, it's not a privacy issues for us. They do tell us when they get their periods, sometimes it would be nice to be a step ahead though.  We had two incidents in the last 5 days where one went away with Basketball. (She got asked if she needed to take supplies which she denied. A few hours and a phone call later I was on the road delivering a new set of undies and supplies. Supposedly she couldn't remember when her last period was and just was too excited to leave for Basketball in the morning to stay and take supplies.) Other daughter came home crying from school yesterday because her best friend wasn't talking to her as much. And it was the end of the world. When she got her period this morning it made it a lot easier for us and her to understand why she was so emotional. (We are not here to dismiss every emotion and possible mental health issue  just because they are on their period, but sometimes it gives us a perspective. )  So in short, if we as parents know that they are about to get their period we can help them navigate through it, be it managing their emotions, making a comfy weekend at home instead of going to the beach, and having all the supplies of they are going somewhere (Especially the younger one)   When I was younger I used a calendar, but now using an App on my phone for my own period and was just wondering if there was something out there that would let me add my daughters aswell",

He's a physical presence in the house and seems to be very little else at times.  Seeing him miserable in his job and never really doing anything which involves having a spark or lust for life for so many years has taken it's toll. I've moved through wanting to help and support him, to doing things for him and now I just feel totally powerless, nothing changes anything. Even talking about it feels totally totally pointless.  I know he may be depressed, and may have always been. I'm at the point where I feel like I'm bad for him and he's bad for me.

He's a really good dad and in terms of parenting were on the same page. Though having the kids has obviously made the difference in effort become more obvious.   I really want him to be happy, but I don't think our current situation is making him happy. Or me really.  I wish I could make this better but I am totally and completely at a loss. Any advice?",

    "self_text": "We allow our kids to watch a small amount of TV/video per day (30 min, while I'm cooking dinner).  Currently, they watch it on an iPad (10\" diagonal).  However, because of the small screen size, they have a tendency to put their faces all the way up next to the iPad.  To minimize eyestrain, I think we need to buy some sort of screen that's a little bigger.  We don't have a traditional TV in our living room, nor do we want one.  This TV/tablet/monitor will be stowed away in a closet or under the couch when not in use.  Any suggestions on portable TVs or tablets that are big enough that the kids can sit a little further away?   E.g., 16-24\" screen (big enough that it doesn't cause eyestrain, but small enough to store away under couch when we're not using it)  Built-in battery that lasts for 30+ minutes (no cords to trip over)  Basic streaming functionality (YouTube, Amazon Prime, Netflix, Disney, etc)  Touch sceen not necessary (and probably cheaper without it)  Durable is a plus, but not strictly required",

Is it possible to set a boundary without the toddler trying to escalate the situation? Ex: telling them not to do something is met with them yelling \"stop\" or \"leave me alone\" in defiance, and has even hit their parents in response.   I also would like to know if this is normal behavior for a 3-year-old and if they'll grow out of it? My experience with this child is the only personal experience I have with children, so I don't know.  Edit: For #2, I'd also like to clarify that I meant for the duration of their meal, meaning however long they take to eat until they're full, regardless of if it would take the same amount of time as an adult or not.",

My beautiful son is 21 months, has always been completely healthy and met milestones, etc. He sleeps with us and has since 6 months old. He was nursed to sleep until 19 months( Sept 3rd was our last session).  Lately, like the past week or so he throws a raging tantrum every night when we try to put him to sleep. He won't go to sleep until 11 or 12 midnight and that's after his normal routine of books, milk, and then an attemp to sing or rock him to sleep which ends in a screaming hour long tantrum and then us usually leaving the room and watching a show with him until he falls asleep.   We've tried feeding him more closer to bed, starting bedtime later, doing longer routine, dim lights, the singing and rocking as we've done forever.   Oh also, he won't let us sing the same songs so we tried switching that up, but as soon as we turn off the lights he screams to leave the room and won't stop until we do.   We did buy a house recently, a week after he weaned and he started sleeping through the night which was amazing. Mybrother's family moved in three weeks ago and they are all in bed by 830.   We have routines, outside time, plenty of play, I just don't know what else to do, but my husband and I are on the verge of mental breakdowns.   I know tantrums are normal, but he doesn't seem to be getting enough sleep and we aren't either and now it feels like every night is a struggle. He also often is waking early, sometimes 5am. We are so tired and at a loss.  Thanks for reading. If you have any ideas, we're open to hearing rhem.",

I understand that installing a car seat is a pain in the ass, and I still feel like he should have a car seat (along with the 3lb, removable booster) for his car. Typically, this only causes issues once or twice a week, but 3-4 times a year causes a safety issue that has in the past prevented me from going to the hospital when I need to.  Since there is no changing his mind, we don’t argue about it anymore, but it still bothers me. Am I missing an obvious solution?

She's been sick but we thought it was just her normal stomach aches, besides between my youngest daughter's birthday and the million Halloween parties there's just been lots of food. She was feeling a little bit better last night but it got so bad in the morning. Peritonitis. How did that even happen? I took her to the hospital immediately, it was so bad to see my girl crying and asking me to make it stop while i couldn't do anything. I also kept having a hard time communicating with the doctor, my English is still really bad, specially when i'm nervous. And i also kept having the feeling that they were hurting her when doing the tests, i don't know. In general i feel like i've been failing her a lot lately, specially today.  I'm still at the hospital trying to figure out childcare for both my youngest, who were also really scared and worried about her. For now they're with a neighbour but i'll probably spend the night at the hospital so they need somewhere to stay. Her dad just won't pick up the phone, as always and my husband is out of town (althought he is obviously on his way now) and it's always hard to keep in touch with my close friends due to timezones. It's also my other daughters birthday in a few days too so everything is stressful.   My daughter will be okay or the doctors said that at least and i got the chance of talking to her when she was awake (she kept saying how she can't have a scar because she loves wearing crop tops) so it makes me feel okay that she was in a good mood but i'm just terrified. She should be with her friends now, i feel so guilty for not noticing that something was wrong before, it's as if i was the one that made her go through all that pain.  I guess i just needed somewhere to vent. As i said i'm alone now and i obviously have to be okay for her.",

    "self_text": "I'm feeling so upset and angry. I don't know what else to do. I have a 10-month-old daughter. Tonight, I told my husband I wanted to get some homework done since I attend full-time college online. Our household had COVID these past few weeks so we have been all sick, and my grades show that. I've been spending most of the day at the pharmacy picking up his prescriptions and then came home, tidied up, and made dinner for him since he hasn't been eating due to being sick. I'm still not feeling well, either, but trying to push myself. I told him I was finally going into our bedroom to concentrate on my schoolwork. He's been playing his video game all day (however, I gave him a small list I needed help with and he did most of it) and he let my daughter keep crying and being fussy. He puts her in the small play yard while he sits in the office and plays his game with 'the boys'. She was constantly screaming because ya know, she is sick and teething. My husband is well aware of this. He kept yelling at her and kept telling her to stop, while he is playing Call of Duty. I told him to stop yelling at her and that babies do not understand yelling and it literally does nothing. He still continues to yell at her. I told him I need to get my schoolwork done, and he tries to keep her quiet but keeps getting mad at her. He came into the room after 20 minutes of trying to calm her down. I told him to try different techniques and he was very upset. I told him, \"do you just want me to quit school then? I can't seem to get anything done\" and he stormed out and slammed the door. 10 minutes later, she was still fussing and I grabbed her and calm her down. 40 minutes later, he comes into the room and offers to take her off my hands and he is calm. I told him don't worry about it if you're just gonna sit there and yell at her\". He said since she was calm and had her toy, he can take her. This is a constant occurrence, it's not a one-time thing. I'm at a loss.  To be fair, we are going through a very stressful time right now. We are struggling financially and he had to get a new job (he started his own business after he got laid off. We lost all of our income and probably going to go through bankruptcy shortly). I try to give the benefit of the doubt, however, it seems like he is such a negative person and I try so hard not to let it get to me. It's draining being around him sometimes because he sucks all my positive energy out of me. I applied to universities since I want to further my education and not work at dead-end jobs. I'm currently in community college right now, but I plan to transfer to a 4-year college. I got accepted into 2/4 I applied to, I'm just waiting on the other 2. All he really said was \"good job\". I bought up why he didn't seem excited for me. He said \"well, I don't really want you to go to college.\" I asked why, and he said, \"I just know it will be hard for you\". I don't really understand what he meant by that. I will probably do online school, but deep down I really wanted that \"college experience\" of living in a dorm, etc. I know it isn't realistic and having a daughter now too makes it harder. However, I feel like he is holding me back and I'm overall not a happy person anymore. I don't know if it's just the stress of everything getting to me and adding this, or if I truly feel this way.  I do feel alone all the time. I don't have many friends who live in my area, so I feel like I don't have many people to talk to about this. I feel alone because when he's not working, all he does is play video games and talk to his friends online. I'm at home by myself with my daughter and my two dogs all day while I do household chores and homework, and I ask him to spend time with me but he always has a tournament to do and plans to play his game. He listens to me some of the time, but it's usually late when he comes into bed and watches TV with me. I feel like we are just roommates at this point. I understand that he wants to relieve stress and that gaming is a hobby of his. I like to play games too when I have the time. However, I always make sure my daughter is taken care of and not just sitting in a play yard for hours at a time. I suggested therapy, and he kept saying \"I guess\". I go to therapy because I have bad anxiety, and now narcolepsy so I thought it would be beneficial for us. He doesn't seem to have any motivation to fix our relationship, or even how I feel. I let him know my feelings, and nothing changes. I am tired of nagging him, I feel like I'm taking care of a man-child.  Sorry about the long post. It was a lot longer than I had thought lol. I just needed to get it out and type it out I guess. Thanks for reading if you made it this far!",

Always at each others houses, and always together. Naturally me and C became friends aswell and we formed a friend group with 2 other mums aswell.  We all did alot together but A and B were the closest friends in the group. Back in September A came up to me and C and told us that B had been bullying her. B had been name calling and hit A twice and had told others not to play with A. This was backed up by another child who B had told not to play with A anymore.   I trusted C to deal with this as we were, to my knowledge friends, and had a basic understanding of each others parenting styles already since we're neighbours and always at events together etc.  The next day C barely spoke to me I just figured it was abit of shock because no one wants to hear their kid is being mean to others. A few days later C leaves the group chats we had. I continued to try and talk and act as normal as the kids had at this point had gotten over it and were friends again.   We're now in December C refuses point blank to even speak to me, whenever A goes to see if B wants to come play there is always an excuse for B not to go out or come over to play. The rest of the 'group' have started being weird and icing us out aswell to the point where it took one of them 5 days to reply to one message I sent despite being online and posting all over.  A is no longer invited out to events there was arrangements for trick or treating and A never got an invite which caused her to be upset.   I'm not too fussed about my friendship with these people if anything I'm just disappointed especially since I leant C money, helped with childcare issues and pretty much treated B like my 3rd child but I'm old enough to understand that some times people just like to take advantage.   A and B are back on friendly terms have sorted it out because well they're kids it's what they do and I've witnessed B having a tantrum over the fact they weren't allowed to come out and play with A which tells me it is 100% on the mum.  I'm not sure what to do here. I'm happy to walk away from this and cut my loses but A loves B and wants to play with them and doesn't understand why they can't play with them anymore. They're in the same class at school and like I said we're neighbours aswell so it's hard to even separate the 2.  I've tried addressing the issue but just get silent treatment. I don't want my child being upset and this is beginning to affect them and I have no clue how to address this.  Edit: A is under review for autism so some times struggles to understand certain things. I have explained that C doesn't want to talk to me anymore which is why we aren't doing anything together but she's struggling to understand why.",

So I was thinking of getting him an iPad for Christmas so he can get the hang of it better, but it feels too… soon? I don’t want him stuck on an iPad everywhere we go, so should I only let him use it at home? Am I just being weird, and should just suck it up and let him take it with him places?

My job requires me to pretty much be on the computer the whole day but is usually stress free and repetitive. His job is going to be absolute hell until after the holidays (overall stress, going in earlier, coming home later, running around like a chicken with their head cut off, etc).   We both get up around 630, husband gets ready and leaves. I make sure our teen boy is awake, getting in the shower, not wearing sandals in 20 degree weather, ya know the usual. He leaves around 720 and I start work at 9. Some mornings I work out and shower before work, but honestly have slacked this last month or so. Some mornings I start on daily chores and some mornings I nap for an hour and half lol. More recently it is the napping because I am exhausted.   Every day I try to keep up with everything I can but just can't and am feeling discouraged. Laundry every single day (our clothes, teen clothes, blankets, pillows, couch pillows, towels, something is ALWAYS dirty lol), a load of dishes, picking things up, wiping things down (not even DEEP clean just wiping and throwing trash away), etc. I do these things on my two 15 minute breaks and my lunch at work since I am at home I can eat whenever I am hungry. While I am working I also have a daily planner to keep from forgetting anything. Even chores if I don't write it down I forget and then it is double the amount tomorrow. I meal plan for the week, make the grocery list and order groceries to be curb side picked up or just delivered to my house since I am always home anyways. I do all of our finances and pay our bills for the whole month at the end of the previous month, so I am fortunate I don't have to really BUDGET bills every pay check like we used to have to do.   My husband comes home usually around 530 when I get off work and he cooks dinner, although if he stays later I start when I get off work. I cook probably once a week, we get pizza or take out twice a week and he cooks the other 4 days. We eat dinner, watch TV, and are ready for bed at 9. On my husbands days off he will usually have one day of tasks/cleaning, one day relaxing. I do the same on my days off on the weekend. He does things like, rip up carpet and replace with hardwood flooring, fixing the toilet when it breaks, anything like handyman tasks which I cannot do for the life of me lol.

It bothers me but he literally doesn't see it until I ask it to be done and oh wow! I didn't realize the handrail was that color!!! 😂🤦  I just feel like I am getting burnt out. We both have to work income wise otherwise I would be a SAHM. How do you get everything done everyday without feeling like you are drained by noon?? Yes, I do know that I do \"more\" household chores than my husband, but he works physically and mentally so much harder than I do. His job also pays more than double my income. He will do anything I ask of him, but he is already as exhausted as I am when he walks in the door.   Just.... How do you do it??? I would love to be the susy homemaker home that has hand decorated cookies and personalized crafts for every holiday making the home sparkle and shine with happiness 😂😂😂 I feel like I am lucky to walk around my house and not see cat throw up I have to clean up 🤦and not be telling my son for the SIXTH time that morning TO BRUSH HIS TEETH.  Do I need adderall in my life? More than 1 cup of coffee?? 😂 How do I do this for the rest of my life??  Seriously, any suggestions on how to make my life more efficient, less tiring, less stressful??? I am generally HAPPY with my life, we own a home, my husband is my best friend, my son is usually great (teenager lol), we are comfortable money wise and are even going back to Disney next summer. But like... This sucks. 😂😂",

    "self_text": "Hello all!  I am looking for some recommendations on a car seat that fits a coupe well.  The car is a 2012 Audi S5.  It has a decent size back seat (no middle seat however), just only two doors to get there.  Our son is 20 months old, so I don't have plans to forward face him for a while yet.  I'm particularly interested in one of the spinning car seats (Cybex Sirona for example), seems like it would make it much easier.  If anyone has used one, do they take up significantly more space than a normal car seat?    My fear is that it wouldn't have the room to spin, making it a pointless purchase.  Most traditional car seats would fit in the back of the car I'm sure.   This isn't our primary car for family things, but I do occasionally need to use this car to drive my son around.  Rarely is it more than himself and I in my car.",

Changing my wording to describe what I really meant, which is how to put in healthy limits and handle this behavior in an age-appropriate and loving way.]   Our 9.5 month baby is quite a handful, and recently has started demonstrating behaviros that can be challenging. A few examples:   He loves bathtime and was furious that I took him out of his bath yesterday. (He was in the bath for quite a while and it was time to come out). He screamed and squirmed so badly that I could barely dry him & put on his diaper and clothing.  He has meltdowns if he doesn't get an object that he wants  Wanting to be picked up constantly instead of playing (when he was already held plenty by you earlier, and when he's not hungry/tired/in-need of something/etc), and whining or fussing at your toes until you give in. If you dont give, it gradually escalates to full-fledged crying.  [EDIT -- I'm not saying I'm not willing to hold him. I'm referring to times where he wants to be held for hours on end, just because it's more interesting to be in my arms than it is to play on the floor. Putting occasional limits for that is quite a bit different than a parent who refuses to hold their child at all...]   Intentionally throwing food overboard from his highchair, and then turning and grinning at you to see your reaction.... And then repeat....   These are all normal kid behaviors, but I'm just at a loss for how to handle it at such a young age. I've read multiple parenting books but their methods all start from 1.5-2 years old earliest. Before 1 or 1.5 years, it seems babies don't have the developed intellect to understand limits. So where does that leave us?  Is there a way to put in healthy limits for such behaviors, but all while still dealing appropriately with their super young age?",

I watched hours and hours of videos, read books, tiktoks, follow IG accounts, etc. but when he was about to turn 6 months I became TERRIFIED.   The thought of it just gave me so much anxiety it made me almost cry and had panic attacks- I know- dramatic. So I started giving purées. Baby is enjoying them alot. I felt terrible at first because I felt like BLW was THE thing to do. I feel like the debate between exclusively breastfeeding vs formula feeding isn’t as intense has the purée vs BLW one.   I feel like I’m failing my baby by not doing BLW, since BLW helps have healthy relationship with food, develops fine motor skills and blablabla buuuuut the choking is too much of a stress factor for me.   It’s been a week we’re doing purée and the last two days my guilt has been slowly going away as we’re both having fun with it.   Surprisingly, I love feeding him and talking to him, I feel like it’s another way of bonding with my son, we spend time together and he’s obviously not complaining.

She’s only successfully slept in her room without waking up screaming in the middle of the night twice in the past 3 months. Every other time she wakes up she screams bloody murder. I run down there and she’ll be wide awake and just continue screaming until I convince her that she’s okay. It’s not a night terror because she’s fully conscious and conversing with me once I get her calmed down.   She did it again this morning when I woke up to get some dishes done at about 7am. She started crying from my bed (where she ended up last night after her first episode). I walked in and asked her what was wrong and she said “I thought you left me”. That’s when it hit me that maybe she was taking my husbands new job a lot harder than we thought she was.   So I guess my question is how do I help her? Sleep-wise? Emotionally? I just hate seeing her so afraid of being left alone.  Edit: she does sleep with me most nights! We’ve cosleep since she was a baby.

Examples include: Having a tough time with the seams in both socks and underwear, having to remove and put on socks over and over until they feel right, needing to put her shoes on in a specific way while pulling the tongue of the shoe up a number of times (while counting), needing her blanket to be placed on her at night in a very specific manner (pulled down to a certain level, then pulling each corner of the blanket so it's very taught over her), etc.  It really seems to be some sort of a psychological thing with her, but I can't discern enough of a pattern to figure out what might be causing it or how to help her fix it. It frustrates my wife and I obviously, but it also frustrates my daughter, so it definitely doesn't seem like something being done intentionally.  Does anyone have any advice on what we can do? What type of a doctor we should be talking to?  I will note that we've taken her to a ~~therapist~~ social worker a number of times (about 7-8 sessions I think), but no progress was made. We're at our wits end and just want to find her some help, mainly with the hearing issue.  edit: We're making an appt for an ENT asap and premptively for an actual therapist as well. My wife and I would be shocked if this were an actual ENT issue (but happy if that were the case) so we don't want to have to wait longer. I also wasn't aware that the person our daughter was seeing before was a social worker and not a therapist. We've agreed that an actual therapist would be best moving forward.",

And for the past month I am his favorite. He refuses to sleep on his own for naps or bedtime. At first it was waking up every couple of hours, and all I had to do was rock him for 5 minutes then back down. That’s doable but the past week it’s regular bedtime at 8:30pm then he’s up at 11pm and then it’s a crying fit until 4am. The last few days we said screw it and hung out in the living room and him and I would just pass out on the couch until 8am. I’ve tried bringing him into our bed but he screams and kicks dad out but when dad leaves he’s screaming “daddy!!” But hanging out in the living room and sleeping in the couch together is fine(?)   I suspect his canines are coming in. But im thinking about going to his pediatrician since it’s been about month and the last week and half has gotten worse. I know separation anxiety is normal for toddlers and infants but I want to make sure nothing serious is wrong with him.   With all that being said, I. Am. SO. Effing. Tired. I understand he loves me and I do soak up the moments of cuddles and kisses when he feels safe with me. Trust me, I love and appreciate these moments as I know they’ll be over before I know it. But, I am still tired. I don’t work well without enough sleep. I am a licensed massage therapist going to school learning more modalities such as reflexology and sacred sound healing. I am not as busy as a lot of moms but my work requires so much physical energy that I just don’t have right now. Any advice or words of encouragement?",

    "self_text": "This is both a suggestion and a warning.  14 years ago, before my first daughter was born, my wife played My Only Wish (This Year) and our baby started kicking. She noticed that she kicked every time we played it. After she was born, when she would cry and cry and had a clean diaper/didn’t want to eat, we would play the song and she would be calm during it and often would fall asleep. She didn’t respond to any other music. Of course, like all new (and young) parents, we were desperate to find anything to make her happy, so we played the dreaded song to death. Christmas music in April 😩  We had another baby this year, and she started out liking Elvis, but only kind of. One day she was really upset and nothing seemed to be soothing her. I jokingly played the Christmas-song-that-shall-not-be-named. And she calmed down and fell asleep. Of course, we’re both thinking God no not that song again. But at the same time happy that we got something in our back pocket we can always pull out. Still works better than any other song 3 months in.   Does it have the perfect formulaic rhythm that soothes babies? Or maybe my children are genetically predisposed to like Britney Spears Christmas music?   Just wanted to suggest it, maybe it’ll work with your babies. And I’m sorry if it doesn’t. And I’m especially sorry if it does.",

Well, I was like cool and we kept it in the garage. Today I again go to work and my husband is alone with the boys, when I get home, husband says my oldest saw that the open box was a computer desk, and told my husband as much. He told my son that it was a gift for me and not to tell me about it. I do have a desk I want replaced so the lie could work, but there are two identical boxes and the boxes for their desk chairs came today and he saw them and while they don't say chair they do have the words RED and GREEN printed on their sides -- my sons favorite colors and the colors of the chairs.

My current job is great. Pay is decent and I am the GM so my schedule is pretty flexable sometimes.   I try to spend as much time as possible with them but feel as though it is not enough. I want to pick up a second job to help with financial stability but I can't due to never being home to spend time with them. Babysitters are out of the question as it would get pretty pricey. I have no family in the state I live in so there is no family help. Don't have many friends and the ones i do have wouldn't want to watch them that many nights a week.  How do so many of you single parents have the energy to work 2+ jobs and still make family time? Much less keeping the house picked up?

Nothing works. Nothing helps. She still gained weight at her last checkup so the doctor isn’t concerned.  Every surface is constantly covered in spit up. We change multiple times per day. She’s changed outfits an average of 6 times per day. We have to do a towel wash every day just to keep up.  I feel so distant from her compared to our son because it disgusts me.

    "self_text": "Hello. I (38F) have 2 kids (boy 7 and girl 12) with my ex (39M). We are a family coming from 2 different countries and we leave in a 3rd country now. At home we always spoke 3 languages. With kids it was always strict- I use Russian, Farther of kids uses Finnish. We both speak and understand each others language but we chose to speak English at home between the 2 of us. Kids are fluent in both our native languages when it comes to speaking. But reading and writing is a small issue and for that we attended special weekend schools.   3 years ago we have moved to Spain. And I have enrolled kids into a Saturday Russian school. They did not attend Finnish school because at that time their Finnish was very good as they both were in Finnish educational system before we moved out. This year their dad decided to enroll them into a Finnish school too. Now here is an issue. Both schools take place on Saturdays at the same time. Russian school is every week and Finnish school is every second week.   We both want to support their education and I want them to speak Their father’s language too so I have agreed that they can attend Finnish school every second week. Thus they  will attend Russian school classes only 50% of the paid and contracted time. Keep in mind that in Russian school They do go by the official program and there is a need to do homework and kids shall Have good grades to pass to the next level. In the Finnish school they only play for several hours. No reading really. No writing. More like fun time. Which is a good thing too.   As I am The only parent who speaks Russian and we do not have any relatives here to help - I do all Their homework with them for the Russian school as well as catching up with missed material. It is challenging (balancing work, their Spanish/Catalan classes and hobbies).   Some days ago kids went to a different country to celebrate their dad’s parent birthday. And they had to skip our turn of the Russian school. So basically we have missed 3 days out of 4 in a month and it really affects their level of knowledge. I offered their dad that maybe we could skip one day of the Finnish class so that they could catch up In the Russian school and that was not welcomed at all.   His rationale behind was that they have as default less Finnish languages classes / hours than Russian classes / hours, thus they shall not skip Finnish school. However my point of view is that we have to measure not compare hours between each school but measure against how many classes are skipped vs the program that they shall cover. By agreeing on a Finnish school I have accepted that we will skip 50% of the Russian school time. And I don’t feel it’s fair that I have to skip even more now (We have 100% attendance to the Finnish school and less than 50% of the Russian with that way).   What would you do? How to Find the right balance?  We are limited in school options so these are our only chances. Plus online individual Classes of course but we really want kids to have friends also who can speak their language. Please give me your advice/point of view? Shall we skip Russian class? Shall we skip Finnish one? This will come again as a point of discussion in the future and I want to have some advice in advance. Thank you!",

They have one kid(2m) with one on the way. I have had my doubts about their parenting skills from the start but never told them how to raise their kid and never made it known. Basically just that they never seemed to discipline him until like 3 months ago and coddled him pretty heavily. Even now their discipline seems rather lazy IMO. I have almost never seen them do anything besides a verbal warning when he hits, steals toys, screams at my kids, etc. Their 2yo screams bloody murder CONSTANTLY. Almost every single morning and almost every single night for up to 2 hours for apparently no reason. I’ve seen him start screaming at the top of his lungs when my 3yo literally just says hi to him. I don’t want to assume it’s the parents without another opinion but since I’ve never seen another 2yo behave so poorly I’m wondering if it’s just normal for some kids or maybe it’s bc he has never really been told no. Now granted I’ve never lived with other young kids besides these 3 but I worked with under 5 kids at my church for years and never witnessed anything like it. Either way I’m not going to say anything to the parents this is just for my own curiosity. So Reddit, is this normal?",

    "self_text": "Hi, I am mother to 1 year old boy. About 5 months ago, he started having terrible temper tantrums while nappy changing. He has changing table next to his bed and like he has 6th sense, he knows change is coming the moment we go closer to the table. He trashes, screams, cries bloody murder. I tried singing, distracting, calming him down, not to interact at all and yeah even raising my voice. Nothing made any difference. One nurse asked if he might have bad past on the changing table but no. Yeah he hit his head few times when he pushed himself from me and bumped his head but that's it. Never felt, never got hurt, nothing. Also he has no issues to make him anxious about nappy change. He almost never had any rash and his biological movements are absolutely normal. I am really struggling to find out what his deal is. Also it's not like I am taking him for nappy change in the middle of playing or eating. The second we are done... Snap... Everything is all joyful and dandy.  Any advice appreciated",

When we returned home there was a smell of smoke in the house, we questioned her and she admitted she went outside onto the balcony for a cigarette. She was never a smoker but seems to have picked up the habit recently. She said her mom doesn’t know and she only does it every now and again.   I was super angry because it is super dangerous for baby and I’m starting to worry about the health and increased SIDS risk. We asked her if she washed her hands after before touching the baby and she paused and the said she did, but I don’t believe she did.   We sent her home. We opened the balcony door for a bit to air out the room. Our neighbour called us from her side and mentioned that she was out on her balcony and could see someone smoking in the house. The door was open but she was smoking in the same room as our baby.   I’ll be having a chat with her parents but I’m more concerned atm on how risky is this for our baby?   We changed her clothes, bathed her, moved her to a different room and kept her out of the living room. Is there anything else we should do?   I know leaving our baby so young seems irresponsible but it was a necessary appointment.  No one has ever had this issue with our niece. She wasn’t a smoker previously. She definitely won’t be babysitting ever again!",

The issue began when she informed me our son was vegan, almost a year ago. She’d been vegan for a few years at this point, but we’d agreed we would let him do whatever he wants. Tell me if Im wrong but surely a 3 year old(at the time) can’t make the decision to be vegan- when he still doesn’t even know the meaning of the word.   Me and the ex ended up having a massive argument about this when she told me, because I don’t believe he could make that decision for himself. Just because you ask the kid if he wants to be vegan & he says yes does not mean he knows what it means- he still can’t tell me the meaning of the word.   I have him 3 days a week & don’t feed him a vegan diet. He eats whatever I’m eating, and is fine with it. I’ve even asked him if he’s cool eating meat & having cow milk with his cereal etc and he says yes. The kid doesn’t care about what he eats, but ex gf has now found out, and gone mental, saying I’m disrespecting his right & has also told our son that it’s not okay what he’s eating  & made him fearful of food.   I want my 4 year old to have a good relationship with food, and he was fine before she started interfering with his diet. However if I just go along with this, it results in less conflict & maybe he will be more comfortable.",

    "self_text": "I’ve got 3 kids - F9, M6 and F2. We are moving into a new house with 3 bedrooms. Our oldest daughter and son have been sharing a room for about 3 years; the youngest has her own room and recently started sleeping in a single bed.   The eldest two have a decent, fairly normal sibling relationship, but there is a large dose of fighting, and generally completely different personalities.   Oldest daughter is tidy, organised and very mature. Son is an immature 6. He’s silly, messy and can really rub his older sister the wrong way. Youngest is fun-loving, easy going and the total boss of the kids.   The oldest two are close in age (2.5years) and have plenty of interests in common. They fight, but they also hang out a bunch.   My oldest is petitioning for her own room. Son doesn’t really care as long as he has someone to share with, but if asked to choose would say big sis. Youngest would be fine either way.   I’m hesitant to group the younger two together just because they are at such different stages and my son can also get his little sister quite riled up at bedtime. He also teases her a bit and is generally a little unpredictable.   Whereas oldest daughter is soon to be coming into tweendom, she can be quite moody and having to compromise with her brother isn’t the worst thing in the world.   We eventually plan to renovate to add another bedroom (and I’ve promised my eldest her own future bathroom) so this would likely just be for the next 2 years.   So, should I keep sharing arrangements the same as they are, or put the other two kids in together and give my eldest daughter her own room in the new house?",

We are very excited about this trip and are intent on traveling. However, I can't imagine taking a 4-5 week old baby for that kind of drive. When my older kid was that age she wouldn't handle a car seat, nursed constantly, and was a screaming mess. My husband and I could handle the 8 hour drive, but I can't imagine subjecting my toddler to that. I was considering taking a train with the baby, but I'm concerned about exposure because he'll be so little. Has anyone done this? Should I ask my husband to drop our toddler off, drive back home, and take us back up? Should I risk the train? I know it'll be such a big help when we get there but I'm dreading the drive.

He will start school this summer. Bad things tend to happen in schools. It's not like kindergarten. I want to prepare him. I just don't know how to.   I was looking some books for him and I really want him to know stories like Peter Pan, Lion King, the Jungle Book etc ...  Because all he tends to read are science books and biographies but come on, he is not even 6 :(   I am just not sure if I should force him to read these stories, or to watch. I don't know what is the right path here. Forcing doesn't feel right.   I guess what I am asking is, how can I help him to grow emotionally.

He’s also been waking up anywhere between 5:40 and 6:30 am instead of the 7-7:30 wake up he used to do. Does he suddenly have lower sleep needs? Could a sleep regression really last 3 weeks straight?

I’m a first time mom, raised by my dad who is as helpful as he can be but unfortunately some things he just doesn’t know as he didn’t get full custody of me till I was two. And my MIL is the worst person to talk to (she’s the type to ask my fiancé, her son, why our 14 month old is still eating baby food and not real food, even though we’ve told her over and over her just wasn’t into baby lead weening and only eats “real food” when we’re out to eat, if you have thought on how to help this also people feel free to share)  anyways, I’m wondering if I should wait to build the bed and start him out with just a mattress on the floor, his entire room is baby proofed and ready to go but now I’m wondering what if he rolls off the side of the bed, we plan to have the wood go up a little higher than the bed but I’m wondering what if he decides to just go over it to get out of bed, maybe starting off with a mattress on the floor is best? He will be 16 months old by the time he gets the bed. Thought?   My other wonder is, when do you give a child a blanket? How do you know when it’s safe? Are there tips and tricks? Is there a certain kind of blanket better to start off with?   On a completely different topic, my son is 14 months old and not understanding clapping or waving and seems like he’s slowly getting behind and I’m not sure how to help him with these developmental milestones, I’ve tried showing him and doing it with him and he just laughs but doesn’t do it back.

During my pregnancy, I was lenient about my husband playing games because I had a preconceived notion that once the baby was here, he wouldn’t have that much time.  My husband works from home. Majority of the time he’s playing games on his phone, if not he’s watching video game related videos (and sometimes both). After work, he still plays games and after dinner (8pm) he’ll help with bathtime and then he goes to play video games until midnight. In a typical day, he’ll only spend time with our baby if I need to eat or run an errand and can’t take the baby with me (usually an hour or so errand because I breastfeed). So if I’m not running an errand, he’ll have our baby for 30min or an hour at most. I love him and absolutely adore him as my partner. As a father, I wish he would do more. He told me that he hates this stage because he can’t do much with our son, that he’s waiting until he walks. This is a similar conversation we had when I was pregnant. That he was going to wait until the baby got here to speak to him and interact with him. He doesn’t even know how to put our son to sleep or calm him down. How do I bring this up to him without hurting his feelings? He’s a great husband to me. He makes time for me and allows me to have time for myself anytime I need it. He’s allowed me to stay home for our baby without making me feel guilty or stressed about it. I just want him to spend more time with our son without playing games and actually bond with him.",

    "self_text": "TL;DR: best lice treatment for a squirmy, sensitive preschooler who's bad with communication and his stubborn lil sis who hates having her hair combed bc idt the Nix Cream Rinse worked  Idk if it was left on ALL parts of the hair for 10 minutes because the application took long because of the amount of hair he has and I started freaking out that it was really starting to hurt him (or if it was just a mild irritation due to his reactions, didn't  look  irritated but it doesn't always have to look irritated to hurt).  So anyway, I was pretty close to 10 minutes on all parts of the hair, I combed out at least 1 live bug although that was the only one I saw because he has light hair, lots of it and I didn't know what to look for irl.  Is this normal? Do they die after? Not looking forward to doing a comb through today.  When ppl pick the lice out (live one's, not nits) do u crush them first or put them in a solution to kill them or what?  It's supposed to keep working for 12 days or something but I'm not convinced.  Anything I can add to this other than manually pulling out bugs and nuts that would be a good option? I didn't like using it in general because I couldn't really tell if my son was okay and it didn't seem to  visibly  coat the strands unless the rest of the hair was pulled together where it would stick together (but roots don't stick together since the roots are spaced out, obviously)  The rest of the family, we used olive oil all over our scalp and I'm not washing it out for another day, we heat treated bed linens, pillows, stuffies their hair comes in contact with.  My toddler, who is intolerant of having her hair brushed or combed, is currently basting in oily hair. How long/often do I have to do this for to kill all bugs and subsequent eggs?  Thanks!",

It always misses the spit up rag, or my two year old has ran off with the rag and I don’t have one.   Has anyone dealt with this? My pediatrician basically says “some kids spit up a lot!” And that’s it. and maybe that IS it and there’s nothing I can do, but I just hate being covered in baby vomit. It’s really getting to me.   Any suggestions or advice is welcome.  Edit (update): thanks everyone for your reassurance that yes, other mothers have gone through or are going through this right now. I appreciate your moral support. Plus, I appreciate all the suggestions- will be buying some cheap towels over the weekend and hoping for the best! ❤️❤️",

He gagged the first few bites then we were off to the races. I’m so proud of him, and me for not giving up because everything I’ve read says you have to keep trying to get them used to it and gagging is a vital skill they need to learn.

That has her pressing up against the bars to pass out on our hands and only lasts an hour or so before she wakes and cries some more.  One of us sleeps on the couch with her on our chest while the other sleeps in bed. This has been going on since 6 months. Before that, we could set her down after she fell asleep and she'd sleep until 2 am when she wakes up and wants to be held again. Which happens every night. My husband doesn't want to try co sleeping in our bed because of the risk of SIDS to her. I'll admit. That males me nervous too. I don't know what to do at this point. This is our one and only child and I don't want to hamper her growth or skills like self soothing. But on the other hand, I can't take her crying so much when we put her in the crib. It kills me.  I just don't know the best way to get her to sleep on her own without creating damage. My big worry about cry it out is that she'll feel alone and unloved.

My son is 14 and is already reluctant if he is even supposed to put on a nicer shirt, which rarely happens, the last time was a year ago. And now he needs a tuxedo.  We've had discussions about it, but he's adamant that he certainly doesn't want to wear a tuxedo or any other suit. Yesterday I reminded him again that we have an appointment at the tuxedo rental this morning and he can either cooperate and perhaps have a say in the matter, or he continues to behave like a small child, but doesn't need to be surprised if he gets treated like one and dad chooses his clothes for him. He continued to maintain his stance that he certainly won't dress like that.  I still have a trump card up my sleeve, namely a concert he wants to go to soon. I could use that as a leverage and I'm pretty sure it could work, but it's more of a last resort for me forcing him to do it.  I'm just getting tired of this discussion and don't know what else I can do. In any case, he will go to the wedding in accordance with the dress code, there is no discussion about that. Forcing him to do it feels a bit wrong, but I don't know what else to do.",

It went mostly OK except that I didn't have time for anything outside of being a parent and catching up on household chores. I have no family in the area and no friends close enough that I can ask someone to take care of him for an extended period of time.   We did that for almost a year before she had to move back in. Son's mom is getting ready to move back out (for the last time because I cannot be her safety net anymore). I'm thinking I want to actually do 50/50, where we alternate weeks. It sounds difficult to go a full week without seeing him, but I need time to build a life outside of work and parenting and I'd like to meet someone and have a relationship, not to mention strengthening the friendships I do have.   Anyway, what I'm looking for is perspective on custody arrangements. It was nice not going too long without seeing him, but it was stressful. I never had enough downtime to relax and I always felt like I was in a rush just to get everything done. On the other hand, a week is a really long time, especially for a 6 year old.

I was pleasantly surprised that since a recent job change for the both of us more or less forced them to help more with getting the children ready since we all get up at the same time. Our schedules vary so their days off and mine and children's often fall on different days, giving my spouse multiple days in which they do not interact with our children a month.  Cut to recently, due to conflicts in scheduling (afterwork doctors/dentist/and other appointments) the home has fell into disarray. A sea of dirty dishes, piles of dirty and clean laundry, toys spread far and wide. The kids are fed, clean, safe, and well rested, my self less so (teething infant so frequent night interruptions), with no time off I have no choice, but to push through.  Well tonight our youngest wouldn't sleep, I tried to console them in bed after my spouse retrieved then from the kids room, but we are no longer breast feeding and even offered it as an alternative solution to silence them, I heard them crying, but i eas under the assumption we were trying the cry it out then comfort. Unfortunately he is teething and would only bite and pull at the nothingness my breasts have turned into. So basically Nothing would work. I finally asked my spouse to take them out to the living room as I only had 2 more hours in which I could sleep since they had the previous day and current day off with no children since they had went to daycare or his grandmother bless her soul.  Well this leads to an argument on how I had been asleep since 8pm and got 6 hours of sleep and shouldn't be tired.   My argument is he can easily sleep after the children and I have left for the day, but now I've been up and lost 3 hrs if sleep, am exhausted, extremely depressed at the fact that he values me so little, and probably won't go to work? Am I overreacting because of hormonal imbalance?  Mothering seems like bullshit and I'd like to become a dad.   I work full time 8 hr days, he works rotating shifts giving him more days off collectively than I get. Not only that, but on my days off daycares/babysitters aren't an option they are closed or hard to find on weekends. I'm also incharge of dentist, doctors, grocery shopping, and a majority of our chores if not done by me within time frames I set for myself, our house falls apart with chores not getting done for over a week (I've gone on quiet chore strikes to see how long before they're done).  I love my kids, I love my spouse, I love work, I just don't love them all together and I'm not sure if I'm justified in my attitude.",

I just have all the nightmare scenarios stuck in my head of constantly fighting them to do anything, they already fight getting dressed, eating, sleeping, they can’t deal when I leave the room to pee, etc etc etc. I’m dreading how much worse it’s going to get.

He runs out of the house no matter how much we tell him not to. we have no idea where he's going. he goes and hides near his friend's apartment in the complex.  We try to drag him home, but that is also physical because we literally have to drag him.   Okay what are we supposed to do next?   If I use any physical force at all, I'm in the wrong. I know reddit is very woke and liberal, they are probably going to say no physical force ever under any circumstances. It makes the kid feel unsafe about his physical wellbeing... so? Everyone else's physical wellbeing is already compromised or gone entirely.  It' not hitting him to make him hurt, or because I'm angry. I'm actually not all that angry I just don't know what else to do to calm him down.  If I hit him, it'd be a calculated tactic, not an angry outlash.  His mother decided to call the police, I was totally against it.  Like a call the cops on a 4'8\" 90lb 9 year old? Huh? She did. They came and talked to him, they calmed him down. Now he's sleep.   He's 9. he's very quick to play victim. he's like \"oh i'm scared cus the cops are here.\"  huh?   Everything these days is about protecting a child's feelings. What about everyone else's?

    "self_text": "In advance, I’m sorry about the lengthy post but I’ll try and keep it short.  The back end of 2021 my 3 year old daughter was constantly ill, every week it was something else coughs, colds, sickness, infections & then finally chickenpox which hit her pretty hard. At the start of the new year the same patterned continued but with an underlying sense that she was pretty run down and becoming more & more lethargic almost most of the day, every day. Then she picked up an ear infection.  This ear infection lasted for a lot longer than it should have, because of the pandemic situation at the time it was originally impossible to get a real doctors appointment, when we finally did they palmed us off twice before we returned and demanded a swab and a fitting antibiotic being given however apparently this was way too late. It turns out because of the doctors reluctancy to actually do there job this infection had turned into mastoiditis and then into a brain abscess 😫 we found this out after arriving at A&E and refusing to leave until she had had a scan, which they did basically to get rid of us & I thank my lucky stars we did, we was rushed to the Birmingham Children’s Hospital and she underwent emergency brain surgery within hours. I’ll skip a lot of the following few months however luckily a full recovery with very little damage was achieved by my little lady, and after 3 months she was back to nursery in early May!  So, because we are now entering the time of year when there are constant colds and illness going round and I guess with a little bit of PTSD (if you will), I’m really really struggling almost every night to keep my cool, I’m constantly checking her temp, making sure she’s ok, and generally stressing 24/7 about what could happen at any time. I understand our situation earlier this year is relatively rare but still I’m inherently a worrier and I don’t think I could cope with anything that serious again, nor would I want my daughter to be so close to not being here a again.   Does anyone have any advice with worrying about illnesses and I guess just some words of comfort? me & her mom are equally bad for stressing and jumping to conclusions and we don’t help each other out in that regards 😅  Again, sorry for the rant but I really feel my mental health has taken a battering the last few weeks since the weather has turned and she’s picked up a few bouts of sickness/colds, and I can’t go through life constantly on edge about something like this.

He knows bad behaviour from good behaviour; we can ask whether his behaviour was good or bad and he responds correctly, but when questioned why he did things, or when we explain why he should or should my do something he seems to pay no attention, and proceeds to repeat undesirable behaviour, or devolves into whinging and pushing us away.  He also seems to completely ignore our requests, we frequently have to ask multiple times for even simple tasks.  We try to be as calm and patient with him in all situations but it doesn’t seem to get us anywhere; even calm discussion results in him tantrumming so we’re at a point where patience is very thin and easily results in a raised voice, this still doesn’t get a response.  We’re wondering if he has some behavioural difficulties that we could seek help with, or if there’s something we’re doing that is causing his behaviour. Perhaps it’s just a phase?

I recently began ordering one chicken bowl ($8.45) and 9 taco tortillas ($1.50) for a total of $9.95.   Now the kids get 3 tacos instead of two and there's still plenty left for a decent meal for myself. Every time I say I'm going to save half for later and never do. It's actually a really good way to limit myself from eating the whole thing.",

He doesn’t go to daycare and isn’t around other toddlers ever, and my husband thinks that’s why. He thinks he’s falling behind because of it. I don’t feel this is the case because I know there’s plenty of toddlers who stay home with their parents and don’t fall behind. Not saying it wouldn’t help, I just don’t think it’s the reason.

As a quick background, I’m a lawyer and generally overworked and stressed out. I day dream about owning a business or running a restaurant or being a musician, but law is the career I chose and I feel I’ll be stuck in it for ever. Luckily the place I work is good people.  But the job itself is such a grind I feel beat down.  But in addition to that grind, I also lost my dog of 11 years back in July and I don’t think the grief really hit me until a couple of months ago and I have been inconsolable over it recently, crying more than I can remember.  There are also a ton of other issues I’ve been going through including excessive drinking and other unhealthy coping, I’m at my heaviest weight I’ve ever been. I’ve feeling undesired and somewhat resented by my fiancee (who is in all honesty perfect). My fiancée recently took a job that has been abusive to her and has her working crazy hours which puts a lot of stress on all of us and keeps her away from our (nursing) baby.   Getting to my son. My son is 5 months old and he is incredible and my fiancée is the perfect mother. She is confident, strong and knows exactly what to do and is the baby whisperer. The other night I set him down on the sofa (stupid of me) and turned around for a second to get his seat and I see him roll and slide off the sofa, fall onto his back and the back of his head bumped the floor (which thankfully had thick carpeting)  He cried for a minute but was generally unhurt. Literally no bump or bruise, no swelling, no vomiting or loss of consciousness or anything. We called the on call doctor that night who said to monitor him. We also brought him to the doctor in person who examined him and said his head looks perfectly healthy and there was no need for an MRI. He acts no different than before.  I on the other hand feel completely traumatized and am replaying the fall in my head over and over. Everytime it causes me panic and grief and shame. But the worst part is my ocd which is not allowing me to believe my son is fine, I think he will have some delay down the road or some other deficiency because of this despite no evidence. I am obsessing to the point of violent panic attacks and uncontrollable sobbing and feelings of worthlessness and that I don’t deserve to be a parent.  With this on top of everything I have already been dealing with I have felt multiple instances of suicidal ideation, even thinking my fiancée and son would be better off without me. I feel totally broken no matter how many people tell me my son is okay and everything will pass.  I’m restarting therapy but I needed to pour my heart out to this sub. Not sure what I’m hoping to get from it. Maybe just some kind words of encouragement.",

    "self_text": "My kid (f, 8) plays with some other girls in the neighborhood (another only child, F 9, and three sisters: 10, 7 and 5). Usually one or more of the girls will knock on our door, ask if she can play, and all is well. We've known the other only child (the 9 year old) since pre-school. We'll call her O.C. The 3 sisters moved to the neighborhood during COVID. All these kids go to different schools and only hang out in the neighborhood.  The youngest sister (I'll call her YS) hates bugs. Has a phobia, screams and cries. My kid loves bugs. Picks all of them up. Teaches other kids not to squish them. This is apparently the source of the conflict.  I was out running errands yesterday when I got a text form the husband: \"The girls rang the doorbell, and when Kid went outside, they told her they don't want to be her friend anymore.\" It sounded vicious. Apparently O.C. tried to say she wanted to be friends, but they were just going to take a break. Obviously my kid cried and ran inside.  I arranged for a playdate with another kid in the neighborhood. They played outside, found bugs together, had a good time. Got my kid fast food and snuggled and told her it wasn't her fault. Anytime we talk about it, she doesn't seem sad, but very bitter and determined.  I also texted the dad of O.C., explained what happened, and asked if my kid was ever mean or bossy, to make sense of this. He saw it after a few hours, and the girls rang my bell (I assume the dad told them to go apologize). They actually asked if my kid could play! I said no, she doesn't feel like playing with you, you hurt her feelings (this was what she told me to say). O.C. said she didn't want to hurt her feelings. I said, you said you didn't want to be her friend. That would hurt anyone's feelings. My kid came to the door then, just shook her head looking at the girls, and shut the door.  O.C.'s dad called me later. He said my kid had been saying she didn't like Y.S., and he thinks they'll just go back to normal in a few days.   I don't really speak to the parents of the 3 sisters. I don't have their numbers or a relationship with them.   What would you do? I'm going to stay out of it, but what if they ring the doorbell again? Should I encourage my girl to forgive them, or cut them off?",

Little M has been a challenge for us compared to her older sister who was the easiest baby/toddler ever. We struggled with some developmental milestones and finally got her enrolled in speech therapy. She graduated from therapy! We finally were able to understand her and communicate and were able to potty train after numerous failures. She has proven to be an incredible big sister to her baby brother. She is just an all around superstar kid.   We also have another reason to celebrate today! One year ago, on M’s third birthday, her big sister was taken by ambulance to the children’s hospital and admitted to the PICU and diagnosed with a severe case of Kawasaki disease. We came so close to losing her that day and we had to leave M and baby brother with grandparents for several days while we stayed with big sis in the hospital. M didn’t get much of a birthday last year and it was such a scary and stressful time packed with guilt.   Today we celebrate our sweet M Girl and rejoice in the health of her awesome big sister and let out a sigh of relief as we shout “WE MADE IT!”",

I am absolutely miserable being a father.  There, I said it.  My wife and I are in our mid-30’s and have a 5yo, 3yo, and 3mo.  We get almost no help from our parents and both work full time.  We are absolutely bled dry financially by childcare.  We were so incredibly happy before having children; we had to most amazing relationship I’ve ever been in.  We planned our first, but both our second and third were surprises (I have since gotten a vasectomy).  I have been completely overwhelmed since our second, but things had gotten slightly better as my youngest passed 2, but now that we’ve started over it’s unbelievable.  The baby can never sleep because either the older two boys are always waking him up, or if nothing else, the dog will.  We get almost no sleep.  We get no individual time.  We get no couples time.  Hell, it’s hard to even get 1:1 time with one of the kids.  We spend our whole miserable, tired lives shuffling kids around.  Meanwhile, everyone in our area has a nanny driving the kids around in a Range Rover.  I’m mourning the loss of the relationship with my wife.  It feels like we’ve lost so much, and yet we have no problems like infidelity or bad arguing.  We just don’t even get 4 seconds to have an adult conversation ever.  We divide every chores very well and are both anal about cleanliness so I can promise nobody is slacking.  It’s driving me absolutely insane that we can’t keep it clean.  I’ve lost all of my hobbies.  I haven’t golfed or worked out or even read a full book in years.  Same for my wife.  We both watch our friends take trips, go out, invest, etc while we do none of those things.  We can’t invest the time into our jobs that our colleagues can so we’re always the average employees when we both went to great schools and are so ambitious.  I feel like I’ve lost everything about myself.  I don’t think I’d ever actually be suicidal, but it’s crazy how often it pops into my head.  For the first time in my life I get how people leave to get eggs and never return.  Even with all of this said, I wouldn’t right-click undo my kids if I could.  They’re great little people that see as sweet as can be.  They deserve to have a great life.  I just don’t know what to do and am so spent.  Sorry for all of this.  I just needed to get it off my chest.",

If she climbs over the back, she would fall pretty far onto the floor. I think she’s pretty motivated to do so because that grants her access to the rest of the house which she’s usually kept from by a fence.  We also have a corner of the room that’s blocked off where we have a lamp, a bunch of cords plugged in, her diaper cart, etc. She could now climb off the side of the couch, onto the side table, and fall off into the danger zone.

    "self_text": "I have a 12 year old son with autism. And a 8 year old daughter.   I made sure that there’s more than enough food for everyone. I cook at least 3 times a week so there’s plenty to eat for everyone. The kids are capable of cooking their own food, making their own sandwiches, etc. The issue is one child will eat a majority of whatever we have in the house, leaving little for anyone else. Usually it’s pizza rolls, gogurt, Oreos, pop tarts whatever. One kid will claim food and call it theirs and no one else but them can eat it. Usually it’s my 12 year old with his pizza rolls. He needs his pizza rolls like his life depends on it. I have tried to wean him off it but it caused more fits. If he can’t have it, the house will have no peace whatsoever and it’s led him to eating his sister’s gogurt and my 3 yr old daughter’s snacks for day care. Daughter did the same. The constant fights, meltdowns, arguments and tantrums led me to make equal portions of everything in the house. I’m pretty fed up with the fights.   I used to buy a 120 bag of pizza rolls but since my son will go through that bag quickly we bought 3 bags of 40 pack, and write names of each child on each bag. As well as making sure each kid has equal portions and having their names on each snack bag. If they run out, they run out for the week. Each leftover bowl had their name on it.   The expectation is that each kid only eat food with their name on it, and not foods that have someone else’s name on it. Exception is if anything else has no name, it’s free game. If their name is not on it, it’s not theirs and they need to ask permission from the person whose name is on it.   Except neither of my oldest respected the boundaries set. I have reminded them of the expectations several times. It’s led to fight over fight and getting calls at work from the kids complaining. As someone who works 8-12 hour shifts a day, it gets very tiring.   The worst incident happened last night after the kids ate dad’s leftover steak and ribs from a family cookout from the night before. The kids had their own take home meals with their own names on it. Dad’s food has his name on it. They had some of dad’s food and dad flew off the handle and started screaming at the kids. I sent the kids upstairs for a bit and husband and I started fighting. Not getting into how it went but this is when after husband calmed down, I went to the kids and explained to them again the expectations, and dad was furious because they touched something that isn’t theirs.   I’m going to have a meeting with everyone in the house including dad and the kids regarding the expectations, and I will start strengthening punishments. I’ve had enough.   I’d like advice on how we can stop this. I work too hard for the family to fight like wild animals over the plentiful supply of food.",

Sometimes, I can get her to try them, but she almost always never likes them.  I am a single mom. I work a demanding job, and at the end of the day, the last thing I want to do is make one dinner, her not eat it, and then have to make her something else. I'm passionate about nutrition. I typically feed her healthy foods when I cook at home, but I'm defaulting to ordering out more than I would like to (a few times a week) because I am so tired of eating the same meals every single week. She's tired of them too, but I'm at a loss here.   When she was younger, she had a much more diverse palette. Then, her dad and I ended our relationship. I had to move, and eventually, I got full custody of her. While she was with her dad and after we moved (to a different state), our eating habits changed. I no longer had access to my kitchen, my cooking utensils, or the ingredients I used to have when we lived in a bigger city.   I already know that if I keep exposing her to different foods over time, she will eventually start to like things. But I'm at my wits end /right now/. The thought of noodles makes me want to throw up. I'm tired of arguing with her about what to eat....and I'm tired of feeling guilty for ordering out.  I'm open to any and all advice and also recommendations for quick/easy recipes.",

    "self_text": "Grateful for advice or input from experienced parents.  Our beautiful baby boy was born at a whopping 9lbs 7oz, or 4.28kg last Wednesday via C-Section (unplanned, baby in breech).  He lost weight in range (as normal) to 3.89kgs, and has been gaining since - I am not producing quite enough breast milk for his hunger, and we supplemented with formula, although he takes less and less each day and more breastmilk as my supplies come in.  My midwife is stating he needs to be back at birth weight by Day 10 - this seems to be a punishing target.  Yesterday (Day 7) he was 4.1KG, with another 180g to go.  He is stable and gaining bit by bit, so I am not concerned and I think the midwife is being too draconian on such a target, especially when he will have expelled a lot of amniotic fluid by weeing because of the Caesarian.  Are such pushy weight gain targets normal/reasonable?  He is an easy baby and loves to sleep - when he is hungry I feed him and he gobbles down two boobs, expressed milk (which I pump when he sleeps), and sometimes his \"dessert\" (formula) on top.  This can be as much as 100ml in one serving, which is huge for a newborn (but he is a big full term boy!).",

    "self_text": "Hi everyone,   I am a first time father and first time user of this sub. My wife and I have an 8 month old, who just went through the 8 month sleep regression and it was terrible. We think he is returning to his older sleep cycle now but decided to do sleep training to help him sleep properly.   So, before the regression our little guy would sleep through the night, waking up 1-2 times to feed. During the regression he was waking up every 1-2 hours each night and would only want to be nursed back to sleep.  We are doing the so-called “slow and steady” method of sleep training, wherein we remove parental interventions like singing, rocking, holding, and nursing, one by one until the baby is able to fall asleep on their own when left in the crib.   So far it has been working well, but the nursing intervention is very difficult to remove. It seems our baby has become quite dependent on being nursed by mommy back to sleep. However, mommy is a human and also needs sleep haha, so I have been doing my best to console the little guy back to sleep as much as I can each night, but he is very resistant to my attempts and eventually mommy will need to step in. It’s obvious baby is not always hungry each time he wakes up, but is likely using mommy as a pacifier. We have never used actual pacifiers in the past and have tried giving one to baby a few times but he has always rejected it. Now, since I cannot nurse the baby I am left with rocking and holding to console him.   Now, here are my questions.  When I rock baby to try and get him to sleep he typically    cries (screaming) non-stop  squirms as much as he can to get away from me and get to mommy My first thought was, fine squirm around and tire yourself out so you will fall asleep.  But now I wonder if this has any negative impact on my and the child’s relationship, i.e., could my holding and preventing him from leaving my arms make him feel “trapped or anxious?”    Finally, I’ll note that before the sleep regression this was not as much of a problem. If baby woke up at night, I could pick him up and rock him and he would fall asleep. Now he has this need for Mom only in order to stop crying.  I have been told that this dependency on mom is a phase that newborns go through and eventually he will be able to be consoled again by me, but is there anything I could do to hurry this along?",

He has video to prove it too. But he’s been wanting to handle it himself because “snitches get stitches”. He told them to stop. They haven’t. He’s tried to ignore/avoid them. They still shove him around. So he’s finally asked for our help. I’ve offered to either a) have his father (much more the level-headed one in our relationship) talk to their parents or b) have the school counselor (neutral party) bring the boys in to have an airing of grievances.  I am fine if these kids never talk to each other again, and he understands kids grow apart (although it breaks his heart). He knows these two are not good friends in the long run so I don’t see the friendships being repaired. But they have been BEST friends since kindergarten so we all hate for my him to have these relationships end like this. Plus they are on the same team for basketball and baseball, and will go to same high school. It’s just easier to end things more cordially, right???  Help???

This new daycare is nicer, the same price, and much nicer playground/outdoor area and it has a gym. We live in minnesota, a gym is a really nice perk!

We've had conversations about respect and treating friends/girlfriends with respect. My bio son is 4 months younger so they are in the same grade. Both boys started telling me they had \"girlfriends \" 3 yrs ago and at first I took it lightly and told them they're too young for gfs etc. As they get older, being conscious that I cannot control them at school, I have encouraged them to be open with me and we've talked about consent, mutual respect, and boundaries. Neither has ever been on a date or over to a girl's house, their \"relationships\" consist of contact at school, txting and phone calls. Foe context, both boys live with me and my fiancé full time. I am their mother. My SS's mother has built a better relationship with him but used to be nonexistent. Ss loves me but feels i have too many rules bc i require grades to be passing, them to be respectful, chores done before video games. I went thru the phones tonight bc I noticed Ss's txting activity spiked. He is txting at least 2 girls, telling them both he loves them and calling them baby. I'm more upset bc one is related to a relative so we see her occasionally at holidays. I'm livid. I'm not going to react right now bc I will be irrational but want to act in a way that is effective and gets the point across that this is unacceptable. This is hurtful and I expect more. I have had conversations with him so that clearly didn't work. Help?  Edit: Thank you! I'll be talking to him later today.   I'm not concerned with him getting upset about me going thru his phone. He is aware any of his parents can go thru it and does not take issue with it. The 4 of us in our immediate family are very free with our phones around each other so although some ppl may take issue with us monitoring him, we haven't had an issue about it to date. He is very comfortable talking to us about things he feel should change. We've modified other things before based on his wants as he gets older.  So far the 4 parents he has agree with this and so does he.  Lastly I get some ppl take issue bc I misspoke and referred to the girls as little girls. My apologies, I misspoke once. I think of everyone involved as super young and my Ss is a year or 2 older than them so I was thinking as I typed.",

    "self_text": "My newborn is just 8 weeks old. I love her and my spoude deeply. However, I felt so sidelined and ignored by my spouse and family members. I know I should be a good father, and I did do most of the feeding, diaper changing, soothing the baby, putting my baby to sleep for the past month. I also made sure my spouse is fed and hydrated, and ensured her that I'm always there to listen to her and help her in anyway that I can. Despite all that, I can't shake the feeling I haven't done or helped enough yet.   My state of mind really went downhill when I started to go back to work when my newborn is 2 weeks old and I'm spending less time with both of them. I started to think they don't need me anymore because she's handling the situation pretty well without my help. Then, my mother-in-law, God bless her, lent a hand in taking care of her. However, she sometimes mouthed off and said hurtful things without meaning to and made me feel inadequate and stupid. Very soon, I no longer knew where I fit in the picture.   It was a good thing actually because it means they can take care of themselves, and I'll have more time to work and provide for the family(working two jobs). But then I started thinking who am I supposed to be if they don't need my help or emotional support? It's this paradoxical thinking that sent me spiraling down into overthinking and shouldering unnecessary self-blames.   Things got better recently, though. I concluded it's a combination of lack of sleep (key factor) and a temporary loss of intimacy between me and my spouse. I talked it over with her and I felt better with her assurance that all of these are just in my head.   I know my sharing isn't exactly a serious case but I needed to say this out loud and let my story be heard. Thank you deeply if you took the time to finish reading my post. Thank. You.",

    "title": "The Best Sleeping Practices for Your Baby",
    "self_text": "Ensuring that your baby gets enough sleep is crucial for their development. That may seem like a lot, but there are a number of factors that can contribute to disruptions in your baby’s sleep. Below are some of the best practices for helping your baby get the rest they need.  It’s no secret that getting a good night’s sleep is crucial for both baby and parent. But with all the advice out there, it can be hard to know where to start when it comes to developing healthy sleeping practices for your little one. Read on for 5 top tips to ensure that your baby (and you!) get the best possible sleep.   1. Establish a bedtime routine and stick to it.  A bedtime routine is crucial in helping your baby wind down and prepare for sleep. Try keeping things simple at first, with a bath followed by some quiet playtime before heading off to bed.   2. Put your baby down drowsy but awake.  It may seem counter-intuitive, but putting your baby down when they’re already asleep is actually not ideal. This is because babies need to learn how to fall asleep on their own, and if they’re used to being rocked or fed to sleep, they may have difficulty doing this later on.   3.Don’t let your baby ‘cry it out’.  There’s no need to let your baby cry themselves to sleep – this can actually do more harm than good by causing unnecessary distress. If your little one is having trouble settling down, try going in at regular intervals (every 5-10 minutes or so) to check on them and offer reassurance until they drift off peacefully.   Finally…  don’t forget about yourself! Getting enough rest can be difficult when you have a young baby, but it’s important not to ignore your own needs in favor of caring for your child around the clock.",

We were also advised to have him screened for autism, and we are working on that. There are some behaviors that I've observed (and the autism screener confirmed as well), that lead me to believe he is on the spectrum.   Does anyone have any suggestions for a new dad as to how I can raise an autistic child? Would I have to worry about socialization?",

I don’t like that I had to do it but I had to for my own sense of safety and well-being .  I’m so scared of being the type of parent that my child feels they need to cut out. I keep reading articles about how it’s more and more common. On the one hand, what my dad did to get cut out is so clear and I gave him literally years to correct it, so I hope I would be able to tell with my own child if I was doing anything worthy of being cut out. On the other hand, what if I just don’t see it or what if there is nothing I can do to stop it?  Does anyone else worry about this? So I need therapy? Or is there something else I can do here?",

Please help.  Update: I wanted to add an update in case there is someone in my situation in future. In the end I had to fully stop breastfeeding to get my son to accept a bottle. He mostly withheld for the best part of two days and I was really worried about dehydration but suddenly he realised there was no alternative and was enthusiastic to feed. We also gave him a dummy (pacifier for the Americans) to help get him to sleep and that was a game changer. We then learnt very quickly that he has a cows milk allergy which was why I had such a difficult breast feeding journey. I wish I tried earlier, it would have saved me many sleepless nights.",

My mom lived in a different province and came to stay with me after I faced some intense difficulties financial and mental, she came to help and support me which I am grateful for. Where she was living, she was helping my sister with her two kids, one of them has a few challenges and is autistic. My sister moved because of job opportunities but had to leave to come to rescue me. My sister kind of needs her back now and she is moving back and she wants to move with my daughter as I am working two jobs and in the process of going back to school. I don't want to be separated from my child. I also don't want to be constantly stressed and would obviously like a shot at excelling in my studies and getting into a proper uni so I can like lol actually make something of myself. This is a 'normal' situation for many people where I am from but it feels wrong. Is it one of those sacrifices people make for an outcome that's much better than my current situation? I am planning to have it only be for next year and then I move to where they are and hopefully get into school there, but it's wishful thinking. I want to get an education and not stay in a dead-end situation. But I don't want to be without my child.",

    "self_text": "My wife and I found out we were pregnant 4 days ago. We have been trying for several months so this was planned, both in our early 30’s.  The thing is since we have found out, rather than be excited, I am terrified for our relationship. We are both so happy, crazy about each other and show a lot of affection for each other through touch as well as words.   Everything I am reading online seems to point to the mother simply being too overwhelmed, tired, touched out, etc to have any affection for their partners, in many cases, even that their love for their husband is diminished.  This is what I fear more than anything. So I guess the question is, is there some positive news out there?   I know things will be hard, and that we will be extremely tired and there will be many arguments, but in between those moments, will my wife still have the same love for me as she does now?   I have spoken to my wife about this and she shares the same fear. We have promised each other we will do everything we can to ensure our marriage takes priority and our child will fit into our lives, as we both strongly believe that a happy marriage is key to a happy child. But is this just naive? Is our affection and love for each other simply a price we are likely to pay to have a child?  I know it sounds dramatic, and I feel so guilty for not being ecstatic about expecting our first child, but it feels like I am about to lose the woman I married.  Edit: thank you all so much for the advice, encouragement, and home truths. It really has helped immensely. It’s getting harder to keep up with all the replies but do know I will be reading and digging into every bit of advice on here. You’re all excellent people",

I’m gentle too, she’s not crying from pain.  Her dad hates when I do it, he simply says “Just don’t even brush them”. Like I HAVE to brush her teeth dude, she drinks juice and eats a sugary food at least once a day. Today I did it and she was flat out pissed. I asked her afterwards if I could give her a hug goodnight, and she said NO. I tried explaining in detail why I have to brush her teeth, and that it’s important. I compared it to changing her diaper, like you don’t like your but wiped but it has to happen.  Once when I saw my mom I had to hold her and do it while she screamed. I asked my mom like “Am I a horrible person that I have no other way to do this? It’s either this or they don’t get brushed” and she just reassured me that that’s what moms have to do. We do the stuff kids hate but it’s for the kids health/safety/etc.  is there another way I can brush her teeth without literally holding her down and forcing a toothbrush in her mouth? All the gentle parenting videos online make me feel like a horrible abusing psycho because I retrain her and force the toothbrush in her mouth.

I walk him to school everyday and he cannot stay on one side of the sidewalk. You know how if you are walking with someone you sort of naturally keep pace and have a conversation. But with this kid I am constantly tripping over him. One minute he’s on the left, the next he switches to the right and stops. He has sensory issues so holding his hand or even trying to guide him by gently holding his shoulders is a no go, he squirms out in seconds. He never needed his hand held as a toddler so I let him explore and be independent then, but now he’s driving me crazy. I try to spell out for him how to walk but I’m wondering if this just how kids this age walk or if I need to bring this up with his OT too. Or if you have any advise. Thanks!",

I’ve tried looking it up but it doesn’t give me much. I also gave him an oatmeal and aloe Vera bath today in hopes that can also help a bit. He’s only ever had a small diaper rash before after coming home from his grandparents house from a visit, and he visited them again last weekend and now I’m dealing with this again expect it’s worse this time. one time he came home after about four hours and they didn’t change his diaper AT ALL! another time he was over for about 6 hours, and I went over his grandma was holding him and she said he wouldn’t settle down and I said have you changed his diaper? And she said no, and I was just like well maybe that’s why. I just don’t get it, if you wanna visit with your grandchild you need to be willing to change his diaper. he’s never ever had diaper rash from me. it’s always when he comes home from visiting with his grandparents, I have a hard enough time trusting people, and this is making it even worse.",

None of the books I've been reading or exercises I do to control my emotions have helped me.  I've started smoking again.

He apologised for all the carry on and hey presto dd (f5) now sleeps in her own room. However she still wakes up shouting for me at least twice a night. We’ve found that putting on age friendly YouTube videos at low volume helps as she won’t settle otherwise. Her tv will go on standby eventually so she wakes me up. She needs toilet so wakes me up to open her gate. Or at stupid o’clock she wants something else to sleep to on YouTube and wakes me up. Her sleep specialist has advised me to purchase an audio device that tells stories as screen time reduces melatonin. At first she suggested a Toni box. Problem is that’s no good because not only is it ridiculously expensive but, like the tv, it goes on standby so she’ll just wake me up again when it does which kinda defies the objective.

    "title": "Husband and I have different views on Parenting My Son, his Step Child",
    "self_text": "Where do I start.   I'm from the rural south. My parents didn't graduate highschool. There was a lot of dysfunction. I was a hard core drug addict in my adolescents. My life was still pretty messy when I met my husband.   He's from southern CA. There's dysfunction in his family too, but him and all his siblings graduated highschool and went to college, and most have upper degrees. His parents didn't graduate highschool, but still went back to college later in life.   He is pretty strict with my son (9 years old currently, but known since he was 5 years old). He says his dad was strict (abusively so he will admit) and that the only way to be sure that you make it to the upper middle class is to have strict discipline.   It's hard because he is involved with my son. He plays videogames or outside adventures with him, he talks about how he feels, he's adamant that my son's self image is the most important thing.   But he scares me when it comes to discipline. He yells really loud. One time so loud my son urinated on himself because he was so scared. I get involved and he claims I'm undermine his authority and he's not going to be involved in anything anymore. \"If you want to raise a juvenile delinquent, then you're on your own\"  I don't know what to do. It's clear he wants the best for my son. He doesn't care if my son turns out gay, isn't the best student, or even if he curses. He says it's all about behavior. You behave your way to a successful life.   And he definitely throws in my face that his parents successfully raised eight children that went to college and beyond. My parents couldn't get me out of highschool. He thinks his parenting style is right.   I just want my kid to feel safe. He wants him to be emotionally tough I guess.   I don't feel like my thoughts count because I was a real mess when we met. And my son had so much anger at me.  He helped me go back and get my GED. I get to be a SAH Mom if I want or work if I want. I'm living a life I couldn't imagine before met him. He treats me kind. And for the most part he gets along with my son. And my son has improved his behavior a lot.   I just hate his discipline style.   Advice. Am I being to emotionally weak 😭  Edit:   Just to be clear. My son is provided for by my husband. He gets damn near anything he ask for. My husband grew up poor, and doesn't want the same for my son, and I don't think I'm going to do a better job at raising a functioning member of society, but damn.  Again this is what makes this very tough on me. I want my kid to grow up and have a good life and be a good person, a life I know I couldn't provide him on my own currently.  Additional edit:  People are making comments that I'm only staying because of financial security?  Being poor isn't like being rich except you don't have money.   It's not only financial security, but more importantly it's security from poor neighborhood bullshit like rampant, fucking rampant violence and crime. Getting better treatment at stores. Not having to bank with security bars and doors. Everyone is so godamn polite and welcoming. I didn't get this before. I used to pray to God, because I absolutely knew my son would go to prison, everyone goes to fcking jail. This upper middle class life has way more perks than just material comfort. Material comfort is on the bottom of that list actually.   I love my husband because he saw something in me I never saw in myself. True I need therapy to handle myself esteem issues. But damn near everyone I was raised with have horrible self esteem issues.   If you were raised in a decent enough environment thank you lucky stars but I don't think you'll ever understand what poverty is like.   So would I trade the life my son has now for the life he was definitely going to have before ...absolutely  I can agree that my husband needs therapy. I came here to see what was normal because no I don't know what was is normal, based on the feedback I now know it's excessive.   Thank you for all your replies I really do mean that. I didn't know this was going to blow up as much as it did.",

So she screamed in my office for some time and I was getting really frustrated. Later she stood up and yelled I need a hug to make me feel better! I stood there not knowing what to do, thinking would hugging reinforce the behavior? + I was a little upset at not knowing where this was coming from. She said it again and I just said let’s calm down and go to bed first. Eventually she calmed down and went to bed. I did hug her and told her I loved her after but I she had already fallen asleep.  Is this normal for a (5 yo in Jan) girl?  And would have giving her that hug she asked for been the right thing to do?

My younger son takes after my brother, and he's about 5'9 and very broad and muscular. The older one wants to kill the younger one because he's jealous of his muscles, and the younger one wants to kill the older one because he's jealous of his height. They only make it worse by teasing one another about whatever they're insecure about.

She's gotten maybe 3 days worth in because it is a literal battle trying to get them in. Worst part is, she's not scared. She just doesnt want to do it. She'll let me put one drop on and then fight me on the other.  I know she isnt scared cause she has that shit eating \"im pushing your buttons\" smile. And she giggles during the first one  Transcript of scenario   \"You cant go to school unless you let me put the drops in\"  \"But i'm scared\" instert shit eating grin and fake ass lip quivering here   \"Then you dont get to go to school\"   \"But i want to go\"   \"So take the eye drops\"   (Rinse and repeat)  After two days of this, come to find out that there is supposedly an ointment option?  If that's the case why would you prescribe the eyedrops over the ointment?   I hate pink eye.   I hate eye drops.   If i ever have to go through this again im going to rip all my hair out.

    "title": "Strained relationship with ODD child",
    "self_text": "I’m sorry for the lengthy post. Scroll down for TL;DR.  My son is 4 1/2 and has behavioral issues. To put it short he’s on a lengthy process of therapy/reeducation while also waiting out on an ADHD evaluation that he’s too young to get where we live.  One major aspect of his syndrome is oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). Basically he is extremely uncooperative in about everything, prone to break all rules, and can be hostile to any authority figure. Another thing that plays into that dynamic is the fact that my son is extremely, extremely hard headed and won’t seem to concede or internalize a rule in spite of it having been clearly stated and consistently enforced over time. Or, in other words, he’s that kid who seemingly “never learns when to stop”.  Those behavioral issues related to ODD are always present, but he has cyclical phases of better and worse. Dealing with the worse bouts is very hard for us because it always feels like a major regression. It is also very trying to be around a kid who talks back, disobeys and throws a fight about everything 24/7. So we’re very much trying to keep our cool but I’d be lying if I said we never loose patience or raise our voice.  In those phases he will resist every request from getting dressed in the morning to going to bed at night and everything in between (bathing, putting away toys, picking up mess, etc). He’s also overall more hyper and emotional than usual, and it’s much harder to get his attention. When we inevitably insist on him acting like we asked/doing what’s expected, he will yell at us at the top of his lungs and say things such as “you’re mean\" \"leave\" \"I don’t want you to talk to me\", etc, which are obviously let out in anger but hurt nonetheless.  So, getting to the point, both my husband and I have that depressing feeling that 90% of our interactions with our son are conflictual. That, at any given moment, we’re either trying to get him to comply or cooperate, getting yelled at, threatening him with sanctions, actively punishing him or debriefing a problematic behavior.   We’ve tried our best to sort of ignore certain negative behaviors as to not reward them with attention, but it’s a limited scope. At the end of the day he still needs to get dressed and to eat and to not rough his baby sister up. He’s also destructive so that’s another layer of reprimands that adds on top. He’s a pretty smart kid in that he can totally get the why and how of rules and expected behaviors but he just won’t abide. He’s also negotiating and power wrestling a lot, including sanctions.  It just… makes me so sad. I love my son and I feel my relationship with him is one of conflict and constantly telling him off or getting yelled at, and getting our feelings hurt all the time. He’s almost 5 and clearly aware that his behavior is consistently disappointing, which is wrecking his self-confidence. And I feel like an incompetent parent and unloving mom because I’m always frustrated at him. We have sweet moments of course, but even doing something fun or nice together has to be a battle at some point because of his constant defiance and boundaries pushing.  TL;DR : my son has ODD and is non-stop fighting rules and boundaries and getting himself in trouble. I feel like I do nothing but tell him off and be angry all the time and that we have a horrible relationship. I’m sad and I feel stuck in that shitty dynamic.",

I'm curious if this is normal for others' experience or if we should be looking elsewhere. My main concerns are:   The therapy session was in a large room with two other children also receiving therapies at that time. It was very distracting and overwhelming with all the noise (one of the children was nonverbal and used a running vacuum to calm/refocus), and with all the play equipment out my daughter kept flitting from one station to another which made it super hard to keep up and focus on anything the OT was asking me or trying to explain.   They pulled out a variety of noisy Vtech type toys for my daughter to play with while I was trying to complete paperwork and field questions from the OT. My daughter doesn't play with these types of toys much and gets overwhelmed with the noise/lights easily, which made it seems like an odd choice to pull out for a sensory concern visit.   The OT seemed more concerned with my daughter's W-stance and poor core strength, as well as assessing her overall motor skill capabilities than addressing her aggressive urges. The way OT was brought up to me by our pediatrician was that it could help channel her biting urges into other healthier behaviors, so I was just left wondering if this is typical for a first visit or no. There's only 2 reviews on google for this practice and it seems newer; everyone was very welcoming and kind to us but I just don't know what to expect I guess.",

I care about her very much and I think she does know this, but I don’t think we will ever have that kind of relationship. Anyway, over the past couple years her romantic interests have been with other girls, and her dad and I were always very supportive of this. We just want her to be happy. I find out today by chance that she is now interested, and possibly intimately involved with a boy. I’ve always considered her to be a responsible person, but I also know she tends to give her heart easily to people and think about consequences later.

    "self_text": "Hi. So for context I have a 10 year old son who is friends with everyone at school generally.  There has been a chat group set up by some of them in his class which I keep monitoring to make sure everything’s ok.  Last night I was reading the messages and one of the boys had put a picture up of his ‘fit’ (outfit), 2 girls then proceeded to take the piss and say things like eww and he should be embarrassed. The boy didn’t seem to really reply and then said he was going out. This upset my son as he had replied that he thought he looked good. Speaking to him today about it, he thinks it was quite mean of the girls so he had tried to talk to them about it but it has now blown totally out of all proportion by the girls getting the massive hump and they don’t understand what they have done as apparently they just can’t help it (their words) !  I was pretty shocked by the level of drama and bitching from 9 and 10 year olds !  Is this normal ? ? Should I try and help or do something or just leave it for them to sort out ? Suggestions would be most helpful !  Thanks",

My daughter (18), asked if Santa was real when she was 7 and we were honest because we don’t want to lie to the kids. But if he doesn’t bring it up, do I just let it go? It would obviously be more convenient if he did acknowledge he knows and I’m also concerned that if he really does believe, he shouldn’t and other kids would not approve of that. Should we sit him down and bring it up or just let him keep pretending indefinitely?",

My life has since completely changed and I’ve started over. Well things happen, and I am now a single mom of a 5mo baby. I am so happy to be a mom and I love baby soo much!. But I am not where I thought I would be as a mom/provider. I am single with babys father not in the picture. I have taken these last 5 months off of work and have loved being with my LO every day. I was living off of money I had saved for that exact reason. Well now I have to go back to work because I am getting low on money. Childcare costs are SO expensive (way more expensive than I expected) I am realizing that I will be barely surviving after childcare costs and my bills I already have. I feel so guilty for taking so much time off and feel even worse that I won’t be able to provide a comfortable living for myself and my baby. Holidays are coming up and I want things to be magical and great but I don’t know how I’m going to pull that off. I’m not even sure how I will afford groceries once I start work and am paying for childcare. My family is somewhat helpful but not available to watch him instead of daycare. My heart hurts and my anxiety is through the roof. I will likely need a second job which means more time away from my baby. And more childcare. It just makes me feel like crap..

    "self_text": "I’m now a mother of two. A two year old and 9 week old. The cost of living is obviously going up and you need two working parents (if they work a regular jobs) just to make it or two jobs if single parent. I’m thinking about getting state assistance for childcare so I can also work and help my significant other with bills and living expenses. I’ve never placed my first child in childcare since at the time I was working and my significant other would watch our child. But he’s now working (12-12 weekdays basically) I would have him watch the kids in the mornings before work but he’s already exhausted from work. I’m quite curious about daycares. What’s it gonna be like for my kids? My two year old hasn’t started talking so I feel like daycare would help but I’m also nervous that if anything went wrong, she wouldn’t be able to communicate it with me. How does it work with infants that breastfeed? Do I bring the milk frozen or refrigerated?  I know most daycares open at 6am and closes at 6-6:30pm. But would they allow early pick ups at like 11:30am-12pm? We only have one car and the idea I was thinking is if I follow through with daycare is to find a part time job that starts at 7am and ends at 11am so I can pick up the kids and have the car back for my significant other before his shift. If that idea doesn’t work then I was thinking to find an overnight job and scratch the daycare idea.   Originally I was really set on the overnight job but I can’t seem find anything that would work with my significant other’s job. The ideal start time was 1:30-2am and end time was 8-9am but I haven’t found a job that would start that late and end that early. So if anyone knows any overnight jobs that would work with those time frames, I’d really appreciate the suggestions.",

I’ve tried every technique I can find online, tried taking multiple breaks during the feed, tried keeping her upright after a feed (up to 2 hours and it’s time to feed again), tried changing formulas, slow feeding teeth, fast flow teeth, bicycle movements with her legs, bouncing her on my knee, walking around the house … She settles with a change of position for a few minutes then she arches her back and screams again, she eventually falls asleep but it is clearly uncomfortable for her and it’s breaking my heart.   On top of this my 14 year old dog is currently dying (Inflammation of the ovaries, inflammation of the uterus, severe intestinal infection, kidney and liver function down) she has been in the vet yesterday and today during the day on an IV of antibiotics and sent back home at nighttime, she will need a full hysterectomy and is leaking poop constantly.   I’m switching between the baby and cleaning poop of my dog every few minutes.   My hands are raw from washing and sanitising every 5 minutes. I’m exhausted and heartbroken ..   The vet hasn’t lost hope on her yet but the bills are piling up and I don’t want to do anything rash because she’s sick and it’s difficult at the moment. She is family and yeah it’s a shitty time for this to be happening but I can’t give up on her yet.   My partner is helping at the moment but he’s back in work in a few days and I don’t know how to cope when he does.   I also seem to be suffering from PPD (unsure because it could also be just situation based as I’m very attached to my dog and watching her die is killing me)  We had her in the vet for her usual checkup around 2 months ago and everything was perfect with her, it’s been a very quick deterioration.   I don’t have family that can help, I’m just lost and exhausted and don’t know where else to turn and everything smells like poop!",

    "self_text": "My 11yo son struggles a lot. He is autistic and has mild learning and speech delays. He has a lot of trouble with emotional regulation. But he loves animals, and being around animals helps significantly with his emotional regulation. For a while we did animal therapy but sadly his therapist moved away. He’s been begging for a dog since he was 5, but pets were banned in all of the apartments we’ve lived in.  On a whim I called a local no-kill animal shelter to ask if he could hang out with some animals sometimes, I even offered to pay. They not only agreed to let him spend time with the animals for free, they went above and beyond for him. They welcomed him, gave him a tour of the shelter, introduced him to some friendly dogs and cats, and let him play with some dogs in their yard area. They then offered him a volunteer position, which they don’t usually allow kids to do.  So for the last 8 months my son has spent between 6 and 14 hours every week volunteering at the shelter. Frankly, he would live there if he could. He goes for 2 hours after school 3 days a week, and usually for several hours on weekends. His job is to give the animals exercise and get them ready for adoption. He spends time with the animals to help them get used to people, he plays with them, he takes photos of them and makes adoption profiles for them, he walks the dogs, the staff have even been teaching him about dog training so he can help train the dogs. I can’t believe how much it’s helped him. He’s calmer, happier, more confident, more talkative. His speech and reading have improved because he often reads to the shy animals, and he has so much to talk about now. I can never thank the staff enough for how much they’ve done for him.  He gets very attached to the shy dogs, and the staff tell me he’s amazing with them and they’re impressed how much he’s able to help them. There’s one dog in particular he adores. She was abused so she came in very scared and shy, and he’s spent so much time helping her come out of her shell. The staff say she loves him, apparently she lights up when she hears his voice. She has recently become available for adoption, and talked about how sad he is that she’ll be leaving but that he’s excited for her to find her forever family.   He doesn’t know yet that our landlord agreed to allow one dog if I pay a fee. I’ve already talked to the staff and put her on hold. Tomorrow while he’s doing his volunteer work I’ll be signing the adoption paperwork, and when we leave the shelter, she’s coming with us.",

I read this is normal in kids on a few sites but has this happened to anyones child? I have to say she vomits at the drop of a hat so im thinking she maybe just overdid it last night with the running around or maybe ate too much food yesterday that irritated her stomach. She didn’t eat a lot but she did have 1/2 a slice of pizza for lunch and just a popsicle for dinner. Her appetite has been so low so i was happy to give her anything that sounded appealing.

As it’s normal for a teenager to push the boundaries, I sometimes I feel as if he  crosses boundaries. For example, the other day my daughter was walking out of the house with her friend and I hear her giggle and then shout “Mom your boyfriend flipped me off.” Later when I told him that flipping off a 14 year old is not acceptable, he said “she flips me off all the time.” I said “well than as a parent you need to address that issue or talk to me so I can address that issue, but you flipping her off is only condoning the behavior and that’s not okay.”  He said “I don’t see why you’re upset about this.” I repeated myself and then asked “what was your reasoning behind flipping her off? What were you trying to accomplish?” He couldn’t give me a good reason other than “it’s funny,” so I asked “funny to who, you or her?” He said “both.”  So my reply was “flipping off a 14 year old isn’t funny unless you’re also an adolescent as well and you’re being flirtatious.”  He asked “how is that being flirtatious?”  I told him I didn’t want to talk about it anymore and the bottom line was that is an adult and he needed to act as such.   I am already a precautious person because I can be overly paranoid at times but it is little things like this that make my wheels start spinning!

Will he get used to this routine ? I’m seriously considering taking more time off because both my sister and my mom now dread watching him and I’m afraid they will bail with no notice.

    "self_text": "To my knowledge I've never done anything to offend them. I think I'm fairly friendly but also try not to impose on their time. I always send back paperwork or other things they ask for on time. I think my kid is well behaved in class (no complaints and I haven't heard anything troubling). But whenever I interact with her teachers (one teacher and one aide), they barely speak to me and don't make eye contact. Yesterday when I picked my kid up from school, the aide seemed to be openly sarcastic with me (I asked her how her weekend was, since I hadn't seen her the day before, and I think she rolled her eyes and said it was fine).  I know it's been a tough couple years for teachers and I try to be sensitive to that, but I don't get this. I think they treat my kid fairly and that's what matters, but it feels like we should be able to have a friendly relationships. It also makes me wary if there ever IS an issue -- I hope there isn't but with elementary kids you never know what might come up.  Anyone dealt with his before and have advice? Not looking for a best friend here, just a functional relationship. Or do I just write this one off as an off year and hope we have better rapport with next year's teachers?",

    "self_text": "So I just needed to come on here and vent because I have no one else to talk to and I’m absolutely devastated.  My 3yo daughter attends dance lessons one day a week. I have had issues with this dance school in the past, nothing major just some minor annoying things. The class only goes for about an hour in the mornings but some days they finish up earlier and some days it’s later.   I’m 38 weeks pregnant so I need to pee quite frequently! At this mornings lesson, I went to use to the bathroom and while I was in there all the children came out early to the waiting area where us mums sit. I heard them all come out while I was in the toilet and I heard my daughter calling for me so I quickly washed my hands and come out. My daughter wasn’t in the waiting area so I assumed she went back into the hall and went to check, the dance instructors said she wasn’t in there and told me to check the toilet, I knew she wasn’t in there because it’s the only toilet and I was just in there.   I start panicking, and run outside calling her name, I couldn’t see her and I start freaking out even more and checked inside again, she wasn’t there. I heard a mum call from carpark that they have my daughter. In the 20 seconds it took from her coming out of the hall to me leaving the toilet she had run a couple metres up the road to where I had parked my car. A council worker who was mowing the lawn in the park next to the dance hall had bought her back down. It was only 20 seconds but it’s an extremely busy main road, a lot of cars and a lot of people around. Anything could have happened.   It wasn’t until I got her into the car and started driving away that I had realised what could have happened and I started sobbing. My daughter got upset because she thought she was in trouble but I assured her that she did absolutely nothing wrong and it was mummy’s fault for not being there but in the future if mummy isn’t there then to wait with the instructors or on the lounge in the waiting area. I feel stupid for not having that conversation with her earlier.   I feel like the situation could have been avoided in so many ways. She had to go past everyone to get outside and if I could hear her calling for me from the toilet then everyone else definitely would have heard her. The instructors have a duty of care and they should be more attentive, they didn’t even bother to leave the hall to help look for her, not to mention they both work in childcare and are trained in things like this. Also I don’t know why the doors to outside weren’t shut in the first place when there’s a bunch of babies and toddlers running around.   I’m just so mad and while I am upset that nobody noticed my daughter leave, my child is my responsibility and I feel so absolutely horrible and guilty. I would never forgive myself if something were to happen to her. I’m so grateful that she is okay and grateful that the council worker stopped her and asked where her mummy was and bought her back. I’m lucky my daughter has some street sense as this could have ended a lot worse if she had made it on to the road. It was only a fragment of time but anything could have happened in that 20 seconds, it felt like eternity to me and it was the worst experience I’ve ever had as a mother.  ETA: fiancé and I are going to be making a call to the head instructor this afternoon to discuss what happened and hopefully she sees the severity of this situation and that they need a better system in place to avoid this happening again in the future.",

I asked if he was okay with that and he said yes. I told him that was fine, and if he wanted mommy to put it back on I could. I asked him what his dad had said about them and he said that “daddy said it’s only for girls”. I told him that wasn’t true and mostly girls wear it but it’s okay for boys to wear as well.  I then asked him what he said when his dad was taking it off and he said he told him he didn’t want it off. I just reassured him that if it makes him happy then we can still do it and to not let anyone make him feel funny about his choices or what he likes. He told me he wanted the color green next so we’ll see if he asks for it. I’m not gonna push it on him but if he asked me to, I’ll definitely paint them for him.  Thank you to everyone for your reassuring words!

    "self_text": "So for a little context, my in-laws fully believe that because my husband or I respond to our 13m cries (she cries when we leave the room or if her in-laws walk into the room, and has left scratch marks on FIL when trying to get out of his arms) that it's \"spoiling\" and \"coddling\".  It's only the people in that particular household, and I've never seen her get that red from crying except for when she was born. It's absolutely heartbreaking to listen to, you can hear it from outside their house regardless of which room she's in. It's worse when watching them try to calm her down before I or my husband take her because it's almost like watching a caged animal beg to be freed, I also wouldn't want to be trapped in someone's arms when I'm uncomfortable, I don't think it helps her at all.  So I'm wondering about what (if any) studies or developmental educators/health worker books or papers that can be used in my favor. This family (especially FIL) is EXTREMELY inquisitive and logical.   Maybe I'm just reaching here or overreacting? It's been like this for almost six months though and I'm extremely tired of both my husband and I getting accused of spoiling a baby (technically a toddler but definitely doesn't have any form of emotional regulation and her only way to communicate is babbling, grabbing, and crying).

We have stressed to the family on several occasions that we want them to stop and they agree but then they continue doing it. Which is super annoying.  My husband and I have planned on collecting the toys they walk in with and telling them to return it because they don't respect our wishes as parents.

    "self_text": "I have a daughter who is 3 years old and 4 months.  She can very much be a jolly, friendly, sweet, loving, playful, angel who cares about others.  But she has another side that rears its head at least once per day.  This side of her is quick to anger, takes on a harsh/yelling tone, won't share with others, asks to be carried, and has tantrums if she doesn't get her way or if you respond to a question/request in the \"wrong\" way.  Not to make excuses for this behavior, but we did have a new daughter born about 4 months ago.  The daughter at issue also started preschool (5 days per week, 5 hours per day) in September 2022, and recently potty trained around this time as well.  Even prior to all of these changes, which I don't want to discount, she was a fussy baby who showed signs of being easily upset over a year ago at the age of 18-24 months.  She did have bad reflux (we switched to HIPP, which helped), and she saw an occupational therapist around 12-18 months to help her chew solids.  She has also seen a speech therapist and physical therapist to help her be more nimble for her age, both of which have helped, but her intelligibility of language could still use some work.  Sometimes I don't know which side of my daughter to expect.  For example, let's say she asks to watch something on TV in the morning.  If I say \"No, maybe after we get dressed and eat first,\" she might take the response calmly and say, \"Ok, Daddy.\"  Other times, she will get upset, ask why not in a very whiny tone, and overall work herself into a tantrum despite redirection, despite being calm with her, despite being consistent with her, etc.  Other problematic behavior includes asking to be carried often and having a meltdown when we refuse.  She also struggles sharing toys with others and tends to look at things as \"hers.\"   We've worked on sharing, have read books to her, have modeled how to share and how it makes others happy, etc.  But it's still something she struggles with.  I know some of this sounds like typical toddler/preschooler behavior, but recently she'll have meltdowns when other kids don't, like when getting dropped off at preschool (relatively new development - she used to be fine with it, and nothing has significantly changed, though we did change to no diapers about a month ago).  I'm inclined to bring her to a child therapist for an evaluation.  Hopefully they can help us form a game plan.  But I was hoping to get any honest input/feedback from this community.

    "self_text": "I've been getting messages for months asking for an update to my post about my daughter not eating solids at 14 months old. So here's a very overdue update...  She's almost 2 years old now. We stopped feeding therapy at 15 months because we couldn't afford it and we weren't happy with the results. For months, we went back and forth between giving her what she wanted (crunchy snacks), purees or feeding her only what we ate. The latter would lead to her not eating at all. But over time, we've seen slight improvements. At 14 months, she would only drink formula and eat crunchy snacks. Sometimes she'd eat some rice or spaghetti. Around 15-18 months, we transitioned her from formula and tried purees and while milk. We slowly increased the formula to milk ratio in her bottle to get her used to whole milk which worked very well! Parents here aren't going to like hearing this but tbh for a few days, we did force her to eat purees, like force it in her mouth because she'd fight us on it. For us, it only took a few days for her to finally accept purees without a problem. She really loved the fruit ones, chicken/turkey and rice, sweet potato, sometimes carrots. I know she was too old for purees at this time but she was getting calories and enjoying it so I didn't care lol.   At 18 months, we stopped purees completely (though we started doing oatmeal and yogurt since she was used to the texture) to encourage her to eat solids. She would eat french fries, rice or spaghetti (and crunchy snacks of course) consistently but refuse literally anything else (no meats, vegetables or fruits, smoothies, mashed potatoes, etc.). We accepted this for a while because we didn't want to force her to eat other things again. But sometimes, we'd make fish, mix it into pasta/rice and I'd personally feed her so she wouldn't take a close look at it haha (again she was probably too old to be fed but idc). Fish had a similar softness to rice/pasta so it worked sometimes, as long as she didn't look to closely. I did it with french fries as well.  From 19 months to now, she now doesn't like rice, yogurt, or oatmeal anymore so we've introduced meat and fruits/veggies into her diet but limited. She now eats bananas, strawberries, apples/applesauce, cereal, peas/carrots/broccoli (hit or miss), fish sticks, chicken nuggets/bites, dark meat chicken (hit or miss), ground beef only when mixed into pasta, tamales. This was not an overnight thing, it took time. I would only make a plate for myself and have her sit next to me and she'd watch me eat. I didn't pressure her or acknowledge her (but I'd still interact). She'd get curious about what I was eating and notice that I'd put the food in my mouth and not die so she got comfortable asking for the food I was eating haha!   It took months to get to this point and although her list of foods isn't a lot, it's something. We're still struggling with a few things... She still has strong aversions to a lot of food/textures. She sometimes doesn't eat at daycare. She typically eats small portions. She is very small for her age - 22 months and 23 lbs. Her doctor would like her to see a GI specialist eventually. But I just want to let parents who are struggling like me know that you're not alone. It is frustrating watching your child not eat but remember it's temporary! Picky eating isn't new. Picky eaters live to become adults and won't only eat goldfish or chicken nuggets forever. Just always keep trying!",

I know this is the first step; but what’s the second step? I had a friend tell me they woke their son up every 2 hours until he got it himself?!?! (Omg that could take months and I thought this phase of parenting was behind us 😳🤪)   We don’t see the Dr until mid December, so I’m here to ask you:  How did you get your LO into underwear overnight and do you have any tips for keeping the sheets dry?   She’s still on her crib sized mattress, she’s a small kid so she still fits…. I’d kinda like her to get this down before buying her a “big kid” twin mattress.",

I apologized, my son was distraught, and I asked to see the brand marking so I could try to locate a replacement. Turns out, it was made by my aunt (older, about 60 years old) and painted in a ceramics class.   I feel awful--maybe I should make a habit of removing breakables from that space? But there have been grandkids/great-grandkids visiting regularly for more than 5 years at this point, so maybe I shouldn't feel guilty when they certainly had notice that young children (there were 5 of them there today between the ages of 1 and 4) would be there? Also, so many decorations there are breakable, so it feels a bit intrusive for me to move everything in the main living room space.  We are probably going to offer to host our Christmas gathering at our house, between that and the electrical outlets that my 1 year old daughter thought were fascinating today.   Should I have done something different? Solidarity? I feel like a terrible mom, but, logically, I'm not sure that's appropriate judgment on my part. Clear this up for me, reddit.",

Wanting to stay up later (her 2 year old brother goes to bed at the same time as her, we’ve tried separate bedtimes but then I end up spending about 2 hours every evening just putting the kids to bed). I don’t know what it is about bedtimes that just really stress me out, but I  need  things to go smoothly with a routine and no negotiations every step of the way because I’m tired enough at the end of the day.   Last night she stayed up two hours later than usual because we went to my husband’s nephew’s birthday party and still made a fuss about bed and so I gave her two choices - stay up 10 minutes or 20 minutes and then go to bed. She chose 20 and drew for a bit and went to bed without a fuss and I felt like it wa such a victory.   This morning she had a meltdown with my husband about taking a bath, hitting him etc which resulted in a trip after absolute ages to the naughty corner (people don’t often love this I know but we still reserve it for absolute offences like hitting). Then she was so upset about leaving me to go to school - crying about missing me, etc that I figured she just needed connection and I let her stay home so we could hang and put all my plans on hold. Except she spent an hour crying and screaming because k said she couldn’t watch tv if she was going to skip a school day.   We ended up drawing together etc and she was fine - but at bedtime today she started up with the crying about not being able to spend more time playing with her cousin and wanting to be up late.   I snapped - I grabbed her arm, dragged her to her room, shouted at the absolute top of my lungs at her - and seeing her sobbing and cower has just destroyed me. I hate myself so much for intimidating her in that way but at the same time I was so, so, so angry. I felt like she’d completely just walked all over me and I was so resentful about how hard I had tried to not do exactly this - not yell each time she had a meltdown - but it feels like I give her an inch and she wants to take a mile.   I don’t know what to do anymore. I hate myself and hate that I treated her that way. I wonder how much worse it’ll get when she’s a teen and wonder if I’m still going to be shouting at her that way in which case she’ll absolutely hate me the way I did my father for shouting at me and making me feel like scum. I just don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to not shout when I feel backed into a corner.

An opportunity has come up to switch him full-time to the public school.   On paper this feels like the best idea; consistent schedule, higher teacher to student ratio, smaller class, possible extra support for his language development as he has a speech delay. It's a mix class of special needs kids and typical children. However the private school feels more fun; more outdoor time with better playground, allows kids to choose what toys they play with vs public having 'stations' they rotate the kids though, and fun extras like sensory boxes and field trips.   I'm having a hard time making the decision. Switch child full time to the public school or keep him in both? This whole thing came up because he's been having some difficulty, listening to the teachers and behaving in class, with the different teachers reporting different things. Anyone make a similar decision?",

Dad has theorized that I coddle her and that is why she has tantrums mainly with me. I think that it is inevitable that toddlers are going to occasionally not know how to regulate their emotions.  When she cries, I let her cry. Then when she’s ready to be held and talk, I do that. I try to never tell her “don’t cry” or “stop faking” or anything like that, unless it is a small moment that I can see that we can easily distract her and move past it. If she is full on breaking down, I’m going to let her just work through the emotions in an appropriate space (IE if in a public space, we go outside until settled etc).  So settle the debate:  Does she freak more with mom because she feels comfortable to express her emotions, or because I coddle/spoil her?!",

My older child is about to turn 3 and while he sleeps happily in his crib at home, we just visited family over the holiday where he napped and slept well in a bottom bunk (ladder to the top bunk stowed away). Since he was so proud of sleeping in the real bed, we are thinking of getting him a big kid bed for his birthday or Christmas. If we lived somewhere with more space, I'd just go straight to a twin bed, but we are moving later this winter to a new condo where we're planning for him to share a smallish room (10.5 ft by 11 ft) with his baby brother. In order to maximize floor space, I'm thinking to go with a toddler bed for 2-ish years til we can shift both boys to a bunk bed.  I know I'm way overthinking this....but do you think it'll feel special enough to just put the toddler rail on his current crib and have Baby Bro in his matching crib? Or will that seem baby-ish and we should try for something that looks more like a real bed...? Any benefits to a crib-with-rail sort of daybed style vs a toddler bed....?",

He just hates school.  But we cannot seem to find an answer or an ability to make strides. He comes from a very loving home, and there's no concern that the school is mistreating him. Our older child went there and LOVED it. We talk to him regularly about how we love school, praise him for his good behavior, and frequently explain that he is safe without us, and we'll always be there for him when school is over.  It is causing a stress on everyone involved and I feel slightly lost. I feel like an utter failure because I can't seem to help him, and I worry that this will never get better.

    "self_text": "Our son is nineteen. Tonight he's at his brother's wedding an hour and a half from home with his best friend. Love the best friend, known her for years, trust her fully. I asked my son, as I always do when he goes somewhere, to let me know when he gets there. Often he does. Sometimes- enough times (five or so, and I remember them with... clarity) - he doesn't, and we've had conversations each time.   Here are the kickers: -Son is mildly on the spectrum and doesn't handle sudden change well.  -His brother is not our son. Our son was adopted a year and a half ago.  -Also at the wedding are the people who raised him, who haven't seen him since he left their house in the middle of the night. They're awful, homophobic, manipulative, violently abusive people. We went through hell getting him out of there, and I'm terrified because I can't be there the first time he encounters them. He's strong enough, but... you know?   -The violent abuse also involved tracking him. He's very, very edgy about the idea of being tracked/letting people know where he is as a result. He also, however, gets edgy when he does not know where we are. Spouse and I let each other - and let son - know when we've gotten somewhere, so this isn't just tracking, it's family protocol, but I can't handle this the way i would with a kid without trauma. ETA: a big part of why we do this is to help him learn to be accountable and reliable without expecting abuse on the other end. And I'm trying to work out how to handle it when he's not reliable. So far it's been \"I will be ready to go do xyz thing with you when you've cleaned up the thing you were doing in the kitchen\" and \"have fun at bday party tomorrow, please make sure you've finished ABC obligation before you go.\"   -his reason for not letting me know where he is on more than one occasion has been having no service. So we need some kind of backup plan in those circumstances.   I FINALLY got a response from best friend (three hours late) that they're safe and alive, but I've gotta address this with kiddo, and I'm trying to figure out how.   Compounding factors: his depression and anxiety and ptsd and adhd are getting in the way of him caring for his cat. The cat was acquired with certain understandings, and he has not yet done some things he absolutely has to do for the cat. I suspect some of them have become impossible tasks, and he struggles to ask for help, so I'm working through that with him as well.   Any help would be deeply appreciated.",

Now, we call our boys monkeys all the time, and I’m 100% sure that he wouldn’t have said it in a racist way.   The school made me aware of it and I used the opportunity to have a long talk with him about how some words can be used to be cruel or as slurs. That for people with brown skin, being called a monkey is deeply offensive.   Anyway, today at the school gate my wife saw the one of the kids in question point out our son to the child’s mother (who has something of a reputation as an angry parent)   I’ve decided to get ahead of any angry confrontations by seeing if I can talk to her- explain that it was an innocent comment but point out how it’s also completely unacceptable and that we’ve explained all this to our boy.   Is this the right course of action? Should I consider any thing else?  We’re in the Uk btw.   Edit: spelling",

My friends son seems to always have outbursts, doesn't take well to mild discipline (just saying a simple no),  speaks so rudely.  I don't particularly want to approach my friend about his behaviour and I do sometimes intervene when I see fit, but I hold back a lot as he is not my child and I am trying to respect that.  Except at times, I can't handle how rude and disrespectful her son is. The way he talks to my friend is triggering. He could yell at her with no please, no thankyou, and just gets what he wants all the time. Very demanding 24/7. It sounds like such typical behaviour for a toddler but I often feel his outbursts are constant and extreme. You can't make him happy. It's always his way or the highway.  I think what's worse is my friend doesn't seem to tell him off for speaking to her the way he does. If my kids ask and behave that way, I make it pretty clear that I won't tolerate it one bit.   My friends son still uses his Dummy and is in nappies but you can tell he is well and truly ready to stop both. My friend says she's just not ready for him to grow up yet.  He doesn't say sorry when he's done wrong, he demands screen time maybe every half an hour, demands food rudely, he makes such a fuss you never really know what he is saying.   My eldest has said to me at times that he needs a break from my friends son because he's just always crying and screaming about something. My youngest I've noticed changes his actions to try and avoid upsetting my friends child.   I love my friend very much but we have such different parenting styles, and I love her son I do. He does have his good moments. I just don't want to overstep the line with her son. I've told her, if you don't like something I do please say so - I am only treating him the same as I would my own children.  I feel like a bitch writing all of this but I can't help but sometimes wonder if her child has  condition.. or I dare say.. it's just her parenting? I can't put my finger on it. Hard to explain the behaviour I suppose. It does just seem excessive at least 80% of the time.  A bit of a vent but curious on what others would say or do.. or even if you've experienced similar situations?y kids aren't perfect, but they're not rude.",

My daughter is currently 4 years old and my grandmother has been pressuring me to get her vaccinated against Covid, saying that I need to get her vaccinated as soon as possible, but is it really such a dire need?  Now I myself am fully vaccinated but I’m worried that she might be a bit too young for the shot. Is 4 an acceptable age or should I wait a bit longer?  I fully intend to have her vaccinated eventually, she’s currently up to date on all her other vaccines but I will admit that I’m a bit worried that her immune system might have a negative reaction to the vaccine. Should I go ahead and get her vaccinated or should I wait until she turns 5?",

My husband doesn't want me to see my father's daughter anymore we made clear of that in the past and he made it sure that the other people know that he is the biological father of my daughter and even made my daughter have his surname.

I was unaware of this situation so of course I’m going to have a talk with my son and let him know he cannot under any circumstances hit someone and that if someone is bullying him he needs to talk to me or his teacher.  The way it was described to me was my son “shoved the other child in the back of the head”.  He doesn’t like to tell the teacher when he’s having issues socially because he gets made fun of and called a tattle tail. He did get punished by the school (lunch detention) so I’m torn if he should have a consequence at home as well. I will be talking to the school about the situation now that I am aware of it. I never want my son to hit ANYONE however, I also want to raise a child who can stick up for himself so I’m just not sure what to do here.",

    "self_text": "The short version:  I’ve tried to put limits on the kind of food we bring into the house and my husband keeps bringing home junk food, almost everyday. He seems to do it more when he works late or feels guilty. What can I do to get him to stop? He says he doesn’t do it that often or anymore than I do but I know he does.   The long version: I’ll start by saying my husband and I have always struggled with our weight. We were both overweight kids with slim older siblings and slim parents, it’s one of the many things we have in common. In our adult lives we’ve both had periods of average weight, morbidly obese and everything in between. We don’t really know how to eat “normally”. After fighting my weight for years I decided dieting wasn’t going to cut it long term and had gastric bypass surgery in May. I’ve since lost 60 pounds but I’m still obese, I was 280 pounds at the time of surgery. Our son is 14, in the last several years he went from a healthy normal weight to morbidly obese. My husband is in the obese category and today I learned our 9 year old daughter is very close to being overweight. Since I’ve had bariatric surgery I’ve had to see a nutritionist on a regular basis and take classes for proper nutrition and exercise. My husband is a doctor so he should also be well aware of what is wrong with our diet and lifestyle. I’m trying to change, he says he wants to change but never does. I don’t know if I can wait for him to want to change. He thinks I’m blaming him solely for our situation, but I told him I take responsibility for my part in this. I know I probably contributed more to it than he did until recently. I don’t know what else to do and I feel like I’m at the end of my rope.",

If you know what the croup cough sounds like, that’s her typical sick cough. We started up the allergy meds and warm baths but she has no other signs of illness.  I got a call from the school that she was complaining with sore throat and she came back to the nurse claiming she lost her voice. Strep is going around so I go get her but nurse is convinced she’s faking. I pull her and go spend 20$ on pedialyte and stuff, and booked her an appointment for tomorrow with after hours, get home and when she lets the dog out she starts talking. 😞   I’m at my wits end here. She loves school and is excelling yet she won’t stop faking illness at school. We’ve talked about bullies before but she claims school is going great and nobody is bothering her right now. It’s always right after lunch too. She’s had some behavioral issues at home but they are mostly in check now and anyways she’s about to see her pediatrician so I’m going to bring it up.   What do I do? I just pulled her for no reason and I can’t get across to her that this behavior isn’t okay.  UPDATE: So I sat her down and talked to her about it again and explained that no matter what the issue is, she needs to tell me. She says basically she didn’t say anything because she isn’t the only kid with this issue and nobody is helping. I let her know she always can tell me and I will make sure it gets fixed just like always. Turns out she’s being bullied by 3 boys in her class. Apparently lots of kids are. Needless to say the teachers are getting a talk for not intervening enough, the principal has been informed and all 3 boys will be pulled tomorrow by the counselor to discuss behavior and punishment.",

Well, since them he has been super obsessed/scared of the smoke alarms and CO2 detectors in our house, in stores, etc. He wants to watch fire drills and hear alarms on YouTube. It's all he wants to talk about. I have to reassure him every night that he doesn't have to be scared of the smoke detector and that they're there to help him. I know theres going to be more drills eventually. What the heck am I supposed to do! It's like he has some kind of fire drill trauma!! This is a weird one I know, but yikes!",

    "title": "Head Hitting During Tantrums",
    "self_text": "About 3 months ago my song turned 3 years old. He is constantly into everything, so we are in a constant state of redirection and threatening to send him to bed or time out. Just recently he's started to hit his head on things like the floor or wall when he throws a tantrum. Our response is a mix between ignoring him and scolding him and telling him to not hurt himself; be nice to himself. I had a small lecture with him one night in bed after he hit his head on his bed post and I thought he understood what I was saying... as good as a toddler can... but last night when we threatened to send him to bed after pulling his sisters hair he ran to the fireplace and threw his head down on the cement/stone step up to it. I was shocked and gasped. I think he immediately regretted it, but I couldn't be sure since he was in the middle of a tantrum at the time. I'm tired of redirecting, I'm tired of his tantrums, I'm tired of being woken up at 2 am to a tantrum, and I'm tired of him hurting himself. I'm not sure what I can do for him to make him understand that he needs to get some semblance of control over himself. I feel awful that he's hurt himself; he has 4 bruises on his head. I need to figure out how to get him to stop and express himself in another way that isn't hurting anyone.",

    "self_text": "My son (7) does not seem to understand social cues.   Example : we went trick or treating last night and ran into a kid from his class. We ended up joining their group. My son never talks about these two boys and I didn’t even know the one was in his class. The boys did not wait for my son when running from house to house, I don’t think this was intentional, they were excited. Rather than running to catch up, my son would yell the kids name over and over again asking them to wait. Finally, one boy says “stop saying my name every 7 seconds you’re annoying” - later on, fireworks were going off and we all stopped to watch my son and the boy from his class stood and watched and my son was overly excited being loud and exclaiming how cool it was and for everyone to look up. The other boy eventually turned around and started to walk back to his mom. My son started yelling his name and saying the fireworks weren’t done, he kept doing this over and over again.  This is common, even at home. My son will repeat himself over and over again until you fully stop whatever you’re doing and give him your full attention. This happens even if I’m mid conversation with him about a completely unrelated topic.   He seems very immature for his age compared to his peers, he also has a speech impediment that we are working on, so that doesn’t help.   He also is a very out of sight out of mind kid. I put all his Halloween candy in a bowl on top of the fridge and he not once asked about it today. He puts a treat in the fridge and unless I mention it again, it will sit there for weeks.  From a young age (about 3) I noticed he was very particular about things. He would place fallen groceries at the store back on the shelf, and organize all his toys by theme. He still is very skilled at organizing and asks that his things be put back in their “homes” everything has a place. He also thrives on routine, likes to have the weekly menu for each meal written out, and he knows which days are for what activities and he often suggests things like “every Tuesday we should have tacos” or “every Monday after dinner should be swimming night”  I am 32 and was just diagnosed with ADHD. My mom describes my childhood as similar, I also know some of the things I’m noticing are signs of ADHD. I’m just concerned that I’m projecting my diagnosis onto him rather than giving him the grace of being 7 and developing at his own pace.  I feel conflicted on if I should pursue a professional assessment or if I’m overthinking things and this is just who my son is as a person, which is totally fine too. I just would want him to have the supports I didn’t as a child if it were ADHD.  Thoughts and experiences?",

    "self_text": "I’m struggling with how best to help my 4th grader who seems to be falling further and further behind in math and is struggling to complete assignments on time. She is generally an anxious kid with strong perfectionist tendencies. She’s in therapy and I’ve spoken with her teacher a few times, but both her teacher and her therapist were dismissive of the idea of any learning disability or neuro-divergence, and didn’t really have anything to offer in terms of support or coping. Her therapist specifically thought that she was avoiding any assignments she couldn’t do perfectly, but didn’t really have any advice on how to work around that particular road block.  At 9 years old this kid is still often writing her letters and numbers backwards, she often writes very chaoticly with random spacing that doesn’t line up with the words she’s trying to write and stories are not written in chronological order. She often forgets her assignments at school that are supposed to come home, and fails to complete in-class assignments in the time allowed. When confronted with this issue she claims she “already knows” how to do the work and “just forgot” and pretty much shuts down. If she’s in a good mood and I have the time, I can walk her through the assignments or math problems, but I’m solidly not a teacher and very much lacking in the skills to get her up to speed. What would help most in this situation? One on one tutoring? Group tutoring? Different therapist? Do I need to be looking deeper into a learning disability? How do I help?",

For the food, I’m just going to ignore. Talked to kiddo about eating other things and we’ll see how it goes.  Kiddo is 6 and spends the night or weekend at grandma’s house once a month. I know it’s typical for grandparents to spoil the kids but it’s 1am and my kid is awake in bed, eating snacks, watching slime videos on YouTube. Do you turn a blind eye? Ask them to follow loose guidelines? Stick to the rules of your home?   Specifics: Grandma is my MIL and she’s a nice lady but we have 100% opposite personalities. We live very close so we interact a lot. Because of this I just bite my tongue and let my husband figure stuff out when she has our kid. I can’t tell if my annoyance is grandparent-related or MIL-related, if that makes sense.  ** when we have parent-kid slumber parties at home (snacks, movie, share bed) we both pass out by 10:30pm lol",

The problem is, he’s clearly tired at school later in the day, and sometimes he’s cranky at home. He will sometimes refuse to do what his teacher tells him at school, then throw a tantrum. When we call him out on this, he uses being tired as his excuse. (This had been happening before the time change this week, so it’s not that.)  His bedtime is 8:15, which is about as early as is practical for us. He often has trouble falling asleep at night. I tell him to lie still and be quiet in his bed, but sometimes he will get up to get water, or complain to us that he can’t sleep. We tell him he won’t be able to sleep while he’s doing those things. His dad and I have both had or have sleep problems, so there probably is some genetic component.  What can we do to help him sleep better, or at least to understand that, if he’s tired, that’s not a license to act out at school or at home?",

    "self_text": "My son is 2 and a half and just recently started throwing tantrums every day. He screams, hits me and his dad, hits walls, throws anything near him, and won’t calm down for 15-30 minutes at a time. His tantrums start out of nowhere, almost like a switch is flipped. We try our hardest to be extremely gentle with him all throughout the day but it doesn’t help. Recently our neighbors have been concerned that we’re “hitting our children” to the point where every tantrum he has they try to look through our windows. We never hit our kids, we don’t spank or even raise our voice to our kids. While I’m grateful that they care about our kids it’s brought upon an even bigger problem where we’re walking on eggshells with our child and also our neighbor. His tantrums are definitely off-putting but we’ve been told by several people that it’s normal. We’ve also been told it’s abnormal. I’ve been reading about how to help alleviate his moods and help him work through his emotions but even then I’m having to drop everything I’m doing and work with him for 20 minutes at a time at least 4 times a day. He gets exceptionally triggered every day around 5pm asking for his dad while his dad is commuting home from work. Any time dad leaves he tantrums. This morning I gave him a fork for his eggs and had to spend 30 minutes calming him down. And when I say he screams, I mean he SCREAMS. I feel defeated every day and unfortunately I cant talk to my husband because he doesn’t understand. Is this normal behavior? Should I have him tested for autism or adhd?  Edit: Just to add, his outbursts are extreme. He literally beats the heck out of me. I have to hold his arms so he doesn’t hit me in the face. And even then he will literally head-butt me in the chest or I have to bear hug him. I understand how it’s off putting to hear that happening next door. It sounds dramatic but I’m starting to feel like every time he tantrums the walls are caving in and there’s an audience just sitting and watching. I’m an extremely exhausted sahm that does all of the chores and watches another child during the day, so I work but I also stay at home. My husband tries to help but doesn’t, it feels like he makes things worse. So I’m basically alone in this, trying to schedule appointments with our pediatrician to get him into a behavioral program or early intervention. I feel like everyone’s breathing down my neck and I feel like my neighbors are going to call cps. I cry myself to sleep because I feel like I can’t help him, I feel like he’s just like this now. I’ve heard of the terrible twos but this is insane.",

    "self_text": "Long post but here it goes. Want opinions from other parents who smoke. I (31F) and my husband have 3 kids. The first is my stepson (17) and we have had custody since he was 4. Husband smokes on the daily. That used to be me and I'll always be a stoner at heart. Fully support weed. I just get awful anxiety since having my most recent child and so I rarely smoke anymore.   Our 17 year old has been getting into trouble recently and has had a rough year. Actually, a rough past 7 years but this year has been one of the roughest. He's not at all doing hard drugs as we did at his age. But he's been finding his rebellious streak in his own way. We have him working with a therapist to aid in his mental health*   He was recently caught smoking cigarettes in the school bathroom and got ISS for that. We knew he'd been vaping and smoking cigarettes, and told him that he's got to be of age if he's going to smoke (nicotine).  One of my BIGGEST things is that he's super irresponsible and really bad at hiding things. He doesn't wake himself up for school (really our fault as well for enabling) He doesn't brush his teeth; even after I remind him. Bc of that he has to go to the dentist 3x as much for basic cleanings because he isn't taking care of himself or his hygiene. Same goes for showering, laundry, school work. He doesnt even flush after he pees. He's just..incredibly apathetic. And pretty unwilling to show accountability. He's a teenager, totallyyy get that. But if he wants to do grown shit, like c'mon dude. At least do the bare minimum of responsibilities.   We are very open with him and he knows we smoke. We've been open as parents, we've done the strict thing where he was put on punishment when caught smoking cigarettes at school. We've talked, and talked, and talked some more and made it abundantly clear we're here for him.  I walked downstairs yesterday and smelled weed. I straight up asked him if he'd been smoking and he denied it. I looked in a little box on his dresser and no weed. My sister-in-law lives with us and she texted me at 3 AM and said it smelled like bud downstairs. So after he left for school today I checked his room. There was cigarette ash all over the top of his dresser. Found a drawer with vape batteries. Then opened another drawer and found weed, coke cans filled with cigarette butts, and another vape battery.   Just the fact that he had aaallll night to get rid of the evidence and he still didn't do it. Like, common sense my dude. It just feels super frustrating that he doesn't care enough to even try to hide it, especially since A) I was just down there last night asking if he smoked so he had hours to do so and B) He just got off ISS last week from getting caught at school.   My husband wants to start smoking with him. I don't think he should. I think with all the issues he's going through - the line of parent/smoking buddy shouldn't be blurred. I also don't trust him because he's shown that he's not discreet and he's extremely bad at keeping things on the low. I feel like smoking with him, at this particular time in life, is just validating his most recent string of decisions.  I totally get smoking at home is better than going out somewhere and getting it elsewhere. We're not in a green friendly state so it's illegal regardless of age. My gut just tells me that right now he needs parents that help guide him with learning to be more responsible, managing his mental health before smoking on the regular and being open with him that weed isn't bad - but show us that you can be more \"adult\" before you get the few benefits of being an adult. It doesn't feel earned is the really short way of explaining my feelings.   Maybe I'm the asshole and my husband is in the right. Hence why I'm on stoner parent Reddit because I'd love some opinions. Sorry for the book of a post. 🙃",

    "self_text": "My gf's son is 6 years old, and has been having terrors for a few months now.  They aren't night terrors, it happens in the middle of the day: all of a sudden he gets terribly scared, and he runs up to his parent or his teacher, and clenches onto them while screaming out of fright. After a minute or so, he will finally let go. When we ask him about why he's scared, he says it's because of \"the shadow people\". When he was younger (4-5yo), he used to have those child-hallucinations of \"shadow people\" who would look at him from the corner of the house, and he was scared they would take him away. His parents always tried to reassure him when it happened, hold him, console him, but he never really let go of that fear. Nowadays, when we ask him if he sees them now, he says \"no, but im scared that they will come\".   We tried going to a psychologist, who has been unable to make a clear diagnosis. She asked to look for the triggers, so she could have more to work on.  We have a strong feeling that anxiety has a big role to play in the start of the terrors. Either when he's feeling ignored, or at a loss of control, or under scrutiny, he's more prone to terrors.   At it's worst, it could happen up to 10-15 times a day, other times he will be fine for 2-3 days in a row.  This is obviously very distruptive to those around him, especially when it happens in school. The other kids are starting to stay away from him and reject his presence. His teacher and the principal have called the parents to explain that this behavior will require the school's neuropsychologist's help to keep it in check.   Has anyone here experienced something similar? Is there a trick to help him express his anxiety in a more healthy way?",

Husband and I alternate weekends off to be with our daughter. She is our only at the moment.  My husband and I are fighting over parenting duties. My daughter almost 3 years old has been on a mommy kick which seems like forever. If we are both home she will only want me to change diapers, read stories, bath, bedtime, ect.  Last night I think I reached a point where I snapped. I come home later than normal (had an errand to run) and I dont get even 5 minutes to decompress from work also he hasnt even fed her dinner yet. I asked him several times to read her a bedtime story so I could have a few minutes. That was unsuccessful. Husband told me that she only wants me. He doesn't want to read to her when she crying and screaming. I told him I need a few minutes to myself. He like she be in bed in 5 minutes so you can have all your me time you want. I yelled that's not fair, I wake up in mommy mode get her ready for daycare, drop her off and go to work, come home and spend the next 2 hours feeding, playing and bedtime routine.  12 hours of no down time/me time other than the breaks I took at work. He did get her out of bed in the am (after I texted him to from the shower) and changed her diaper and he picked her up from daycare, that all the parenting duties he did yestersay.   Husband told me she just going through mommy phase and I just need to wait it out. I said we'll your not helping sitting on the side lines waiting for her to want you. It doesn't work that way. You need to just take her and read her a story whether or not she wants you to or not.   He told me I'm ruining our relationship because I'm taking my frustrations out on him because my daughter only wants me. He says it's not his fault she doesn't want him. I said being in mommy/work mode 12 hours a day is ruining my mental wellbeing. He says she is fine with him when I'm not around.   All I want is 50/50 parenting duties. I know on days he works I have to do it all because he is gone before she wakes up and is home for the last 15 min of bedtime.   How can I make him see that he needs to put more effort into parenting when I'm around or otherwise I will go crazy?",

    "title": "Being a father and dealing with emotions",
    "self_text": "Edit  Spelling errors  Being a father and dealing with emotions  Growing up my dad was very much a tough love kind of father. Not complaining, just indicating how I was raised. He never really gave compliments and would point out ways I could improve things, anything. For example, I had a 99.7% in calculus my senior year of high school. I remember him specifically asking \"what happened with the 0.3%?\". Now before you think I'm ripping on the guy, I'm not. It wasn't until I was an adult I appreciated having a father like that and probably why I have the drive I do today.  He would tell me he loved me when I told him, which was daily btw, but he was definitely not someone that really showed emotion towards me. My first semester freshman year of college I came home for the first time during the Thanksgiving break. My mother was so delighted to see me, big hug, probably tears, and telling me she's so glad to have me home for a bit. Dad though, I'll never forget this, was laying down on the couch watching something. He didn't say a word when I walked in so I said hello. I asked him what he was doing and he said, verbatim \"Hello Charles, I'm clearly watching TV. What are you doing?\" I chuckled as that is such a response my father would have and said \"Great to see you too dad.\" Wasn't upset, that's just how he was.  Anyways, fast forward to this morning when I got home from the gym. I pulled into our garage and saw our door open and the top of my son's head above the staircase. He was squealing because he was so excited to see me. For those of you that don't know, he's also 3 years old. I opened up the door and said 'hey buddy' and he didn't even respond to that, he said \"will you play hide and go seek with me?\" I smiled real big and told him of course I would and we did for a bit.  That feeling I had when I pulled up and my son was squealing because he was so excited to see me was probably one of the top 3 best feelings I've ever had. I remember being that excited to see my dad as a kid and it got me questioning if he was made this happy when me or my brothers were excited to see him. If he did, I never knew and he definitely never showed that to me.  I hope that I continue to express to my son and daughter how much they mean to me and how happy they make me. I feel like as a father, I'm typically expected to be stern and solemn like my father was. Maybe I'm wrong and times are changing from when I was a kid. Either way, I like the feeling I had this morning and want to continue to foster and nurture that reaction from my kids for the rest of my life.",

    "self_text": "** trigger warning**  I feel like I need to be happy & smiling for the kids but god it’s so hard. I paste on the smile all day and pretend it’s all ok.   I began the foster process for my niece (13) in May, there has been a lot of delays. It wasn’t in my life plan but it was the last step before she’d go to a care home. I’ve never let her go, I’ve known her since birth. I love her.  She arrived a very mixed up and upset child but I feel like she’s made good progress.   My 16 yr old niece still lives with her dad, though he is never around. Comes back maybe once a week. She recently attempted suicide and as she listed me as her next of kin, I spent a week in hospital with her. The social have asked I visit/contact her once a day to ensure she’s ok. I need to look after her medication an make sure she doesn’t try to OD. The social have asked I invite her for tea 2 or 3 times a week as she’s developed an eating disorder.   I’m trying to coordinate their doctor’s appointments, dentists, opticians, hearing etc etc. I’m attending the meetings with social for both of them.   I’ve brought the 16 yr old lots of presents for Christmas so she’s not left out, I want her to spend Christmas with us but I’m not sure she will.. she’s also coming on holiday with us in feb, she joins us on days out etc.   I get financial support for the younger one which really helps. My toddler is amazing, he’s coping with all of the changes well & has started nursery full time to account for me starting university.   I’m struggling at uni, with all the appointments, the recent admission to hospital, plus general sickness of the kids I’ve had time off I feel guilty for. How on earth do other single parents balance this all? My flat is tiny, the 13 yr old sleeps on my sofa. Sometimes it feels so crammed, I wish I could do better, that this all came naturally to me. I’m trying so hard to protect them and give them all happy lives.  *EDIT..   I’d like to thank you all for your replies, I’ve reread them many times for a pick me up 🙏 and I’ll read them again on my down days. I’ll speak to social services about how I’m stretching myself thin and that if they could perhaps take the kids to some of the appointments so I can still attend university more often. I’ve worked hard to get to uni so I really don’t want to defer, it would be a last resort.   I’ll also look into groups/activities or hobbies for the older one. The 13 yr old isn’t keen on the local activities offered but we make time to do ‘murder mystery boxes’ we order online- it follows a storyline etc etc, she loves it 😂 hopefully I can find something to do with the 16 yr old that I can give her my whole attention too.   It was mentioned about the 16 yr old living with me, honesty I would love her to stay here. Her current accommodation is horrific, she suffers in neglect. No carpets, windows smashed, 2 garden chairs instead of sofas. The dog was hungry & unfed (my niece didn’t have the money to feed him) the list could go on. When I saw it my heart wrenched. I couldn’t believe how bad it was. I almost cried next to the ambulance crew. But the social services can’t be ‘seen to supporting her living in an accommodation they want her to move out of’ or something like that. Unfortunately the 16 yr old says the house is too busy, she needs space & I get that.. I wish I could change her mind though. She’s a stubborn one! X   But again, thank you so much for your responses, thank you for not judging me, I really am trying.",

He said I know what's best for our baby and he told me I'm a great mom and thanked me for all my hard work. It was very nice to hear. Hopefully next time will go smoother. I appreciate everyone's advice and I will take it into consideration so we can have a better visit.  We have a 7 month old and we try to visit in laws at least twice a month. Every time we go I'm always the one to let my partner know that it's time to go home, which is usually around 7 or 7:30. Sometimes later.  Every single time I get ignored for at least 30 minutes to an hour. I know my baby and I know when it's time to go because she's getting tired from all the stimulation. My partner always makes comments either before we go there or after that I'm too strict and I should relax about going home so early.   This last time was not good because we went there after going grocery shopping, baby hadn't eaten very well and did not get her normal naps. I said we should go around 7:30. She kept getting passed around. His sister tried to put her to sleep. She gave her to his mom. His mom gives her to me and he takes her and gives her back to his mom. Finally we leave by 8 pm and she was crying most of the way home.  We ended up fighting about it. He says I don't like going to inlaws and that's why I always want to leave. I told him I'm just thinking about the baby and has nothing to do with anything else. I knew she was exhausted. He thinks we can just put her to sleep there and stay longer. I feel like this can't go on like this any longer. I'm getting so tired of feeling like I'm always doing something wrong. It doesn't matter what time it is he will always say I want to go too early and that our baby can handle a change in her routine every once in a while.   I'm the one who puts her to sleep and wakes up 2 to 3 times a night to feed her still so I think I should have a say about what we do with her. I'm EBF.",

I didn’t want that for my kids, so went with the gentle-parenting approach.  My daughter is recently two. EVERYTHING causes a meltdown (No, she is not on the spectrum. Yes, I’m sure.)   Being told no. Being told yes. Being given something. Having something taken away. Doing something she didn’t ask you to do. Doing something she asked you to do. The list goes on and on.  I’m at my wits end. I cannot take anymore “explaining” to a screaming child.  When she melts down, she hits me, herself, or objects/walls/floors. She screams. She throws things. She’s inconsolable and won’t listen.  Sometimes, she’ll say things like “don’t touch it” “give it to me” etc etc, and I’ll try to explain that there’s a better way to get your message across, just to be blatantly ignored, OR she’ll tell me no or to go away or not talk to her.  No, I don’t just let these things happen. I try to correct them. I’m not okay with them. I’m not a “pushover”, as some have come to call ‘gentle parenters’, which is a weird term in itself but that’s a discussion for another time.  I feel awful as, this morning, she woke up and automatically flew into a fit because she wanted an orange but not THAT orange. She threw it at my face, and I instinctively popped her mouth. I immediately felt terrible, and it obviously just made things worse.   I don’t want to use physical punishment- I don’t support it. I don’t know what to do.  We’ve tried talking. Comforting/consoling. Explaining. Time outs. Removing her from the situation. Removing objects related to the situation. Ignoring.   I don’t know what else to do.  When she loses it, she screams, cries, and will thrash and get worse if you try to touch her.  She’s with me half the day, then with her grandparents/dad the other half (we all live together). I will say that my parents let her get away with too much (she’s the first grandchild), but I can often hear and get there to interject and try to correct it.  I just don’t know what to do.  I’m due in less than a month. I’m so tired, and I don’t want these issues migrating to the next kid. I don’t want them getting worse, or becoming permanent.   My aunts/uncles have well behaved kids, but they’re afraid of their parents- like I was. I don’t want that.   And I don’t know how much my toddler actually understands of what I’m saying- her speech is still forming.  Please help me. I don’t want to keep longing for the times she sleeps, and fretting the moment she wakes up.   Please no “wait it out” comments.  I do understand that toddlers have tantrums and such. They are still learning to regulate their emotions- as am I. I’m not looking to get rid of them completely, just lessen them and find better coping strategies for her AND me. I just need less freak outs than multiple an hour, and to be better at handling them. I have SPD (a sensory processing disorder), so my main method so far has been to just dissociate so I don’t freak out myself. And the hitting/throwing triggers my PTSD & flight or fight, which I’m working on in therapy  (I fcked up by losing my temper and getting physical, like I’ve said. I want to figure out ways to do and be better. Hateful comments will not help. I feel awful for what I did, and don’t want to ever, ever again- which is why I’m seeking HELP)",

Grandparent is saying the usual \"eat your dinner, eat up, is that nice, yum yum, etc\" but nonstop, and obviously the wee one just wants look round all the time. So we keep asking them to try to ignore him during dinner as he doesn't know what you are saying and you're just distracting him.  Then they make some smart arse comment and go in a huff.  EDIT: Thank you all for your feedback. I'll admit I was on a bit of a rant as this is one of a bunch of low level annoyances and was aimed more at grandparents attitude towards a polite request rather than the specific situation.  The comments vary from one extreme to the other, so I think a happy middle ground would be to not sweat the small stuff and enjoy the time they have together, but try to explain our requests to reinforce our boundaries.

    "self_text": "My daughter (12) has missed almost a month of school due to a GI issue that we cannot pinpoint. She has nausea and vomiting each morning and sometimes randomly throughout the day. She says it’s a feeling at the top of her throat like she is going to throw up. We have been to multiple doctors and even work with a psychiatrist for stress/anxiety but nothing is working. We are at our wits end as she is falling behind in school and the school will eventually take action against us. We have set up a 504 plan for her so she has a resting place during the day and can use the restroom at any point but even this isn’t helping. We are looking at online school but that is a very tight option for us as we are both working parents. Ughhh. Has anyone gone through anything similar? Any help is greatly appreciated.  UPDATE: Just wanted to post an update. We transferred my daughter to an online school (Full Time). She is doing really well at it and has taken a lot of responsibility to keep up with it. I am very proud of her and I am trying to tell her that more.   Her stomach symptoms went away for a while but are now coming back. I think some stress was relieved and that made her feel better but she is now coming up against a lot of stress from my wife who is now trying to work from home and be a teacher at the same time (My job is making me work in the office, sigh). I am convinced her symptoms are being caused by stress.   I have quite a challenge ahead of me as this has made mom very very depressed. One step at a time i guess.   Thank you all for you kind and considerate comments. I so appreciate it.",

I need room in the cart for buying the stuff. This did not go over well. He was yelling and whining and trying to stop me from pushing the cart, etc. I stayed calm and explained and tried to redirect him with things like, “you can help me pick out ‘x’” or “we need to find this next” but he wasn’t buying it. A couple times he just sat down and refused to walk. I know I sprung it on him and he was surprised and mad about it, which is understandable but I don’t know where to go from here.

No rhyme or reason as to how and why it moved.  It kept moving all day but it was manageable.  We emailed doctor and he thought a food allergy.  Today, it was behaving the same way, moving around but manageable.  But around 3pm, he took a nap and his whole body flared with the rash.  His whole body had the rash and he was itchy all over.  We took him to urgent care and they believe it’s hives.  But they also said it could be allergies.  They gave him Benadryl and an anti inflammatory.  The rash is not completely gone but he is much better.  I’m just putting out there to see if anyone has had a similar behaving rash and if they ever came to a conclusion.  Thanks.",

I’d love to get input from people who have actually had nanny shares to make sure we are not being buttholes!    Do you provide food for your nanny or are they expected to bring their own snacks/lunch? If you provide food, are you like taking orders or just telling them to help themselves to the fridge? (Obvi if I’m home making a sandwich I’d offer her one, but we rarely keep lunch stuff around so trying to see if we’d need to stock this)    how do you split up pay with the other family? For example, if one family “hosts” every day, do they pay less because they are providing the location (and possibly food, depending on answer to first question)? Or do they pay more if the nanny spends her extra time w general tidying and laundry and stuff (plus the convenience of not driving?) Or do those things net out so everyone pays the same?    -how much PTO do you provide, if any? Additional perks that I should consider?  It would be super helpful if you could mention in you comments whether you’ve had a nanny (like consistently a few days a week, not a babysitter) or nanny share, or if you’re a nanny yourself, or just chiming in. Definitely open to everyone’s opinions but the context would be useful!",

She's such a great kid, developing well, fun to be around, and a bundle of joy, but I feel like her feeding development has been a bit slow lately, and was wondering if someone had some good advice for me here?  She currently is on 2 naps a day, feeds with three 7-8oz bottles of formula (fed right when waking up from sleep or naps) and supplement it with 1-3 fruity / savoury puree pouches (100-125ml ea) about 2h after her milk. She has no physical problem sucking on her pouches or being spoon fed their contents, however she always fights us when we feed us the savoury stuff and we often have to give in to feeding her yogurt or conceal her savoury stuff under a layer of yogurt on her spoon. She really struggles with textures and anything lumpy and just ejects them from her mouth with her tongue.  We tried to do some baby led weaning for some time, but because of our busy lifestyle, and we had to travel a lot without a decent set up for the mess it creates, we had to abort and continued with spoon feeding. We still do about 1 meal a day where, after feeding her, we drop some finger foods on her table that she picks up, brings to mouth, and nibbles on slightly, but none of it actually makes it down. No proper chewing or swallowing.  Everywhere I read it feels like 11 month olds should be able to cope with textures and finger foods. Some say she should be able to self feed with a spoon.   I guess my questions are :    what do you think would be the best way for me to progress with textures, and solid chunks?  should I stop giving on to the yogurt? Am I just training her to be a demanding picky eater?  should I be training her to use her own spoon now?  any other advice?   Thanks everyone for your help. Happy to provide more details.  Edit : she is 10 mo old, turning 11 mo at the end of the month. Sorry for error in the title",

    "title": "Father Spiraling into Depression",
    "self_text": "I'm approaching 40yrs old with a 6wk old, struggling for two reasons mainly: I never had a desire to have kids and my relationship and life with my wife was perfect before our child. Some more context and advanced apologies for length:  Never in my life did I want kids or think about raising a family, but I met my (perfect) wife six years ago and after a while she began expressing interest in possibly having a child someday. After years of research and discussing pros and cons, we decided to start trying. One of my main motivators, apart from wanting a happy life for my wife, was that no matter how horrible the stories I heard were, they were ALWAYS tinged with this sense of happiness and joy (even if in the moment the parent wanted to give away their baby, or worse!). I figured this joy was an instinctual switch that flipped once the baby was born and was something I wouldn't understand until I was a father.  This has simply not happened for me. If anything the feelings I had before are amplified and I now find myself in fits of depression because I didn't just compromise my beliefs, but did it in such a way that has forever-lasting physical, mental, and financial impacts on me and the ones I love. This isn't just a dad's post partem depression that will pass--I loathe the \"it gets better\" cliche advice. This isn't about losing sleep in the early stages of raising a child and most people giving that advice always wanted kids, had something missing from their lives beforehand, or there's some other pre-existing bias.  The second issue is that the relationship between me and my wife was perfect and there was nothing critically missing from our life. She felt a baby was the natural next step and on top of that was feeling disconnected from family given we had been out in NYC for years while both of our families are 3k miles away. We've had open dialogue about these feelings.  Selfishly I still get depressed knowing we can't go to spontaneous shows, museums, restaurants, bars, etc. which we were doing 2-3 times a week out of pure fun. We've both been through our own rough times before meeting each other so this was always a welcome relief. It might seem immaterial and petty, but we were truly partners in crime and loved doing everything and anything together. We're both nerds and don't have friend groups that we hang out with regularly, we fill that role for each other. So bringing all that to a screeching halt for the next 18 or so years (probably more, given we'll eventually need to move to the suburbs, probably in a new state) is incomprehensible. My wife has been incredibly generous by suggesting I go to the park for a break, grab a bite or drink at our favorite place just to get away, but none of that interests me without her. From here on out we won't get that sort of time together again until the baby is old enough for a babysitter and even then we're only getting a couple hours.   It's utterly depressing that what we'll consider happy or fun 1:1 moments going forward are only happy or fun because they're an escape from the difficulties of this new life. In the meantime I have to force myself to enjoy doing the things we used to love on my own, as a release, otherwise all this depression and anxiety gets worse I guess. In a year I'll probably think these things are enjoyable alone as I become desperate for relief, and I hate it.  We're becoming the stereotype of exhausted parents having to scrounge for enjoyable private moments while eating and sleeping whenever we can, usually not together. And we CHOSE this.   On top of all this, it tears me apart to see my wife cry every week from exhaustion and stress. And this is after a delivery that almost killed her. I hate that we volunteered for this.  Everything is validating my prior beliefs and I have yet to hear a convincing, selfless argument for having a child. The only way this becomes \"better\" is that the memories of the prior life fade and become less tangible, while the space is filled with these new memories, and the bar for \"happy\" and \"fun\" moments becomes excruciatingly low.  For now I'm seeking therapy to try and get clarity on these feelings. Meantime I'm supporting my wife in any way imaginable so she maintains her sanity. Not sure where I go from here.",

    "self_text": "My seven year old, I believe suffers from anxiety. She's not received a formal diagnosis, but when I talked to her pediatrician last year, the doctor recommended therapy. We've done therapy for about 8 months and then her therapist left the practice. I'm having a hard time finding another therapist in our area for her age group. I reached out to the school counselor and she started seeing her once a week.  We went to the dentist today for a regular cleaning, which is always an ordeal but today was terrible. She let the hygienist brush her teeth with a regular tooth brush but wouldn't cooperate to get fluoride or x-rays. She was crying and yelling about how scared she was. Finally I said, okay let's go and we just ended the appointment. And I didn't let her get a prize because she didn't finish the appointment. So then she refused to leave. I had to almost drag her out of the office. She's seven. She's too big for me to carry out like I used to.   It was awful. She's got her regular check up with the pediatrician next week so I'm going to bring up what happened at the dentist.   I don't want this for her. I know she's scared, I know in that moment she's miserable but I don't know what to do to help her. We've tried all the tools from the therapy. I had her calming kit and tried breathing, did all kinds of prep and practicing to get her ready for the dentist but nothing worked. I've been sympathetic, I've been firm, I've offered rewards, I've done all the things.  Can anyone tell me if this will get better? I'm so discouraged and beat down.",

    "title": "Halloween was a flop",
    "self_text": "I’m super disappointed right now. Halloween has been my favorite holiday for awhile, and I was so excited to share the magic to the kids. We went to a trunk-or-treat thing that had maybe 8 cars, then another one that was just finishing shutting down as we arrived. Then we went to my favorite neighborhood during Halloween- full of people with plenty of money to go all out on decorations. One house even does a fog machine with lights and music, as well as amazing decorations. It’s a community neighborhood, with 30+ houses. We got there at 7:30 and got to visit maybe 7 places, everything else was done for the night including my favorite house. Trick-or-Treating was supposed to end at 9:00 and almost everyone shut down over an hour early.  We got turned around and had to walk around quite a bit to find our car, and the kids were whining and wanting to home the whole time. They didn’t have hardly any fun at all, and we got home with almost empty bags. I’m so sad for them, I’ve been hyping up Halloween for months because it’s my favorite and it usually goes so much better than this. Now we have to get disappointed kids ready for bed because they’re exhausted from walking.  EDIT: I’ve gotten a lot of comments, some good and some bad so I figured I’d add on a bit to clarify a few things. For starters, this was my first time taking the kids and I did try to plan ahead, but all of my suggestions were kind of thrown out the window. I tried to get my bf to start costume shopping at the beginning of October, but he didn’t want to until the week before so the kids got some decent costumes but we had to ask my bf’s sister to find buckets the day of Halloween because the store was out. I asked multiple times if we could pick the kiddos up early from daycare and was told no. I was trying to get ready to go when they got home but it took at least half an hour before we left because he wanted them all to eat first, and he wanted to be the one to get them ready. Then my bf and his sister decided to go to the Trunk or Treat events even though the original plan was to just go to a neighborhood. I’m not saying I’m not at fault, I could have pushed harder to actually have a plan and not set everyone’s expectations so high. It is just a holiday after all. Next year I hope I can have more of an input, or I might just see if we can do other events over the weekend and do stuff at home on Halloween like many have suggested. I got overexcited and I think my disappointment rubbed off on the kids. I’ll try to do better for them next year.",

It also wakes up everyone in the house, including his 5 year old sister, and is having a big impact on everyone.   He goes to bed around 6:45pm, but depending on his mood will be asleep between 7pm and 8pm. He typically naps about 1.5 - 2 hours.   Based on other things we've read, one of us will get up and make him stay in bed until 6:30am, but it doesn't appear to be doing anything. The room is dark. He has white noise. We've done sleep training so that he doesn't rely on us to fall asleep (at bed time and if he wakes up during the night, he goes to bed on his own).

    "self_text": "Just an observation:   My husband and I are both very involved in the care of our baby, as we should be. Baby has had a health issue that took some figuring out at first, so we've had a few more doctor's appointments than is normal for 3 months, as well as one ER visit. Usually, either me or my husband take the baby to the doctor alone, though it really makes no difference to us which parent takes the baby - we communicate well and the same info gets communicated either way, because we go with a list. But on a couple of occasions - the ER, baby's 2 month well visit, and a trip to a specialist - though my husband and I both attended the appointment, I noticed that the doctors didn't address my husband at all and only spoke to me.   I am a nurse, so my husband is happy to let me do the discussing because he has the impression that I know better what to ask/what's relevant, but I don't really feel that that's true and I think we both do a good job articulating our questions and concerns.   When we saw the specialist, they sent us home with a printout of the visit summary, and on the paper under the \"patient presenting complaint\" section, it said \"baby has XYZ symptoms, per mom\".   But dad was there too, and dad chimed in equally. The paper easily could have said, \"xyz symptoms per dad\" or \"xyz symptoms per parents\".   I find myself frustrated by this, because yes, I'm the baby's mom, but my husband is the baby's dad, and that means just as much. Ultimately any medical decisions would be made jointly, and I guess I'm bothered on my husband's behalf here. It's interesting to me that there seems to be a habit for healthcare providers to preferentially speak to/listen to mom, as opposed to dad.   I'd be curious to know if anyone else has experienced this?",

    "self_text": "So I've posted in here and it's been helpful so here goes. I was lucky to grow up with my mom and 2 father figures My biological father did always provide financial support but my uncle Scott was always there for me when a dad should of been. I would like to add my dad and Scott were not actually related but best friends for so long they were like brothers. Now my uncle Scott had 2 children, his eldest James in 99 but him and his wife discovered they were better as Coparents than married. Scott was always there for James and myself and my sister. In 2008  Scott met a woman half his age and in January 2009 they welcomed a beautiful baby girl. Well the woman thought she wanted to be a parent but she ultimately chose drugs and abusive relationships over her own child. I was 16 when Rose was born and about to graduate high school when Rose's mother left. It was a difficult battle but Scott was able to get full custody of Rose and after I graduated I stepped in and took care of her when he worked. I played with her, taught her how to walk,  count, how to read. I helped potty train and learn basic hygiene honestly dedicated my life to helping raise her. When she started school I realized it was time to get a real job. Even then I still helped her with homework and summer school lessons so hopefully she wouldn't be behind when the school year started. Because of the 10 year age between James and Rose they weren't as close as most sibling which is normal with that big a gap anywho Scott had an alcohol problem to deal with pain. (He was a mail man and was hit on the job ended up having back surgery which barely helped so he drank to help with the pain)  2016 was the worst year of my life, we celebrated Rose's birthday in January then a month to the day later Scott was dead...... I don't want to get into the details of how Rose got put in the system but she went to the foster parents that had her 2 younger half brothers which she knew all of them just wasn't close. Anyways I did try to comply with all the things CPS said I would have to do to get custody but at the time I couldn't find a place to rent big enough nor did I make enough money. Rose's foster parents would let is visit so we decided that would be enough since we couldn't get her. Well Rose's life just drastically changed and she was having problems minding her foster parents because she saw us as parents so they decided to cut contact with us until Rose would mind them better which lead to them cutting contact completely. James was in his senior year when Scott passed and despite everything graduated valedictorian and got a full ride scholarship to  private school that's one of the best in the country. We were all super proud of James. His campus was only about an hour away so when James could he would get Rose and allow us to see her but with his school load that honestly didn't happen much except around holidays but after James went off to medical school (have I mentioned how proud we are of him) he didn't have time to see her or us much. For a long time I felt that since I failed Rose I didn't deserve to be a parent.. after wrestling with my own mental health and with some therapy I got past that and well in December 2021 I welcomed a beautiful baby boy into this world now that all that info is there here is what happened   It was Halloween a few days ago and our town does this thing called trick or treat on main where all the business on main Street hand out candy so me my child and my boyfriend met up with my sister and her best friend  and her 3 kids. My attention was on the kids and keeping our group together. We had a great time took a long of pictures   got a lot of candy. Well that night I got back to my nanas, my Nana worked with the foster mom a long time ago so they are Facebook friends, she asked me if I wanted to see Rose so I pulled up her Facebook and.... I realized... I saw Rose when we were there... in the first 10 minutes.... and we were maybe 6 to 8 feet apart and I didn't recognize her.... as you can tell I'm messed up by it. I can't stop spinning. Did she see me? Did she recognize me? Are her feelings hurt because I didn't say anything to her? Or because she saw me with my child when I failed her?  So here's the advice I'm asking how can I move past this? I can reason and rationalize but it doesn't stop me from going round and round again and at this point spinning is about to turn into spiraling. Any and all advice welcome. Also if there is a better forum for this please let me know. Also Rose if this finds its way to you somehow I will always love you. My plan is to find you when you turn 18 and let you determine if you want me in your life. I hate I got more time with your dad than you did and I want you to know the good things about him.  Edit to add. The foster parents did adopt her and I'm happy she is loved and taken care of, I just miss my little girl who with their guidance has become a beautiful young woman.  Also wanna add that the names I used are not name they go.",

We are planning to send him to daycare from 9 to 5, which means he will have to take 2 to 3 naps there. I am really concerned whether he will be able to go to sleep there without the help he usually needs to fall asleep.  My baby does not go to sleep on his own. We usually rock him to sleep, or he sleeps in the stroller or carrier. Putting him down drowsy but awake just does not work for us. I used to stress a lot about him not being able to go to sleep on his own. But I managed to accept the fact that he needs us to help him with it, which made the parenting journey so far much less stressful.  I used to think that once he goes to daycare, he will have learnt it already or hopefully learn to sleep independently at daycare. It was also so far away still! But now that he will start soon, I am concerned he might not sleep at all! The teachers at daycare already told me that they cannot do much, stay with him for a little while max. And that in the worst case he would just have to stay up until we collect him. But that sounds cruel, if not impossible, for an 8-months old.  Can someone please give me a word of hope?

It’s a powerful thing the moment you realize how much your child has grown and that one day they won’t be so little.   There’s feelings of guilt , scared you might miss a big moment or become preoccupied with the newborn and how that may make your first child feel.

He’s just content. At night he sleeps 3-4 hours consistently before needing a feed, and those times are slowly getting longer. I take him on weekends at night so mom can get some sleep, and so as much as I can for her and the baby the rest of the time when I’m not at work. I love it.

    "self_text": "Hi, dad here of a 5 year old and a 10 month old.  We’ve had a nanny since our 5 year old was born. The costs have slowly but surely eaten us alive. My wife and I have seen our incomes rise steadily since the oldest one was born, and we’ve both taken on second jobs, but we’re renters and have had to move a few times since then, each time with the cost of our rent going up. Also, as our eldest got older, we increased the nanny’s hours, and have increased her rate year over year and more so since we now have a second. These basically cancel out our income increases and leave us living close to paycheck to paycheck.  We’d someday like to own a home, but it’s hard to see a financial path forward while we’re still paying these costs. In NYC, where we live, we’re paying about $4-4200 per month on childcare, almost an entire second rent. To be clear, we LOVE our nanny and she is truly magical, like a third parent. I know the day our kids age out of her care will be one of the hardest for us as a family, but we are so emotionally and financially drained by this season of life.  Folks who’ve been through this/are going through this, how do you cope? Is it just knowing that this is all temporary and you’ll someday have financial freedom again?",

I remember with my first he was on the mat a ton and rolling up on his side; he rolled over by 3 months, which I realize is a little early.   I don’t have my 3m old on the mat that much, I realize, for a couple reasons:    He’s my last baby and I just want to hold and cuddle him all the time, and he has a disposition that makes it easy to cuddle him. He’s super chill and interactive and begs to be cuddled lol   I’m keeping up with my toddler (2y), often leaving the room where the mat typically is and chasing the toddler around in other rooms. Since I can’t supervise the baby on the mat while chasing the toddler, I often just put the baby in his bassinet because that feels safer.    He hasn’t shown any interest in rolling on his side much yet so I’m wondering if I’m not giving him enough time on the mat to do so.   Thoughts? Advice? Thanks!",

They expected me to stand in reception and check her hair for anyone to walk by and see. I can’t see what more I can do other than keep her off school I’ve asked to do that but her headteacher still wants her attending school surely it would be better to keep her home and prevent it spreading? I’m in the uk and if I keep her off without schools approval it’d be classed as unauthorised absences.  Is there anything I can do or try to help get rid of them quicker? Buying treatment & supplies is getting expensive my child has really long thick hair so it’s a nightmare going through it. I’ve heard diluted tee tree helps repel them so I’ve been spraying my own hair and her baby sisters to hopefully prevent us catching them.",

We are close to her parents, her twin brother is also my son's friend, and my daughter did stage crew for the play that the girlfriend was in last year so they are friendly as well.   Overall, I would say this has been a good thing. We have hosted her parents for dinner and game nights. We have gone to their house to watch movies and play cards. Their daughter tags along with us to our son's sporting events and we go to her musicals. Over Thanksgiving break both of my kids went with the girlfriend and her twin to see a movie and then went bowling after. We know the parents well enough to know where they stand on certain issues (i.e they are not comfortable with sleepovers so we respect that boundary). The girlfriend spends a lot of time over our house and we have no complaints. Their relationship seems healthy.  Yesterday the girlfriend's dad invited my son to a local NFL game. He has season tickets but none of his kids like football so he normally goes solo or with his wife, who also doesn't like football. My son loves football so he jumped on board when the dad asked him. The mom sent me a photo of them before they left and joked that she thinks her husband will take a breakup harder than the kids will because of how much he loves my son. He already invited my son to the rest of the home games. She was joking but it made me wonder if we are all a little too close? The kids will be going to different colleges next year and likely won't even be in the same state. We do not expect it to last forever but thought it was important to get to know the girl our son is in love with. Now I am wondering if maybe we got too close. Are there any downsides to this or should we just keep things how they are and deal with whatever the future may hold?",

She’s an okay sleeper but not nearly as good as my oldest, a lot needier/fussier and difficult to keep her happy, but all in all still a pretty “easy” baby compared to other people I know and their experiences. I find myself thinking a lot that I’m probably done because I REALLY don’t want to do the newborn/infant stage again but then I get really sad thinking this is it. I love toddlerhood so much more than babyhood and I wonder if I will feel differently when she’s bigger but I really don’t know if I have it in me to do this all again.

We just moved from an apartment to a home with plenty of space and I’d love to start having my kiddo’s friends over a little more often. My original plan was to let my son host a Halloween party but we simply weren’t unpacked enough during October to make this happen. Now I’m curious if other parents would find a New Years Eve party appropriate. Maybe a dumb question, but since Covid, it’s been really confusing to plan group events!   The idea is that the kids would have a pizza and movie party and then watch the ball drop around midnight, drink some apple juice out of plastic champagne glasses. I’m concerned that other parents might not feel comfortable letting their kiddos stay up until midnight, but on the other hand thought it might be nice for parents to be able to drop their kiddo off and go enjoy a drink for the new year on their own. Of course any parents that would prefer to stay at the party would be welcome to do so. I’m thinking the party would begin around 8 pm and end around 12:30 am. The invite would state that kids are also welcome to spend the night. My son has never had a sleepover before so I’m not sure how many parents would realistically be comfortable with this. He has a solid group of friends in his class whose parents hang out together and I know they’d be cool with it.   So what do you guys think? Would you feel comfortable bringing your second grader to a kids NYE party? I haven’t mentioned this idea to my son yet, and could definitely plan some other kind of movie party with earlier hours sometime in the new year. Thanks for any advice!",

Our families decided to bubble. It went well aside from some annoyances that are natural to experience. However, family B daughter has a habit of pushing our daughter’s boundaries. B daughter is sneaky and can be downright mean. Our daughter, when pushed, responds by crying, which then gets negative attention from B parents. Not much disciplinary action is taken by B parents to their daughter. We teach our kids to use their words, say what they don’t like and walk away. This is employed and B daughter will eventually apologize but it seems she does this only to be able to push buttons again.   Over time we have noticed:  *Excessive criticism to their son.  *B daughter pulling our daughter into her closet and asking to show underwear.  *B son asking all the kids to show underwear.  *B son letting it slip that B dad took a belt to him, he immediately got shut down and sent away from the dinner table by B dad *B mom is very hands off and doesn’t do much with the kids.  *B dad does most of the parenting, spends most of the time with the kids.  *B dad has worked from home even outside pandemic.  *B mom is in office, pandemic had her working from home.  *B mom had a hard time with kids when working from home, most kid-tasks went to B dad.  *With vaccines, both B parents started traveling a lot.  *B family employed an at home teacher, teacher told me B daughter is very sneaky.  *B son reveals to our kids that B daughter is very mean and lies.  *B daughter steals from her mom’s purse.  *We have seen B daughter with a black eye on one occasion. She usually has dark circles.  *B daughter starts defecating outdoors and threatens to make something up about my daughter if she tells. B son tells parents, B dad yells at B son but nothing is done to the daughter. B mom ignores everything, per usual.  *B daughter tends to scratch her bottom a lot.  *Although we are trying to create space, my daughter invited B daughter and son to her recent bday party. At bday party, B daughter keeps to herself and then screams at my daughter in front of the other kids that she hates her and she doesn’t “fucking care” and “doesn’t give a shit”.  I pull B mom aside and let her know. B mom makes B dad take daughter home. No apology or acknowledgement.  *Following bday party, at school B daughter is even more mean to my daughter. Smashes a ball in my daughter’s face, attempts to punch my daughter. Other kids hold B daughter back. We try to reach out to B parents but they are dismissive. We decide to focus on educating our daughter on how to handle things and pull in the teachers and counselor.  *B daughter tells other kids not to let our daughter sit at the lunch table. Our daughter spends lunch crying in bathroom. *B son tells our son, at school, that his parents says he can’t play with him until the girls are friends again. *counselor reports that she had a heated session with the girls and alludes to the B daughter not having enough emotional growth.  *We reach out again to B parents to find a time to chat about these instances. B dad is radio silent. B mom says she “cannot curate the friendship of 9 year olds.” Which we are beyond wanting to save, we don’t want our daughter being friends with their daughter but wanted to address the issue since our families are supposed to be “friends” although we are happy to move on and away.   This is a short list.   There has been no outreach to us at all. We are still waiting on many apologies. We have been nothing but kind and patient. We have tried many times to check in but are met with dismissals. At this point B mom will randomly send us a “funny” group chat text. B dad still remains silent.   We are not looking for anything at this point. We are moving on. We have given up on receiving any apology. Our daughter has some great friends to focus on. But all this leads me to an ick question… I suspect something is (and has been) going on. Are my spidey senses correct? Do I do something about this? I shared this with my therapist and she has the same takeaway as me. I don’t want to wrongly accuse anyone but I want to protect the kids if they need it. I hope my assessment is wrong.   Would love to hear other POVs.",

My question is, I don't know what is the best morale to teach him: some of the kids who rejected him before (very badly and making fun of him) act as if nothing happened now that one kid who liked my son is back (he had moved out with his mother a year ago or so). Just so you know, those kids are older (8 to 10)  What behaviour should I encourage?  Should I promote peace and love and encourage him to forgive them and try to forget?  Should he just be confident and ignore those kids even if they speak to him now?  What he wants to do is ignore them, which I totally understand, and would do myself if I were in this situation. Everytime I see those kids my inner momma bear wants to slap them in the face but then I remember they are just kids.  &#x200B;  Thank you for your opinion!",

We weren’t properly involved, we were friends with benefits. We  were  genuinely good friends aside from the physical side of things.  We still are very good friends.  Back then, he would tell me who I couldn’t hang out with, or be friends with and I just went along with it out of respect (It sounds silly now )   I met the guy (22M) I am seeing now a year ago. We have been involved for 7 months. It was instant for us, we clicked straight away.  We have have kept our relationship completely secret until now. It felt like the right thing to do at first, but I feel like we shouldn’t have to anymore.   My son is 16 months old.   I tried to tell my son’s dad in a hypothetical way. I tried to talk about how things would be if we moved on with other people and he said “you’re not going to get with anyone else, not anytime soon anyway” and I said that it wasn’t his place to do anything if I did and he said “Do you want to find out?”  and we just left it there.

He’s not a bad guy as a whole. He has a whole other side to him. Everybody has good and bad sides.

He often will throw things or become physical in this state.  His father worked for about the first year of his life and then when my girlfriend and he split up, when he'd pick her child up, he'd often use his mother to take care of him rather than spending time with him (due to work or personal reasons). Recently, he's come back into the picture in a larger way and it's really made her child happy, but I feel that it might have also caused some of these disciplinary issues.  She's done everything for her child, given him all of the love in the world, and sometimes it doesn't feel like enough. I know that it's wearing down on her and it breaks my heart.

But I don’t have any reference because I don’t eat breakfast, and my husband eats a little and definitely thinks it’s too much too.   We don’t wanna ask for him eat less without make sure this is not healthy to him. It’s not because money or something but every 2 days I have to go to the supermarket just to buy my sons milk and cereal. I have a small child too, don’t have a car, the closest supermarket is 1 km away (0,6 miles).   Maybe change to something like bread? Or I’m being unreasonable because this is my first preteen and they eat a lot I heard? He already eats dinner more than me and my husband, eats like a monster and how I make good healthy food this make me happy, but I’m not sure about the cereal in the morning.   This kids really eat too much cereal in the morning?   Thanks for the attention, I’m sorry because English is not my first language (Brazilian living in Japan), and I tried to convert the numbers to an American measurement style, but maybe it’s not correct, I’m sorry.",

Other than a warm wet towel (paper so its clean every time) idk what else to do until i can get her into a doctor.   I also have no idea what it could be and am worried that it might be pink eye.

    "self_text": "Hi,  My 16 year old son has recently got his first girlfriend.  He spends about thirty hours a week with her.  He doesn't do much homework, doesn't do many chores, hasn't got a part-time job, ignores his younger sister now and goes in and out whenever wants.  The only thing I ask him to do is to drop and collect his sister to and from school two or three times a week, as I couldn't work otherwise.  After 5:30/6pm Monday-Friday, he has his own time.  I also ask him every few weeks to accompany his younger sister to their grandparents' house for the weekend so I can go to work on the occasional Saturday, as she doesn't like going alone.  I'm a single parent btw and their 'dad' sees them once a week for an hour, if they're lucky.  He's basically not involved in their upbringing any more.  I haven't got a boyfriend or family members to help me out and I live in a country I have no ties to.  I'm really struggling with him.  He's refusing to go to his grandparents' house, as apparently his sister's my child, not his.  I send them both together, as he needs a balanced life.  He's completely obsessed with this girlfriend.  It's important he spends time with his younger sister who used to idolise him, to have time to do homework, to see his grandparents and yes, selfishly, to give me a little respite!!!  I've told him things need to change and he said that I can't stop him.  I don't expect him to do much, just continue taking his sister to and from school two/three times a week and to go with his sister to their grandparents' house once every three weeks for a couple of days.  I don't have much control over him though and all he does is laugh at me when I try to tell him off.  I don't know what to do and I'm really struggling with no control and no support.  Am I being unfair and asking too much?  I'm in the UK, btw.  Thank you for any responses I do get in advance, btw. Xx  PS - My son hasn't got a car, btw.",

A little over two years ago he got promoted and went to nights again (he was on nights for about 2 years when he started with the company right after our 1st was born). There are systems in place for him to move back to days but they've been on hold with covid and other various plant happenings. We've been getting by emotionally for a while but he's really hit a wall of depression here recently and I just don't know how to help him through. Week days he comes home from work and helps me get the kids off to school, sleeps when we're all gone, wakes up when we all get home, eats an early dinner and leaves. He has about all told 3hrs where he sees any of us and maybe a little bit of time to himself to relax or do chores if there's not overtime in the morning. Saturday he tries to be up no later than 2pm and tries to go to bed \"early\" Saturday night to be up by noon or so on Sunday. I try to keep up on laundry and dishes so there's not so much to do on the weekends and we can spend time together but having the kids in the evenings to run various activities/errands I don't always stay on top of things (and I need personal time too sometimes).  He has had a hard time recently connecting with folks at work (even ones he knows he gets along with /has similar interests) because they are either younger and staying out partying/drinking all night is still cool or they are older/divorced and sleeping around and always talking about their date life and other things he can't relate to (this is me paraphrasing some of his recent rants). The friends we used to see all the time on days (we had a weekly d&d game running consistently for almost 3 years) still play without us and get together for events that he can't join which makes him bitter and isolate. He tried to start gaming with some other late crew and it fell apart after one session.  I just don't know how to help him. I make suggestions and he'll make excuses and I know if he just got through the mental block and did things he'd realize he can make time and space for the things he enjoys in a new way. I suggested he talk with a therapist (I went to one about a year ago when I was struggling with his nights transition) but that was a non starter for him. Anyone else on 3rd/night shifts or have SO that are that have advice/ suggestions? I'm headed to bed so I probably won see/respond to things till tomorrow but thank you in advance.",

I have an extremely hard time around the holidays because my mom passed on Christmas eve.  I don't know how I'm going to give my kids a Christmas this year and it's killing me. I know that in the scheme of things it probably a ridiculous thought to have. I've tried so hard over the years to make it a happy day but this year is different.   In the last month my husband has had his hours cut pretty  much in half. We are struggling to pay bills and buy food. I am disabled and cannot work. I feel so angry and guilty like I have let my family down. They don't deserve to struggle because of me. I have had two spine surgeries since 2018. I just found out a week ago I have a disc pushing against my spinal cord. I struggle to walk and do simple things sometimes.  My children deserve a better mom.   The other night my 17year old son heard me crying and asked If he could help. I told him no. I refuse to. He needs to be enjoying being a teenager. My failures should never become their burden. I just dont know how I'm going to explain to my 3 year old that Santa didn't forget her this year and she's been a good girl.   From emergency home repairs to my husband loosing hours. I don't know how things got so bad so fast. I know the holidays are not about gifts but family. In that aspect I truly am a wealthy woman.   I apologize for this being all over the place. I just needed to let this all out. I know things should get better in time. I just feel like crap knowing that I've let my kids down and I'm just so damn sorry.",

No regular play dates and he has not slept over anywhere or had a friend sleep over here. He is very much starting to be interested in these things and I have wanted that for him too, but with how our day to day lives are it is very difficult to arrange.   Back story: His dad and I have been separated since before he was 2. His dad is recently married and my son has 2 step siblings and a half sibling at dad’s house and they all get along. I have been in a long term relationship for 3.5 years and we live together. Dad and I have shared parenting one week on, one week off M-M. My son has always been in a school district that is not the one I live in, about 25 minutes away. So part of the issue is he does not live near kids he goes to school with, at least not at my house. His dad moved to his current school district about a year ago, but does not arrange things like this either. I live on a busy street, not in a subdivision, so there are no kids he interacts with at my house anyway. My partner and I are also business owners. We don’t have 9-5 jobs. We do have flexibility, but are often working weird hours, need to drop what we’re doing and fix an issue, etc.   I feel like I am always the one reaching out to others to set things up as is - ie in my own friend group, etc. I’ve told my son he can write my number down to give to his friends, but we haven’t received anything from that, and I don’t know that he’s actually given it to anyone.   Basically, I don’t know if I should just chill out and let things be the way they are and wait for things to happen naturally? Or push harder to reach out to other parents to set up play dates and sleepovers?",

He’s in daycare full time (that’ll be another post) and I started him in classes at our ymca to try to get him involved in activities. He is in his second class now. In both classes, the first session he rushed right out and participated for the most part. He did 7 weeks of an “intro to sports” class and after the first class it would take about 20 minutes for him to join in each week. Now we are doing gymnastics and he just sits there with a sad face during stretching and warm ups, and then walks with his head down, a sad face, hands in pockets after that. Sometimes he just stands there, and I feel awful because that’s bringing way more attention to a child who doesn’t want attention. If I let him sit with me, he giggles and acts silly and fools around, but won’t walk 10 feet away to participate in the activities which he says he wants to do and loves! I figured something non-competitive would be a better fit for his personality.   I know I shouldn’t force him but it’s very triggering for me when he refuses to participate. I was shy and didn’t participate and sometimes I wish someone would’ve worked with me to make me feel comfortable. It made me sad to not “be able to” participate. I know I’m projecting …  We can’t get a refund and I’m too stubborn to just not take him at all since we paid for it. Should I really just let him sit on the side and watch?

If I don't prompt my son, he would never clean his room on his own. Gum wrappers, water/gatorade bottles, towels, dirty clothes/socks, books, etc are always all over the floor/nightstand/shelves. His bathroom (which has PLENTY of storage space btw) always has all of his toiletries laying all over his counter, towels always on the floor, mirror and counter always full of splatter and toothpaste, etc.   Do you think I'm being too picky? Do you have a regular cadence with your child, or expectation that they don't leave their room in the morning without it being picked up?   He has been in charge of his own laundry (wash to dry to putting away) for at least 2 years, which was important to me when I had kids as my husband had never done his own laundry until he met me. Any input would be helpful!  Also--- what is considered a logical punishment that fits the crime here if he doesnt keep his space tidy? Yesterday I walked in and saw such a mess in his room and bathroom so I took away his phone for 24 hours... and my husband thinks I went too soft on him. Maybe I did... just looking for some reassurance or redirection. Thanks!",

If an activity that she's not confident with or knows she won't like comes up, she digs her heels in and won't do it. She had a meltdown on Monday because the teacher wanted her to write her name and she wouldn't - told the teaching assistant it was stupid and that she was stressed and scared then cried until she fell asleep in the book corner. Then today she was told to eat more of her lunch and told the dinner lady to shut up. That's twice, twice in one week and it's only Wednesday that she's misbehaved!!!   I had a long chat to her about how important it is that we listen, join in and do what the teachers tell us to on the way to her swimming lesson... in which she proceeded to spend most of the lesson blowing bubbles under water rather than listening to the instructor. I'm so cross with her I can barely speak.  For context I'm self employed, pregnant with twins, my husband has clinical depression and is really struggling at the moment and now I'm faced with the predicament of having my daughter becoming the notorious \"naughty child\" in her class or somehow finding a way to pull her out of school and teaching her myself to avoid the embarrassment of these \"little chats\" with her class teacher because apparently my pep talks, ironically, are not being listened to.  Before you ask, she's struggled a bit with motor skill development but has been assessed and is not dyspraxic. Her cousin is autistic, but she seems fine with sensory stimuli, doesn't stim, and although she's often cautious around other children she does talk to/play with them and seems to make friendships of a sort - so I'm fairly certain she's neurotypical and her decision to not join in as she should is an active choice to misbehave rather than a syptom of anything autism related.  Any help or advice would be much appreciated because I've basically been crying since about 5pm at this point and I literally don't know what do with her.",

    "self_text": "My boyfriend (39m) and I(37f) have been in a pretty healthy and loving relationship for the past year and a half. There have been serious discussions about us building a household and finding a place together next year. Blending families is completely new territory for me, as I separated from my son’s father three years ago and the is man is the first one that I’ve dated whom I want to take this step with.   My boyfriend is really keen on moving into a new home early next year. He and his ex have been drafting new visitation rights for his daughter (as she lives more than 6 hours away) and he wants to make the transition as smoothly as possible. At first I was on board, but now I am starting to have a bit of doubts that it just might be too soon for us to have a Spring deadline of terminating our leases (three month grace period), finding a place, and blending our families without real ground to stand on.  My concerns are of course the children. While my bf has been making a conscious effort to bond with my son, I had only just after a year of us dating decided to introduce them. During these last six months, we’ve gone on a cabin trip together and have had dinners, outings, etc… but not often enough (I have my son every other week) to really bond. In regards to my bf’s daughter, I’ve never met her. He has a complicated relationship with his ex and they have had a lot of custody/visitation issues. It is only now, after the daughter turns three that he would be able to have sleepover dates without the mother (since the child was very young and very much so bonded with the mother) every other weekend.  I feel, as a mother and a woman at unease with this. That he hasn’t bonded completely with my son yet, and that I don’t know his daughter at all. I understand that the co parenting relationship with him and his ex is on/off at times and I’ve never spoken and or met her. I’m meaning to extend that invitation so that the mother knows who I am as the daughter will be staying with us.  Are there any parents out there that have and or are experiencing something similar have any advice?",

Towards the end of that disaster, my mental health was completely destroyed. I was making poor decisions & just being a sucky parent. My boys ( currently 24M, 25M, 26M ) who were at the time 12,13,14 were suffering because my mental health was so bad I wasn't even leaving my bedroom because of my fear & self-loathing. I made the difficult & heart wrenching decision to give custody of my boys to a family friend so I could focus on getting help & fully extracating myself from my abuser (i.e. moving around a few times, going to inpatient mental health treatment, etc). I also committed a fraud crime to get money to hide from my abuser. (Don't worry, I confessed to the crime, pd the money back, & did a few months as a guest of the state).   When I was finally mentally fit again & in a safe stable environment, I started to pursue getting my boys home. It had been 2yrs by this point. We had kept in contact during this time apart as much as it was possible. However, only my 2 oldest were willing to return to me. My youngest refused. They weren't fostered thru the system, it was a power of attorney situation.  I miss seeing & talking to him. He's my baby boy & I haven't seen him for 10yrs, he won't speak to me, & my heart is breaking that I'll never see him again.",

Tried to safely open it but it mostly damaged the last page and inside back cover page.   My request:   If any of you have this book, can you type out the last pages of text??? I know... odd request. I have the page with \"when i am grumpy, with no....... everything right\"... The last two pages... I THINK say something like: > XXXX mom does so much for me, > xxxxxxx no idea xxxxxx,  Then last page...  > When xxxxx bigger, > I'll always xxxx (help her)  IF any of you could help me figure that out?  I'd like to kind of patch up the pages with a pen so we can keep enjoying the end of the book.   Why don't I buy a new book?   I almost did, but it's cute that she has a story to go with why it's messed up... she happily tells her story about how she spilled milk and it was an accident and is sad because she loves her mommy book.

How the hell does that happen? I know they get sick but I didn't realize that kids are just at risk of catching a type of flu so horrible it kills them. I can't even imagine what those parents are going through. They sent they're kid to school early in hopes to get a head start on education. They were thinking they were helping their child. Instead their child died....  I'm sitting here think \"Why am I sending her? Am I going to get her killed? This is insane!\".

Why not trust the kid? (I'd be pretty annoyed if an adult told me that I was cold when I wasn't.)  What's the worst that will happen? The kid will feel cold, and learn that a jacket keeps them warm. At the very worst, the kid will get upset by how cold they are. Great, a learning opportunity to pay attention to their bodies.   But I see this battle of wills all the time, even with kids as old as 8 or 9. Why? Can't we grant them this tiny bit of agency over their own bodies?   Edit:  I didn't think it needed to be said, but I'm talking about typical temperatures where these kinds of arguments with kids are likely, and where we're out in the playground: i.e. generally above freezing. I'm not talking about 40º below zero in the Yukon. I'm not talking about leaving them out all night in the freezing rain.  Also, yes, your kids should have warm clothes with them.

    "self_text": "My son is a sweet funny smart kid when he is at home.  He threw a small party when he was 15 and was home with his younger sisters for the night.  We found a bag of weed in his room from the party.  Since then we have caught him sneaking out 3 times and increased punishment each time to now a month, no phone and no going out with friends.  He still had his computer, Alexa, etc.  We put an alarm system in after the last attempt (2-3 weeks ago) and his windows all have sensors. Last night, a school night, I caught him sneaking out again.  He would not tell me where he was going or with who.  Since he does not have a phone I asked him how he planned anything anyway.  Not believing him that he was just going outside for a bit alone, I took his backpack from him that was with him at the time.  It had my huge bolt cutters and we got out of him that he was on his way out to climb a construction crane.  When I asked why he would leave on a school night he said it was bc the crane had security on the weekends.  I thought to myself - why do you know that?? I told him he could not be trusted in his room and that I was now going to search it top to bottom.  I believed he had a phone and possibly weed in his room.  I found his spare phone, an old old iPhone we had lost track of in the house at some point - broken screen with no value unless you are a grounded teenager.  I opened the phone on the third try to my surprise and he flipped out.  He was trying to get it back from me and we ended up getting in a physical altercation on the concrete outside - pretty ugly stuff.  We both went down without shirts on (I came straight from bed and was still in my underwear).  We went down and I put him in a headlock to control him and he starting punching and biting me. I did go through his room and found his weed stash.  I also went through his phone and found out they had climbed the crane before (200-300 feet up) with a few of his friends.  I also saw videos of them digging up a box filled with liquor bottles, of them driving over 110mph at night, smoking weed.  I no longer feel like I can control him unless I am willing to fight him on the regular. It is his twin sisters’ birthday today and they are freaking out from all the commotion last night.  He did go to school today and I plan on driving and picking him up for the time being.  He is still being very defiant and disrespectful.  The only way I can get him to do anything is to tell him I will share his phone contents with his friends’ parents if his attitude remains so bad towards his mother and myself. We are going to speak with a family therapist today.  I am contemplating reaching out to some outside help.  This is destroying our family and for the first time I am contemplating sending him off or starting a process that would result in that if nothing works.

    "self_text": "I am currently pregnant, and don’t understand the way the father of baby is acting. The father of my baby is a coworker of mine and a few months ago we both realized the feelings we had for one another. We aren’t dating but sometimes treat each other like we are. He’s always been so nice and caring to everyone. He’s sometimes Open about how he feels, is kind, handsome, caring, and knows how to treat women. We use to see each other maybe once or twice a week outside of work. It was always so fun and he made me feel safe and welcomed. We would talk for hours, stay the night with one another, he’d cook for me, joke around, watch anime. In all it was a great time, and he would always voice about how much he enjoyed the time we spend together. I found out I was pregnant around late September. I told him about 2 weeks later. He was calm but very surprised. We talked about it. We are both in our early 20s and wasn’t sure on what to do at first. I support people getting abortions but honestly didn’t want one. He told me he doesn’t think the baby is a burden and that he does love it but We both thought now might’ve not been the right time for a baby but he did say it is my choice and he will be here no matter what I choose. At first we came up with the idea of putting the baby up for adoption but after a couple of weeks of thinking it over we both agreed that we should keep it. We told our families and some of our friends and they all are very happy and excited. But he seems a bit different. He doesn’t talk to me as much as he use to. And hasn’t been wanting to hangout as much. When we do talk he seems the same as he was before. Happy,kind, and always eager to talk. But when the discussion of the baby comes up he seems quite, like he isn’t interested in talking about it. We’ve only had less than a handful of conversations about the baby with each other. Either through text or when we are alone, but for most of those conversations it seems like he’s barely there. But other times he acts caring like he use to. He would come up to me at work and ask how I am feeling or if I need anything. He would buy me things on his lunch break that I didn’t ask for. He was really excited to see the last ultrasound I had too. Honestly I’m so confused on how he could be caring one minute and then uninterested the next. I know this is probably just a lot for him since neither of us did this on purpose but it’s a lot for me too. It’s my first pregnancy and I feel like I don’t have him by my side for it even though he is here and apart of it. Part of me feels like I should just give up and let him be but I also want to talk to him about it but I don’t know how to approach him about it. I honestly just need advice from people that don’t know us, most of my friends that know about my pregnancy are also friends with him so I feel like one of them might tell him before I do or give me a bias answer if i ask them for advice.",

The off part is that, talking to my wife we both feel that the experience with the first one was terrible harder, the boy had some birth small issues, torticolis at birth, terrible face pimples, my wife couldn't breastfeed right away, he had pink crystals in the pee. Plenty of small things that stressed us out really hard. Which made us go at eachother throat constantly.  We were extremely tensed and argued a lot, even made us fear for our marriage. The boy in the middle had to live with constant arguments. Plus we were making a big deal of anything, he farted? What did it smell? Onion? We need to go to the ER (barely exagerating).

From there we have moved on to working with decimals. Please encourage your child to practice math facts nightly. As we move forward with more complex computation, it has become increasingly evident that students who do not know their facts fluently are slowed down in their work and are often inaccurate in solving more involved problems such as multi-digit multiplication and long division.”  I had some crap elementary school teachers myself and never memorized or had mental math down. I eventually was placed into the advanced Math track by 8th grade, ie once we could use calculators : ). I want to do better by my kid. Thanks wise parents!",

    "self_text": "Most people think my life is great, it's been a nightmare I can't wake up from.   My family has hid the truth from the public far to long.  I'm at my breaking point.  After several heart attacks and being in heart failure I just wanted to get my truth out there somewhere.  I have lived with a mother that very slowly fed me poison in my food, used chemicals that gave me severe  asthma or just destroyed my self confidence.  I went to college locally, I had been accepted to a few major universities but she had hidden or destroyed the acceptance letters, I found this out from her sister,  so she could keep me close.  I graduated and started working in my field.  I had worked two jobs while atte ding classes at the same time.  My chosen field was difficult to get into, political nepotism, but I had made it.  I built a small house by myself and fully paid for, a nice car.  I was happy.  Here comes mom, constant calls and showing up at my place of work, she was asked not to return by security, her calls blocked.  She cost me my jobs, 7 to be precise with her inability to control herself.  It was a nightmare.  My last job she even caused me to have an accident that took away my ability to walk and stand for a while, this injury made me disabled.  That was a long process for another story.  During this time of physical recovery my dad passed and mom spent through everything he left for her.  She lost two homes and his retirement.  Her depression was horrible and I tried to keep her stable by letting her stay with me.  Remember I owned my home outright, No mortgage, and being disabled I had no tax liability.   When mom moved in, all of my stuff vanished and in came hers.  I had been away for a week for surgery on my legs.  During that time she had used a power of attorney, because I was incapacitated, to put my home and all properties into her name.  She then proceeded to take out a mortgage in her name for my home to pay off her credit cards.  She has an at home shopping addiction.  She never returns anything she buys no matter what.  It went for about a jear without me knowing what she had done, I discovered a property tax bill in my mailbox.  I went on to discover more it's just too much for me to get out in words.  I had always meant for my house to stay free and clear, My home was my safety and sanctuary.  I confronted her and she needed to do that to get out of debt.  Her rationale was someone told her that by my being disabled, I could not have anything over a two grand value to my name.  ( NOT TRUE).  Being disabled doesn't mean you can't own the home you live in or the vehicle that takes you to the dr or get groceries.  It just means you can't own multiples of those.  During all of this discovery my health declined rapidly from stress.  It wasn't only from the stress from the home but the constant berating of how I don't care about her.  To tell the truth she was correct about that.  She had just taken away everything I had worked so hard for my whole life.  I could never pay back all the money she had borrowed against my home, my sanctuary.  This was my first heart attack.  My heart doctor  was wonderful, he got me back on my feet.  I came home and she was thrilled and treated me well for a little while.  My Dr had I was suffering from broken heart syndrome,  I could see that.  I had just been forced to leave a long term relationship  because of her drama and meddling.  That is another story in the line of drama.  He and I stayed cordial  and friends.  I was still heartbroken and defeated.  As I was saying, she was happy to have me home.  Happiness faded soon after, she started demanding I give her money.  I already payed all of the utilities and her phone and insurance on the house and buying all the groceries and household materials.  It's a lot of money on a severely limited income.  My money for the month was gone by the fifth.  My next check didn't come in til the 26th.  I didn't have it to give even if I wanted to.  It was now a daily battle.  There was nowhere I could cut back anymore.  I literally was eating ramen noodles for every meal.  I didn't travel unless necessary and eating out or clothing was an absolute luxury.  Wally world was a luxury.  Mom was going out with her sister regularly though.  I discovered a few pawn tickets and investigated while she was on one of their outings.  It was my stuff she was taking to the pawn shop.  My jewelry box was nearly empty.  I took what was left to put in a dear friend's safe and filled my box with cheap junk.  My friend purchased back all that they could locate from tickets and keeps it safe for me to this day.  She was getting turned down left and right with the fakes but didn't catch on for awhile.  Skipping forward a little bit of time to just a few months ago, I started getting weaker and bloating up.  I gained almost 75 pounds in just a few month, even though I was practically living in the bathroom.   I thought it was the stress making my stomach sick.  I decided to see my heart doctor early with my problems.  I was starting to have chest pains and difficulty breathing on top of the other.  He put me into the hospital immediately.  I was put through the ringer with heart cath and ultrasounds and scans and bloodwork..The meds they put me on for the fluid retention was brutal but it helped.  I spent a week on that medication, about 35 lbs off.  They didn't come out and say anything specific but had a kidney specialist come in with a PA from my cardiologist office.  It was going to take some time and possibly dialysis  to clean out my system he told me..  I was confused, I didn't understand what was going on.  At this time, I had been in the hospital for 10 days and no one had even reached out to see how I was or where I was.  This Dr. told me there was an abnormally high amount of arsenic in my tissues and my kidneys just wasn't able to filter it out anymore.  I was dumbfounded.  How was this even possible, my mom was how it was.  When I started denying her control over my money and letting her get her way, she was slowly killing me.  I had had another heart attack but it was very mild compared to this.  My mother was trying to murder me out of spite or to collect an insurance policy  I didn't know about.  I wasn't sure.  I still came home, it's my home regardless if when she dies I just have to leave everything I can't fit into my suv.  It will never sell, the bank can't recoup what they loaned it for now.  They let her have twice its value because of who we are.  She is not dragging me down with her.  We live in that house still 6 months later and she has been cut off from all but her pharmacy.  She stopped taking her psych meds and is spiraling out of her mind.  I can't and won't fix it for her.  She gets no outs but one she does for herself this time.  It sounds horrible how I'm treating it right now.  I'm just so terrible tired of it all.  I pray that I was dead all the time.  I'm just so tired",

Also- there’s a bidet in there.  I know it sounds crazy and harsh, but let me explain. My son (24) moved back home after college and has been 100% supported by me since. The idea was that he could save money and move out, but over a year later he’s actually in debt, none of it related to college which I paid for 100%. I’m trying to teach him to manage his money but since he resists my help I’m pulling back some of the many things I pay for. He uses an absurd amount of toilet paper. Our bathroom garbage overflows with wads of the stuff. And he never goes to the store to replace it, even if I’m willing to reimburse him. I’m sick and tired of him taking advantage of me and tired of his wasteful entitlement. I just bought a giant pack of TP and I’m thinking of hiding it and putting 1 spare roll in the bathroom every… 1 day? 2 days? It feels petty but I don’t know what else to do! Also, there’s a bidet in there so really, how much TP does he really need?",

    "self_text": "Any advice would be much appreciated.  I have a lot of things going on. So, if you are able to offer any kind of advice regarding ANY of these scenarios, please feel free to contribute. Any sort of advice helps!   My husband and I have never really had the best marriage. I’ve really tried my best but a long time ago, he had an affair at the beginning of our marriage, and I feel that it’s always been a struggle since then. While we went to many years of marriage counseling, it just was always a bad memory that I held on to in my mind. Other than that, he is a great husband by doing things for me and he is an amazing father to our young children. He just shows no emotional attachment to me and is literally always in a bad mood.   We bought a house in a place I ended up hating. We sold the house and made nothing on it. We had no money whatsoever and so we had to move in with his parents. I assumed this would be a temporary thing but it has ended up being longer than I had expected. Husband won’t move out. He said that we need to stay with his parents for a minimum of 12-18 months to save some money. I get that we have no money. But I never would have sold our house if I knew we would have to live with them for this long. I have a terrible relationship with my own parents (mother specifically) and I haven’t spoken to them in months. I have not spoken to any of my family members (siblings included) as they are the most non-supportive, critical people I have ever met. I have so much going on in my life and I just couldn’t handle the stress of defending myself to them anymore. So I took a very long, much needed break from them all.   That being said, I have never had a good relationship with my mother-in-law either since the day I had met her. She never liked me. No matter what I did, it was never acknowledged or appreciated and I was told numerous times that I should stop trying to have a relationship with her. The situation with her is different than it is with my own mother - don’t get it twisted. My mother is in a category of her own and I have legitimate reasons for cutting her off. However, I have tried so hard to have the relationship I have yearned for with my own mother, with my MIL, and she clearly wants nothing to do with me. It’s been extremely awkward and uncomfortable living in a small house with these dynamics. My husband doesn’t care about my feelings on it because he said we have no other place to live and our kids need a roof over their heads. Got it. I know all of this. I don’t want to sound ungrateful and unappreciative for their help because I can’t thank them enough. I don’t have the support from my OWN family, so I am truly appreciative for the help I am receiving. I just don’t understand why my MIL feels the way she does towards me. I try to have conversations with her, I always include her in our outings, even paying for tickets to attend events so she feels included. It’s very uncomfortable for me being in the same room with her, with me trying to always start up conversations and getting one word answers on return. I have no choice but to stay here because I have no place to live. I have no money.   I guess I am just feeling very overwhelmed and I am venting on this subject because I don’t have my own mother to rely on and knowing how my MIL feels about me, just makes me feel even worse.i find it bothering me a lot when I see her on the phone with her daughter, as well as other family members, laughing and having nonchalant conversations with them. I find myself feeling jealous of their relationships, because I know that she will never want to have that with me. Especially jealous of the relationship she has with her daughter who lives literally thousands of miles away and she never sees. But I am there all of the time and I can’t even get a conversation. It will always be awkward and uncomfortable for me, and that horrible feeling you get inside.   What does my husband say about this? He says to stop trying to force a relationship with her because he has told me numerous times that she doesn’t want that with me. He tells me to “get over it” especially now, because we have no place to live. I get what he’s saying, but it doesn’t make the bothersome feelings I have within me, go away.   Do you have any suggestions on how to deal with ANY of these current scenarios?  Thank you for helping me!",

    "self_text": "So I saw a TikTok (not sure if I can post it since I looked over the rules and it said no pictures of children, even though this isn’t my child it is still a child so I’m assuming no?) and it was a father laying in bed with his daughter playing a song. The mom walks in and says the daughter obviously doesn’t like the song, he says of course she does, asks the child and the child shakes her head so he gets up and says basically “y’all don’t know good music”. The video was basically meant in good humor, the song was a rap song (by Young Boy) so obviously a child wouldn’t usually be into that type of music.   My issue is with the comments, they pointed out how the dad was shirtless and in a dark room when the mom walked in (I’m sure this was scripted by the way) and he could have been up to something sinister.   It just boils my blood. I never gave it much thought but why can’t a father have a normal relationship with his daughter without it being something evil? My own mother used to hate wearing pants, no one ever claimed she did anything to us! I guess I just wanted people’s views on this, given I am about to have a daughter and have a husband who is excited to do everything with her. I couldn’t imagine people saying he was up to something with her!  Edit: if I’m told it’s acceptable I’ll post the TikTok here!",

    "self_text": "I dont mean absentee fathers, I just mean dads that are around but generally uninvolved/uninterested in parenting. For context my wife and I are in our mid 20s and last year had our first child. It was an emergency c-section, resultong in an extended hospital stay. so wife couldn't move much for the first six weeks. On top of that she really struggled with breast feeding (undiagnosed tongue tie despite asking two doctors and a nurse to check) so we ended up bottle feeding. On top of that the baby fought sleep since the day she was born (rocking and patting for HOURS) and would only sleep on one of us.  I stayed home for a week changing diapers and getting the baby in the night etc. but eventually had to go back to work. Even after I went back, I would often offer to make or pick some dinner and take the baby for a few hours so my wife could at least take a nap. But when went back to work I was shocked by the responses of my coworkers.  I worked a construction job amd was the young guy the rest of them being around 40. I figured since they all had multiple kids they would be somewhat sympathetic but that couldn't be further from the truth. A week and a half after returning my boss told me that by the end of the week I no longer had an excuse to be tired. Another coworker told me I shouldn't be getting up at night at all since I didn't have breasts. Don't get me wrong my wife did everything she could to let me sleep but she did just have a major surgery and a baby who refused to sleep. Another guy told me he never changed a single diaper. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. There were plenty of other comments like that too like \"you're a good mother\" and \"if your doing her job what does she do?\" And \"you look tired get some sleep would you\" and \"you need to quit dragging your ass\".  You get the point.  I know they're wives didn't like having babies but I can't blame them if they had no support! But these guys kept having more kids because they wanted a big family but did nothing to help and they harass me for trying to help my wife. Babies are difficult. My friends who have become parents have also been really hands on, far more than I expected from them. I could be way off base here but I really dont think im in the wrong on this. Im honestly just shocked Why do some dads think it's OK to want/have a big family but be so uninvolved in childcare?",

We were prepared for that, but it has spiraled massively since then. She came home on Sunday with roses and a ton of things he bought her. Then went to her room for the night. After that point, every single bit of communication with us was just angry. My husband went to talk to her in person, and she pushed him away hard. He just asked how she is feeling, because she is acting completely different. She refused to acknowledge it.  By 11am Tuesday, she decided she didn't want to live with us anymore, since, in her words, we don't love and care for her at all. We aren't taking care of her feelings. She packed her bags and went to another family. That family says they are in her corner and there to support her, but we have always had issues with them trying to get her back and subtly implying that we are bad parents. She lived with them for nine months before coming to me, and the reason she left was that they expressed they were not willing to adopt her and commit to 5 years.   It is a whole mess of a situation and my husband and I are powerless. Today, the therapist office moved her therapy appointment time back an hour, and now she is refusing to go. It's another 3 weeks until I can get her in again. The other family isn't trying to talk her into going, because they say she is doing just fine with them. I just want to scream into the void. I feel like they're stealing my daughter.  In her mind, I think, they would have kept her from getting into an abusive relationship. They have more rules and are more controlling. But they also basically buy her everything she wants. They keep saying they're just her support while we work through things, but they aren't working with us to make sure she's facing and addressing this. I'm afraid if she still refuses, they're not going to push her to try and reconcile.   Should I have taken her phone and forced no contact with her boyfriend? Definitely, at this point. But I had done that exact same thing with a different emotionally abusive relationship before, and it took us a full year to recover, and it still never returned to the way it was. It was a year of ER trips, anger, screaming, school refusal, doctors, therapists, psychiatrists, just everything. I was hesitant to go through it all again.   At least I'm getting a mental health break too. I meet with my therapist tomorrow. This would be a lot easier if she was an adult, not 16.

She also has disruptive mood disregulation disorder, she has to be evaluated by a neuropsychologist and is suspected to have conduct disorder (for those who don't know, it's basically the Beginning of antisocial disorder which is different than being asocial). She has therapy twice a month, she sees a behavioral coach weekly, she's on mood stabilizers, she gets med checks monthly. She does an after school program by her own choice and she loves it.  I encourage her to do what she's focused on, if it's art, exercise, writing, you name it. I reward good behavior, discourage bad. I try to involve her in things, let her choose what she wants to do, help make decisions for dinner, and so on.  She's in 2nd grade, she can tell you what healthy coping skills are. She knows what's good and what's bad. What she should do and what she doesn't do. She gets praised by her teachers, speech therapist, everyone. But at home she's nothing like they say. \"Can you please pick up your papers?\" And she screams.  \"Please leave your brother alone, he doesn't want to play\" more screaming. It doesn't matter what it is I say, if she doesn't want to do it she screams and cries. She yells as loud as she can about how she will never love me, she hates me, she wants me gone. She wants a new mom. And you can only imagine how bad it gets when she's in trouble. Just today I walked into the room to see her standing over the toddler, smacking him because he wasn't doing but she wanted him to. And this isn't the first time it's happened. I was out of the room for literally 20 seconds. So I had to make the role that she is no longer allowed to be alone with her brothers. If I have to be sitting and nursing the baby she has to be in her room. The toddler is not allowed in her room. I reminded her about right before feeding the baby and while I was in the middle of pumping she had decided that she was going to lock her little brother in her room with her and scream at him for doing what she told him to. I have had to ban play fighting in my house because my toddler doesn't know his own strength and every day I have to remind her no play fighting no pretend hitting nothing of the sort because she encourages my toddler to beat her up to the point of tears. I've caught her telling him \"hit me hit me come on hit me\" and while I do curb his bad behavior as well he doesn't understand why it is bad yet. I keep telling her he doesn't understand that hitting is bad he does not understand how strong he is because this toddler is like a tiny bodybuilder. But she doesn't listen. Every single rule in the house she ignores because it's an inconvenience to her and she doesn't care. And that was her response to my question of why she doesn't listen to the rules.  I tried to spend one-on-one time with her I tried to do things with her but she wants nothing to do with me. I am at a loss and I don't know what to do anymore with her. I feel like an absolutely terrible mother because I'm doing everything in my power to try to raise her to be a decent human being only for her to constantly scream and cry to hit a toddler to bully her brothers for her to tell me what a horrible person I am because I have to enforce her rules I have to be the bearer of bad news I have to be the one that tells her she can't have candy for breakfast. She's so well behaved for everybody else the school has zero complaints about her but at home she's not the angel everybody thinks she is and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm told she's just masking out in public and she's being her true self at home and if that's true I really feel like I'm doing a terrible job because I don't know what to do anymore",

He assured us that it was just a feeling, what we would call \"ideation\", rather than \"tendency\". Still doesn't make it any less terrifying.  We didnt freak out, outwardly, bc we don't want him to feel like it's not safe to talk to us but I couldn't hold in the tears. After we all spoke I just held him and told him that I couldn't imagine life without him, we were both crying. He has a therapist that he sees once a week (today, actually) and also sees the guidance counselor at school if he needs to. He has had a hard time adjusting to middle school, and had some bad experiences so far (there was some hazing in the beginning of the year, he's had balls thrown at him in gym, and someone violated his privacy in the bathroom one time) and we have been diligent in talking to the school authorities about all of it. The kid from the bathroom was caught and that was taken care of, everything else... I mean, it's middle school. These are the things that build scar tissue. Everyone goes through it.  Before his first class he hangs out with the assistant principal for about 5-10 min just to get in the right mindset. We've talked about trying a different school, but middle school is middle school. It's the hardest time no matter what school you're in. At least that's my opinion, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. We got him to go in, Ill be picking him up right after, and then at 5:30 he has his appointment.   So this morning my husband went in to work super late, bc he was not about to just walk out after hearing that, and my youngest didn't get to school until 9ish bc I drive them both. School starts at 8. That's not the problem though, I'm just saying.   THEN, when we get to my youngest's school at 9,  he  starts crying bc he doesn't want to be away from me. I sat in the backseat in front of the school holding him while he sobbed and hugged me. He said he was going to miss me too much. This went on until 9:30. I had to call the school guidance counselor to come out and help me get him in the building.   My heart is so heavy and I feel lost. We shower our children with love, bc our childhoods were awful. My husband and I promised each other that we would give them the exact opposite childhood that we had. Unconditional love, togetherness, fun, unbreakable bonds, and so far weve done our best to achieve that. And still, they're struggling so much. I'm at a loss. This is not my main account bc I'm scared of the responses I'm going to get, and still I'm willing to wade through the judgmental yuckiness in case someone out there has any solid advice that maybe I haven't thought of.   Just as an aside, I realize that everyone needs a mental health day once in a while and sometimes we allow that. They both get good grades, theres no reason to believe that a day here or there will be deteimental to their education (which is laughable as it is). However, they were both sick for like 10 days with this sore throat/stomach/cough bug and already missed too much school. I can't keep them home this time bc it only perpetuates the difficulty in going back into school. I felt that my youngest needed to go in so he could see that he will survive without me. Even if it's a hard day.   So yeah, give me anything you've got. I'm willing to listen and learn.",

    "self_text": "It's our sons 3rd birthday next month. We have never had a get together celebration for his birthday because of covid so this year I wanted to do something special for him.  He is peppa obsessed and I found a peppa bouncy castle with slide he would love, and 2 venues that could take us  We don't know that many kids that would attend especially with the time of year his birthday is but but my thinking is even if one or 2 show up our son will have a ball and would adore a peppa bouncy castle even if it is just him on it 😄!  My partner doesn't want me to organise this, first the issue was money then I said don't worry I'll pay for it all. Now she is saying her mental health is so poor she is overwhelmed at the idea of organising it.   I said don't worry ill organise everything. She then said that I am making our sons birthday about what I want and not what our son wants, he doesn't know any better he will only be 3. I said if he could talk and choose I really think he would choose this! He is peppa mad and adores bouncy castles!  . She is still insisting we do something just the 4 of us (including our youngest daughter) and not the party idea because of her poor mental health and doesn't want to be around anyone else  I said we could do something as a family one day and I could throw the birthday party a separate day and she doesn't even have to be there. She said that if I organised it of course she would want involved   She has nothing planned or booked but is really against this idea of any form of get together  I feel a but annoyed and feel she is being selfish - am I the one being selfish?

    "self_text": "Hello Reddit!  Last years I share on Facebook something we do in my house in the Christmas about the Santa and some people find interesting and I wanna share with you guys, maybe can be interesting for anyone.  We have a 10yo and a 3yo boys and we always feed the imagination about Santa in our home, but we came of a poor country (Brasil) and I used to buy a lot of presents to give to many children who live on the streets (with food, I used to wrap the presents and give to the mom or dad, or the guardian on the street, to decide how or when give to the child). But my son starts to ask why Santa don’t give presents to these kids? Why he is so mean to them? (In that time he was 4yo)  Yes… Difficult to save the magic.  I explain to him “Santa Claus is the mailman of the Christmas. There is so much kids in the world, the post office can’t attend everyone, so the parents buy presents online and Santa make sure of all those kids will get one in time. It’s a lot of job, but he can do it. But some parents cannot afford presents and it’s not their fault.” This make a lot of easier to explain how he cannot get a dinosaur or airplane on the Christmas too, because, mom and dad can’t buy these things, as well.   Now we live in Japan, where don’t have kids on the streets, but we keep telling the same story for the younger.   Maybe is stupid but, I can’t keeping telling to them “bad kids don’t get a present”, because capitalism says the opposite to us. I don’t like the idea of only families can afford stuffs have good kids.   Well, that’s it. Thank you guys for the attention.",

    "title": "Guide on how to survive as a single 19 year old father (COVID edition!)",
    "self_text": "This is actually just a rant phrased in my own creative, sarcastic way. But on the weird off chance that someone can learn something from this, glad I could help.  This guide is for those who: Have no family, have no partner, have no money, have no education, and live in one of the most expensive cities in the USA   Step 1:  Understand that having a child despite the situation listed above is probably the worst decision you could make. Do not get someone pregnant. Especially not an ex during a one night stand who will dump the baby on you and disappear into the night out of spite  If you fail step 1, continue with this guide   Step 2:  Work during the pregnancy. You have nine months to save. You may not have family but the mother does. Move in with her and her family and just work. The schedule that works best is: 16 hour shift, 2 hours to unwind at home with hobbies, 5 hours of sleep, 1 hour in the morning to shower and get ready for work. Most jobs won't let you work 7 doubles so take on a 2nd part time job and work doubles on the days your 1st job is forcing you to take off. DO NOT TAKE DRUGS. DRUGS ARE EXPENSIVE. DRUGS WILL MAKE YOU CRASH. LET YOUR BRAIN DEVELOP A SCHEDULE AND LET IT AUTOPILOT. It's ok if you lose track of time, if don't remember the last 2 weeks, whatever. Just don't stop.   Step 3:  Baby is here! All that money saved can buy you supplies and equipment! What's that? The mother has dissapeared into the night and her parents have no reason to let you stay in their house if their daughter is no longer there? Welp time to make use of Reddit! Redditors are usually safer than Craigslist. Post on your cities subreddit explaining your situation and ask for a place to stay. Keep your rent budget between 300-500 per month and hope to God someone is kind enough to accept. If not, put baby into government care.  If someone is letting you stay in their basement for cheap, continue with the guide   Step 4:  Make use of your time at home. Newborns need a lot of attention! Use all that money you saved up to spend time with the little one for the next couple months. During that time, it's time to get an education. Getting a GED online is super quick and easy, so make sure to complete that ASAP. As soon as you have that, apply for a tech bootcamp. Cybersecurity is usually a good one to go for. Ivy league schools like California Institute of Technology even offer 3 month bootcamps for cheap! You're now 14k in debt but they look GREAT on resumes!   Step 5:  The baby is 3 months old now, and you're running out of savings. That's bad. The good news? You're now \"technically\" a college graduate. More good news? The government provides Headstart for your child for free since you're such low income! Put that lil  cutie into the nearest program and that grants you 6 hours of free time Monday-Friday. Time to look for a remote job.   Step 6:  Coming to terms with the fact your certificate is worthless and you've essentially been scammed. No one will hire you with only a bootcamp education. You've wasted $14,000, and a bachelors from WGU would have been worth more AND cheaper. The silver lining? Sales positions.   Step 7:  Abandon all morals. It's survival of the fittest. You and your child is all that matters. No matter whose life you ruin, no matter how many people hate you, it's time to sell insurance. As a college graduate, you qualify to work for a high end insurance agency. These are just legal scam centers. You will be informing people on the regular, that they do not qualify for maximum reimbursement due to whatever bullshit lies your manager wants you to make up. Everyone will hate you. But oh god, the commission pay. The more you screw people over, the more money you make. COMMISSION PAY DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK. SOME MONTHS WILL BE BELOW MINIMUM WAGE. DURING THOSE MONTHS, ONLY EAT BREAKFAST. SAVE ALL MONEY FOR THE BABY, THEY ARE EXPENSIVE. NOTHING SHOULD EVER CHANGE FOR HER. 3 MEALS A DAY, SCHOOL, BUBBLE BATH, NICE CLOTHES, DIAPERS. SHE SHOULD FEEL NO CHANGE EVEN IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING. KEEP THE LIL ONE HAPPY   Step 8:  Use your sales experience to move into a legit sales position. Digital marking consultant is an entry level position you can get just using your certificate & year of sales experience. Become an account manager and work with businesses on their ad campaigns. Use the scummy tactics you learned in insurance to maximize profits for businesses. Stretch the truth, find loopholes. The more money they make, the more money you make. And best part? You aren't ruining anyones life this time. Just making people buy products that don't quite work the way they thought it would. An easy recovery, a learning experience if anything.    Step 9:  Climb the corporate ladder. Commission pay only works if you're working hard. Some months are a struggle, others are great. You have a child, you want consistently. Climb to a manager position, get a salary.    Step 10:  Rent your own place and move out of the redditors basement you've been living in  Sarcastic guide is over. I'm moving into a house this Monday. My daughter is turning 3 next month and she's both happy and healthy. I didn't talk much about the actual child raising part in my rant but she has never been without necessities. I have never let her schedule change. I think she's picked up on my stress growing up because she's got some very clingy tendencies. I've probably caused her to need therapy later down the line just from our situation. But we're alive. I'm making a comfortable living wage, starting from literal zero 3 years ago. I've had some weird run ins with her mom, her moms family, and my family all trying to take her from me. This has been 3 years of fighting, struggling, and luck to get here. I wish this lifestyle on no one. I can only hope I've made the right decisions to keep my child happy and healthy.",

    "title": "Teenage son confided in me that he has confidence issues. How do I best support him?",
    "self_text": "Throwaway because he knows my username.   I would love some advice from parents who may have gone through something similar. My son is 15 and an only child, so I don’t have the experience to draw wisdom from. It’s particularly challenging for me because this kid seemingly “has everything”: he’s incredibly smart (straight A’s his whole life), is athletic, tall and handsome - such a weird thing to include but he gets compliments often on his looks, so he doesn’t just hear it from me and his dad though we try not to focus on those and more on being compassionate, curious, etc. - kind, warm, hilarious, has interesting hobbies, even has a lovely gf, and from what I hear from his friends he’s pretty well-liked in school, too. I made the mistake of pointing out his strengths to try to shift his focus on things to be grateful for but in retrospect I realized that it was extremely dismissive of his emotions, so I apologized and tried to reassure him that I’ll try my best to be supportive and make him feel seen and heard when he expresses his doubts.   On the surface you wouldn’t guess that he has confidence issues at all. He’s pretty assertive in public, has no trouble speaking to strangers if needed, voices his opinions, preferences, and needs when warranted and politely at that, and at school we always get feedback and notes from his teachers about his participation and leadership, etc. so I’m a bit lost.   Is this natural for his age and is this something he should grow out of? What should I do so that he feels supported as he navigates this tricky phase?  If it’s out of my hands to help him see all that he is, how do I at least ensure that he doesn’t convince himself that he is what he isn’t? I admit that I have difficulty communicating with him sometimes though we get along really well, which probably adds to his concerns. I am a Feeler type mom who thinks it’s important to discuss and celebration emotions and can express how I feel easily so I am big on being emotionally available, whereas he hesitates and struggles a bit with expressing himself or at least his emotions on a deeper level. I don’t force this but I do encourage it. I wonder if it can feel suffocating for him for me to check on his emotional state while he’s trying to sort who he is and his place in this world… If so, how do make sure he knows I am there for such needs without being overbearing?   If it means anything, dad is present and they both adore each other. They have similar dispositions and dad isn’t the type to initiate heartfelt deep conversations, so that’s where I step in but our home is typically full of affection - hugs, verbal I love yous, and laughter between the three of us. We enjoy each other’s company but are also big on giving each other space. It’s not always perfect but is full of love, I think. Just wanted to paint what it’s like at home if it means anything.   Thank you so much for your time and help. I am raising a particularly wonderful kid and it hurt me to hear that he’s suffering from low self-esteem. I hate the idea that he doesn’t see himself the way we and the rest of the world sees him, and that it’s causing him pain. I can only imagine how confusing it must be for him too, to feel that way when you aren’t lacking in “proof” that says otherwise.   Yesterday I told him while driving that I’m sorry for overlooking how much it must take for him to be such a great kid. I know it’s innate and naturally who he is as well, but it’s so easy to forget that it’s still a choice for him and many other good kids to maintain and balance a lot of things - being a good child, a good friend, a good student, etc. He said it meant a lot to hear me say that, and I feel ashamed that it took me a while to realize that.   I just want to be the parent he needs and deserves.   Thanks again for everything.",

At first, she would do it occasionally and it was no big deal but for the last couple of weeks she’s started doing a lot more frequently, like 4-5 times per day. I know this type of role-playing isn’t always concerning at her age but I’m starting to worry that it’s not so much “play” anymore and becoming regressive. Her mother and I shower her with positive attention, have been very supportive and of course want her to express herself. However, the behavior is a bit obnoxious and it’s getting difficult to remain patient during these times because there doesn’t seem to be a solid pattern of when this happens. It’s anytime, whether we are home or out doesn’t seem to matter. She will just cease speaking, moving, etc. as her 4 year old self and go full on baby mode.

The kids know the presents are in a closet and to stay away, but as an extra \"safety measure\" I've also wrapped them; it's easier to tell if they've tampered with wrapping paper than peeked inside a box.  Since the presents are wrapped I was going to put them under the tree in the living room, but my mom said that was mean and just tempting them to mess with them since they'll see them constantly. I see what she's saying but they also know they're in the closet so it's not like they couldn't find them anyway.   So, parents, when do you/would you put presents under the tree?  Edit: for additional info, my kids are 8, 5, and 2. We host my husband's family Christmas on the 24th at our house, and go to my sister's to open presents Christmas Day. They get two small gifts from us on Christmas Eve (one is a variation of the same thing every year), so other than those two gifts, the rest of the presents under the tree are for my husband's family; I keep the presents separated by which family's Christmas we'll be opening them.

    "self_text": "My boy is the last one out of our kids that I thought would've had issues with friends, but it continues to be a struggle.  4th grade was a COVID year and this is when he started to struggle, he wasn't in class with the boys from the prior year and the classes were pretty silo'd.  People also weren't doing as much outside of school so his opportunities were limited.  As a result, he did feel like he didn't have any friends that year.  We were happy in 5th grade because he started to become close with several boys and seemed to have a nice little crew.  Towards the end of last year and into this year, we have just seen intermittent problems with a couple of them.  They seem to dangle their friendship over his head as something they could take away if he doesn't act a certain way.  My wife and I found the entire thing really strange...everything from telling him not to be friends with certain kids or getting mad with him for stupid things.  We also aren't a big fan of how the parents just let these kids roam around. If our son hangs with them, we just don't know where they will end up.  We started to encourage him to start to hang out more with a couple different groups of kids in his school that he's known for awhile and is casually friends with.  These kids are nicer and he has more in common with them.  I think he is afraid because 1) The 2 \"leaders\" will get mad about it  2) His current group is considered more popular  3) He might feel like he has no friends during the in-between period.  Right now it's comfortable for him, he has a group to go to.  I do think that he will ultimately be better off without this group.  He doesn't have much in common with them and honestly he doesn't really hang out with them much outside of school.  He basically is friends with the 2 leaders and they have this attitude with him like \"We are the reason you are part of the larger group, so don't do anything we don't like or we'll kick you out\".  He'll either need to start standing up for himself or just realize the kids are a-holes and find a different group of friends.  I think I just hate the fact that he is having a hard time standing up for himself and trying to keep this friendship going with people that neither my wife or I really like that much.  He started to become friends with 1 other kid, but got so much grief from the 2 leaders that I think he backed off.  Honestly just not sure how to help him work through this.",

    "self_text": "I've got a 6 year old who lives with me full time, and a 4 year old who mostly lives with her dad. The 6 year old has been diagnosed with ADHD, and the 4 year old.... Probably will be.  Anyways, when the 4 year old stays the night, they are understandably super excited, and a little bit overstimulated (probably a lot). This of course, presents in problems listening, acting correctly (I'm not strict, don't hurt each other, don't be running around, after a certain time you need to stay inside, don't run around after a certain time-cause we need to get settled for bed, etc). Anyways, I obviously am at my wits end figuring out how to help them simmer down, and get to sleep before, you know, 10 pm or something. Preferably with minimal screaming. Maybe them putting pull ups on themselves, or stop kicking me when I do it. These bedtime behaviors happen when the 4 year old is here, and the night after. However, the night after, the 6 year old will typically settle down once she's actually in bed. I've got a good handle on how to get her to stay in bed and go to sleep  when it's just her .  I understand that there's the excitement, and overstimulation. I don't blame them, but I'd really like for bedtime and sleep schedules to not get disrupted. Bedtime is at 8. We don't have extra rooms for them to sleep separately, and when I HAVE tried having 1 go to bed before the other, or something, but they just... Refuse to be separated. Im a single mom, and while we live with my mom, they aren't my mom's responsibility, so I feel like I don't have enough hands. I'd love to like, hire someone to help me with JUST bedtime, but that's also not an option.  I guess what I'm asking is how can i head off the overstimulation, and excessive excitement, and better suit their needs when both are here?",

He was grounded and threatened to tell everyone I was lying so he could go back to ex’s house.  Well, he got upset over something stupid and took off. Used his friends phone to call my ex who has visitation as it hasn’t processed through the court yet to remove it, though he hasn’t been there in months. She drove half an hour and picked him up without calling me to let me know what was happening. Is now withholding him.   My biological son, she is just ex step mom and has several CPS cases for abuse and neglect.   She had him write out all kinds of lies and rewarded him with unlimited screen time, games he knows he can’t play and whatever else he wanted. He told her I’ve been abusing him.

    "self_text": "TL;DR Son with autism and other issues, after a decade of his dad being useless and toxic, I filed for divorce and moved our son away. No child support. I am stressed and feel like a failure because I keep losing my temper with my boy.  I have 3 children, two adult kids that have moved out, and a 10 year old son.   My son has Autism and ADHD, as well as major sensory issues which have resulted in his aggressive behaviors and delayed education. He cannot attend school because when he is overwhelmed, he will hit, kick, and scream.  So I homeschool him. I have been his full time caregiver and a stay at home mom.  My husband (his father) has been useless. No exaggeration here. Everyone sees it, it's not just me. We lived together for over 10 years... And the man would only spend approximately 5 hours a week with our son, on average.  He knows what our son's triggers are, but not only would he not care, often he would purposely continue triggering our son when he was having a meltdown. Telling him that it's the right thing to do, to teach him to cope. Then, he'd go into his home office and leave me to deal with calming my little one down.  His father would flat out refuse to do basic things for our son: not make him lunch, not help him in the bathroom, not bathe him, not attend our son's birthday parties or holiday parties.  Plus, even when my husband was out of work for months at a time, he would not clean, cook, or do any chores. Nor would he watch our son so I could get a job. BTW, I have physical disabilities, I used all the energy I had on caring for our son and tried to maintain the house and cook. My husband didn't care.  So I inherited a large sum of money earlier this year. My husband and I agreed that we would use it to buy a house and a second car. At the same time, he was looking for a job... There is a high demand for his skills... Weeks of not looking, turned into several months. Living off my inheritance.  I had enough. So I gave him a 2 month deadline to get a job and start spending real time with our son. That 2 months came and went.  Over the next month, I filed for divorce, bought a house, and moved out of state, near my family.  Now, I am basically broke. My soon to be ex husband still doesn't have a job. So no child support or insurance for our son in the near future. He is dragging his feet on signing the papers, because he thinks that will delay child support...   My son misses his father, terribly. I have him do video calls with his dad twice a week. It's been a month in the new place, my kiddo loves the house, he loves being near family, and in certain ways he is thriving and healing from the toxicity he was exposed to (my husband started arguments all of the time and wouldn't stop even though it was in front of our son).  But my son is acting out, some of his behavior issues have been exacerbated by the move. I feel like I'm failing him. Not because I am divorcing his dad, but I am so busy with getting us situated and doing necessary repairs on this old house... I feel like I am not tending to his needs enough. Nor able to keep my stress levels hidden from him.  I am fucking tired. I have found myself yelling at my son on several occasions, and I feel like the worst mother.   I need a break, but no one in my family can handle caring for my son's needs nor his behavior issues. So I am stuck. Broke, but with a fully paid off house, and no child support or insurance for our son to get him into a GOOD therapy program.  I just needed to vent. Thank you for reading my novella.",

I ran out and saw her sit up on the step about halfway down, maybe step 5, and then in horror I saw her tumble backwards as I screamed and ran after her. Of course I couldn’t make it fast enough. I thought about throwing my body down the stairs to beat her and break her fall, but the odds of that being successful were near 0. So I watched her little face roll and tumble down 6 more steps, fearing so much that she would be gone at the bottom. It was horrific.   My heart is so heavy. So much guilt. I was extremely lucky that she was fine, but what if she wasn’t?? These are the thoughts I can’t shake. And the image of her rolling and I can’t help her. What if she broke her neck? What if I would’ve lost her?   Later in the day, we were playing, and she fell on her face in the kitchen while she was crawling. She busted her top lip a tiny bit since she’s got lots of teeth now. Interesting that this left more of a mark and seemed to hurt her more than rolling down 6-7 wooden stairs.   I guess this worrying constantly is the norm for the rest of my life.

I’ve also seen many posts recently about women saying they never want to be pregnant/deliver again, and that freaks me out bc it makes me feel like I missed something - like I overlooked or am forgetting the awfulness of my own delivery or something.   I did not have an easy delivery by any means- I pushed for over 4 hours,I was pressured to have a c section but didn’t do it- I pushed to the point of absolute exhaustion and he flipped and came out at the very last moment (they were going to do a c section once I lost consciousness). I had a full epidural and once I started pushing couldn’t really feel the pain (but I did feel it when I wasn’t pushing). It was very very hard for me.   Once my son was born the literal first thing I said to my husband was “I want another.”   I guess im worried about doing it again, worried that my feelings of “I can do it again” are based on a foggy memory from when I was filled with hormones and fentanyl (epidural).   Did anyone else struggle with this? How was your second pregnancy/ delivery, and would you do it again?",

I have a 1 year old as well and no car in the Canadian winter (husband needs it to get to work). We walk to school, 10 minute walk.   I just don't see what I can do. He just keeps repeating he doesn't want to go. Not like I can drag him there with a 1 year old. I need to do things during the day, I need to get back to work. But we can't afford daycare for 2. So he needs to go to school.  Anyone have any suggestions?  Update: After more food, and we both took some time to calm down. I talked more about it with them, said that I know we don't like school right now. But you have fun usually. Everyone has good and bad days. I wish I could go to school. Tell me all about it when you get home. After a bit more encouragement, we got dressed and walked to school.   Thank you for your tips. I'll have more ideas for the future, just glad we got there today.",

    "self_text": "Our son has an established beddtime routine but the last month is a nightmare for all of us. He sometimes skips afternoon naps but is visibly tired (coordination issues, bags under the eyes, grumpy). When he falls asleep in the afternoon, it’s almost impossible to wake him up. If I let him, he could sleep even 5 hours. So I wake him up after 1 hour because nighttime sleeping is otherwise impossible.  No matter how long he sleeps in the afternoon, we can’t put him to sleep. He is non verbal, probably on the spectrum with developmental dysphasia. I am desperate because if I stay with him, he wants to play. He points at things and wants me to put them in his bed so he can throw them at me. If I refuse, he screams. If I try to hold hands, he bites me. Simply put - if I’m present, he wants to play. I tried talking quietly, singing lullabys or playing the guitar  (that makes him angry).  If I leave, he screams. I feel so so SO bad but the only thing that seems to help is just leave and let him scream until he falls asleep. I feel extremely bad and I’m on the edge of a mental breakdown but I have no idea what else to do. I’m constantly googlimg, asking other parents but I only hear:   don’t let him sleep in the afternoon  put him to sleep later in the evening  co-sleep   The only option for us is 1 but still, even if he falls asleep quickly, he still wakes up at night frequently. I am super tired, especially when he falls asleep around midnight. For me, to get enought rest (when he wakes me up 3 times at night) I have to go to sleep around 10 pm. Still I get only about 30 mins of deep sleep every night. Because he wakes up, no matter what, around 6 am. I am desperate and have no idea how other people do it and how on earth 7 hours of sleep is enough for such a small kid. Not to mention he is very loud even trough the day and I have very sensitive ears so it’s a torture for me to be with him. I use professional noise cancelling pluga for concerts, they help a lot. I am depressed, tired, desperate, scared and angry. I think I fail.",

She’s kind, good looking and athletic.  She’s lost most of her friends and is letting the world pass her by.  She’s become extremely reclusive.  It’s heart wrenching to watch.  She won’t hardly speak to me anymore so I can’t really have open conversations.  My parents think this has been a stroke of bad luck and think that with time it will sort itself out.  My parents who are normally quite intelligent, I think are in denial.   I keep asking them to seek out psychologists for her or make her see someone.  They think she “isn’t that bad.”  Occasionally, a good family friend or relative will reach out to me and gently ask what’s up or how can they help.  My parents want me(33F) and the the rest of my adult siblings to refuse to answer their questions and change the subject to protect my sister’s dignity.  A few of the older generation relatives  believe she is just lazy and should start working at least at a McDonald’s etc…   I recently got frustrated with an older relative and said she isn’t just a lazy mooch she has some anxiety and depression.  Going to work at McDonald’s isn’t gonna fix her life. She needs to see a doctor.  When my dad found out I’d admitted to a relative my sister wasn’t a mooch and that I hinted that she likely had depression he blew up!  Said I was such a traitor and making her seem  worse than what she is. I tried to tell him after 7 freaking years people are going to start asking questions and it’s a little hard to dodge this question.  Was I wrong to admit she’s struggling? Is it better to let people think she’s a selfish scumbag?   I’m mad that my sister has this mental disease, I’m sad watching her life pass her by, I’m so mad at my parents for not getting her help, and I’m sick of being told to keep this a secret and let people think she’s a mooch instead of suggesting she might have a mental illness.   My parents also don’t want people the think she’s lazy or a mooch they are trying to protect her dignity but I think they are not being productive in their methods.  Anyone have any advice?",

    "self_text": "I spanked my daughter. She’s 5. She’s smart, kind, thoughtful, creative, funny…she’s my everything and I literally live for her. She is also the most stubborn, argumentative person I know and has the temper of…idk what. She argues every tiny little thing my husband or I say. It could be flood outside and if I say so, she would say it’s sunshine and rainbows. I’ve tried so many different ways to address this issue and I feel like nothing has worked. I do my best to be patient — I know one day she will learn to harness trait and use it for the positive…but only if I help her learn how. And tonight I feel like I failed. I sparked her. And I spanked her hard. It started with a game of checkers between her and her dad. Her dad was trying to teach her how to play but she wanted to make her own rules. My daughter lost it and began screaming. The more we tried to explain the louder she screamed. After about 10 minutes I took her to her room where she continued to scream and kick. She then began running away from me and was laughing. I lost it. I felt she was pushing my buttons and she thought it was funny. I laid her over my knee and spanked her. She cried a few a tears, but i think it mostly shocked her. Of course it did. She calmed down right after. I told her I lost my temper and said sorry. She also said sorry and we talked it out. I still feel horrible. I guess im looking for advice on parents with similar personalities as my child and how they handle their sanity during situations like these.  Update: I knew I’d get some hate and that’s okay. I have never been a spanker and don’t have a history of “anger issues”. And this situation was more about a “game of checkers”. It was the principle of the matter that she needed to learn that’s not the right way to act when you don’t get what you want. It was an immediate tantrum. What if she had been with a school mate? I wanted her to know how to compromise. I admit I handled it way wrong and should have disengaged from the start. I know that’s where I went wrong. It was not the right time for a teaching moment. That’s why I was here seeking advice. I do feel her arguing goes to the next level of “normal” so I’ll be looking more into that. I’m the meantime, I 100% intend to react different and be more mindful next time so that I don’t lose my temper. Thank you all to those with useful and caring advice. To the others, you may not have fucked up yet, but you will in the future in some way shape or form. I hope you receive some more useful and empathetic guidance than you gave me. But I get it, you’re angry. I did talk with her and apologize and let her know that what I did was not right at all and that i lost my cool. We will be okay.",

    "self_text": "(If you read this all and take the time to respond, I’m incredibly grateful. I know it’s lengthy and I think without the details, a lot of the meaning and intent would be lost. Thank you, in advance for any help or feedback.)  I’m a single parent of college-aged kids, dating a woman with a 12 y/o daughter and 16 y/o son. Her ex split almost 3 years ago. He was very secretive, unkind/unaffectionate and unfaithful. Within a week of the split, he had a “new” girlfriend; he has never introduced her to the kids because they said they don’t want to meet her.   My GF has been overcompensating with a lack of discipline with the kids, due to her not wanting to add any further stress to their lives. And she fears losing THEIR love since it has been the only love she’s had for the past 16 years.   I’ve discussed the following with her, but I think that she either doesn’t believe me, doesn’t want to admit it or feels it’s too difficult to change. I’m beginning to wonder if it’s me, and these things are totally normal or is there genuinely something wrong here that needs to change or else the kids will suffer as they grow into adulthood.     Because of the secrecy she dealt with from her ex, she doesn’t want the kids to feel she’s being secretive with them; She allows the kids (mostly it’s her daughter) free access to her phone, doesn’t shut her bedroom door and allows the kids to open mail/packages addressed to her. Her daughter has intercepted texts from me, and not only read them, but didn’t tell her about them. I’ve tried to explain to her the difference between secrecy and privacy and how she, AND the kids, deserve a level of privacy. Is this abnormal? Is it unhealthy short, and long, term for the kids?    We’re unable to talk on the phone, at all, whenever she has the kids (2/3 of the month) - Her son wants her to be happy but her daughter throws a fit whenever she has tried to talk to me: she once went outside to talk to me and ended up locked out of the house by the daughter, who refused to let her back in. Other times, she has just spewed vile, disrespectful, mean things at my GF. I understand that we don’t want to rush the f2f introduction to them, but the way she’s acting is totally inappropriate and should be reprimanded, else it will continue and likely get worse. Is this normal (the way she’s allowing her daughter to “rule the roost” and behave)? What are the long-term implications of allowing this to continue?    The 12 y/o frequently (more than half the time) sleeps in bed with my GF. She has her own room and bed, and isn’t coming to her in the middle of the night out of fear of the Boogie Man or anything…she just chooses to sleep there. Again, is this normal and what kind of detrimental effects, if any, could this have?    Thanks for reading. Any opinions, ideas or feedback will be appreciated.",

So obviously this is not great. I got him calmed down by promising him this isn't true, that mommy knows more than anyone else (lol), and also that daddy had accidents and he still has one. Maybe he'll be over it tomorrow, but I doubt it. He didn't want me to tell my husband and hid from him when he needed to pee again. So.

My husband wants our daughter to go stay at his moms house for the duration so the house stays clean and there’s no stress coming back to  Side note: husband is very OCD about mess and my mom is not very neat  I personally think it would be best to have my daughter stay home since this transition is going to be a lot by itself but my husband thinks I am overthinking this. I just think if we can keep her environment consistent then she might have an easier time transitioning to her baby sister. My daughter does sleep over his moms often but only once for an extended period when we were sick with COVID.   Any opinions are helpful please on what you think our plan should be. Thanks!",

For a while it was a spatula, later the dishwasher (and its contents), and now its our broom. He's got plenty of actual toys. We actually got him a little broom last week and he just prefers our full-sized one more!  As I'm always looking for new \"toys\" my 1yo will take interest in without breaking the bank, my question is this: what are some other non-toy \"toys\" (spatula, dishwasher, broom, etc)? I'm interested in \"toys\" for all age ranges, really.  Looking forward to hearing from the vast pool of knowledge that is r/Parenting :)",

We split in early October and ever since he has barley seen his son. If anything he will see our son once out of every week. This man has lied to me multiple times saying he’s “working” or that he “is tired” on the days that he wanted to see his son just so he can go smoke with his friends.   I’m convinced this man didn’t want any responsibility at all. He even left me with his dog and his cat. He gets to do whatever he wants during the week whiles I am stuck with all the responsibility of being a now single mom and having to pay so many bills by myself.   Recently he told me he was unable to purchase a car seat because he was in a financial bind. Which I understood (even though he makes way more than me and now has no bills since he moved back in with his mother). But that same week he bought a car. Not only did he buy a car but he slapped custom naked anime women all over it. This man did not need a car since he has a 2018 Ford and a work van. Then he calls me to tell me he won’t be able to see his son for the 4th time in a row because he is in a finical bind again. I-…   I don’t know what to do. Someone please lend some advice 😣.",

Multiple times today I was tearing up looking at them and just not feeling like enough.  I have an almost 2.5yo and almost 10mo. It could be the adjustment from going from having all the time in the world to myself to just abit of time with my first baby and then before I fully got the hang of it got pregnant again and now have zero time to myself. My baby doesn’t sleep great. Twice in almost 10 months he’s slept in til 5 (with night wakes) but other than that I’m up multiple times a night and holding him from atleast 4am onwards if not well before and then if my toddler wakes up I have to go in to try settle her too which wakes him since he won’t go back to sleep in his cot when I put him down but I can’t just leave her screaming.   Plus I just feeling crap not doing much with them in the day besides going to the park or a quick walk to the shops because I’m so tired and find it hard getting out with 2 kids plus not much money for something which would be easy to keep them occupied, plus sometimes with naps or doesn’t line up with my babies multiple naps and toddlers midday nap, I’m a crap cook and my toddler is so picky and hard to get much time to even cook with them both around and I hate serving up the same thing constantly and just feel like I’m not doing good enough. Then just looking at myself still abit overweight and looking a mess from having babies and not having time to even do any self care for myself unless I stay up late which seems stupid when I’ve barely slept the previous night and once I tidy up their mess and bottles etc it’s time for bed and won’t be long til my babies first wake of the night begins.  I used to be the type to love working out. I wish so bad they just both slept til 6:30 so I could wake at 5 and have time to myself and workout. That would be a dream. I know oneday it will happen but it’s so fucking hard. Nothing is mine anymore. I can barely pee without being whinged at let alone eat. The house is a mess. I spend the whole day tidying up after the little messes they makes and doing the basic chores however the house is still a mess at the end of the day. I just feel like a shit mum and even shittier wife.  My husband helps with shower/bath time which helps and does what he can but he works night shift, has to sleep in the day and also studies so his time is limited. Some parts of some days are honestly torturous for me at times. Not all the day but parts of the day. When I have them 1 on 1 its so easy and I love having time with them and they’re happy. But most the time it’s both of them and it’s just so hard. I wish I could split myself into 2 to be there for them how they want.   Maybe I’m just being a sook and need to get over it and do my job and lose a little more sleep. But I’m just struggling and don’t get how todo it all let alone even half of what I think I should be doing. I try things like meal prep or workout with the kids but doesn’t last long and I get a 30 second workout in. Everything just feels so hard right now.   Any advice or just assurance that it isn’t just me is welcome.   I ask for help from my mum sometimes but she works and so does my MIL and my sister has her own baby and is a single parent so not much option for help from family.",

He is on a ton of medication and toward the end of the window where it's about time to give it to him, he looks so bad we almost take him in again. He was full term, no complications, 8lbs5oz. I'm really struggling with the \"why\" of how it hit him this hard and when it will end. It honestly absorbs all my husband and I's waking moments and it's getting to the point where we both need to refocus on work and return to some normalcy for our other kids, but we can't. I'm wondering if anyone else has experience with RSV this severe and that has lasted this long? Did they go on to have a bad time with every cold? Did you discover some other underlying illness?

She has three full sets and they are barely in her life. My parents haven’t spoken to me in a decade, my husband’s mom and her husband are extreme narcissists and now his father and his wife had turned into completely different people.   Over the summer they invited me and and my out to stay with them while my husband was on a business trip. It an extremely awkward trip and it felt as if they were ignoring me and annoyed by me. So, I left early because my daughter was struggling and I felt trapped. When my husband got back home he was extremely concerned with his parent’s behavior, and showed me texts between his dad and him from before the trip. All of these texts were his dad “confirming” the details of the trip. He confirmed that my stepMIL was going to take off work, that they would take me to the grocery store, get the baby gear out of the garage and take their dogs to a daycare. None of that happened, even though there were multiple texts confirming that they could do it.   My husband had also called him at some point to let him know that our daughter still had struggles with warming up to people, with loud noises and voices, and in general is a clingy toddler. They were aware that we were worried about possible sensory disorders. All of which he said he understood. So it very confusing when they got frustrated with me when my daughter didn’t respond well to them.   But what really confused my husband was the construction going on at their house. The guest house that my daughter and I was supposed to stay in was partially under construction and they didn’t tell us beforehand. Apparently doing construction was a huge red flag. My husband calls his dad to find out what’s going on and his dad is extremely defensive. He starts claiming that I’m too possessive about my daughter. Conversation goes nowhere.   Eventually, my husband calls his sister to find out what’s going on, and it turns out his father decided to GO OFF HIS MOOD-STABILIZING MEDICINE and QUIT HIS JOB to trade CRYPTO. Apparently this happened last year. There are no words to describe how shocked we were when we found out. It explains why he’s so standoffish and skittish and why he spends all day in his room.   What ensued was months of family drama that I’m not going to get into, but now they’re pissed that we’re not interested in visiting for the holidays because we need a break from the drama. My husband has spent so much time being Fix It Felix for his entire family and we’re over it. The dream of my daughter having a relationship with her grandparents has been extinguished. At this point she has a better relationship with her great grandpa who still lives in my home country. The village is truly nonexistent.",

It means i'm unemployed, though i've been looking for work and am doing job interviews.  But the thing is that she finishes late every day, she arrives at 7pm, or 8pm.

Plus they seem to get more attached to me as i spend a lot of time with them, so even when my wife is there they sollicit me a lot, she's also tired so doesn't help that much in the evening and weekends (she does all that she can, i'm not complaining).  So i don't know, do you have any ideas to make it better? What stuff could i do with them? I'm not much into crafts, and we don't have cartoons during the week. It's just not very fun for me when they come, i even dread it a little bit...  &#x200B;  Edit: i don't know if those who commented will see this, but many thanks for the answers everyone, it really helped!!!   I've been trying to start by making sure they've eaten and drank. Then a quiet time with books, play'do. When they seem up for it we go to a small park close to us. I also try to be extra nice when they've just arrived, to allow them to release their emotions. And all of this has helped, i feel better with them in the evening and am calmer.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;",

    "self_text": "In 10 days, my boy will be 1 and we still feed him a bottle before bed and then sit in the chair to rock him to sleep. Recently (the past week) he has started going whole nights without waking from the 6:30/7pm we lay him down until about 4am. Sometimes during those nights he even stirs a bit but puts himself back to sleep. There are some spotty nights (every other, at most) where he wakes up twice (about 10/11pm and again about 3/4am) but he doesn't really chow down much on the bottles we offer then.  Anyway, my question is this? How should I tackle weaning him off both that bedtime feeding and also off the bottle (in favor of a sippy cup instead). Would doing it all at once be best? Or should I start with one and then do the other?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

    "self_text": "My daughter is about 2 and a half. She absolutely loves all things vehicles and dinosaurs. So when I saw the show dino trux on Netflix kids I was siked! Online rated it as safe for all ages and great. It was fine for a few episodes. She was loving it. Asking to watch it all the time. Then a couple in you meet the scraptors.  It went down hill so fast we didn't even finish the episode. Normally I prewatch everything I watched the first episode or 2 and it seemed fine. This time I didn't watch all of it and of course it ends up being a scary one.  Now she is having nightmares about dinos, saying scary dino roar. Dino give owie. The works. She thought the thunder yesterday was a dinosaur and absolutely lost it full blown freak out.  I'm doing my best to explain its all pretend, it's okay, she's safe, mama's got her too but nothing is helpful.  She was previously dino obsessed. A third of her toys for Christmas are dino related. She won't wear any of her dino clothes which is like 70 percent of them. I am at a loss I don't know what to do.  She is normally such a brave kid. But now any loud noise is dino rawr scary.  How do I fix this. How do I help her? And dear God be careful with that show with little ones.",

My son is 18 months old, he will be 2 in April. He’s a loving little boy, but my gosh does he like being naughty! It’s like he loves getting told off and I’m really fed up of it. He purposely looks around the room for things to do that he knows will make me tell him off. Be that climbing onto the dining table, tipping over the shoe rack, ragging my blinds, hitting the television with one of his toys etc etc…  He’s now stopped listening at nursery (he goes full time, Monday to Friday) he’s climbing on their tables too.  I’ve tried ignoring the behaviour, I’ve tried the naughty step but I feel he’s a bit young to understand that anyway.   For reference he is quite a clingy child, I’m still having to sit in his room until he’s gone to sleep at bedtime or he will scream the house down. He’s just the polar opposite of my eldest child, she was such a good toddler, always happy.",

    "title": "Parents separated and the other one is refusing to do anything for his kid, need advice",
    "self_text": "Hi so I wanted to talk about child support and custody agreements. Me and my sons dad split over 3 years ago. He made things impossible despite me trying to work with him, so I took him to court. He slacks a lot when it comes to our son and he wasn’t getting him to school when we were attempting 50/50 on our own. There were other issues but that was one of the main ones so I had to take him to court and I was given the majority of custody and he gets 3 weekends. Since then, he has only paid at the highest $7.85, in child support for 2 weeks at a time. Currently I’m getting nothing. He is a drunk and does drugs and apparently he is too busy for his son. He won’t keep a job at all either. He doesn’t pick him up like he should for the weekends but even when he does, he bails him off on everyone. One time his then girlfriend even messaged me telling me she felt bad for our son because he was never home and would go to the bar instead of spending time with him and she was watching him all those times. He moves a lot and I heard the same from a few other people he lived with and still have in writing. He promises our son that he will spend more time with him or get him extra during the week, which he is more than allowed to and I encourage because my son wants to see his dad, but it’s all lies and he never goes through with it. My son is 8 and starting to act out bad because he misses him. Which tbh is really stressful on top of doing the work for me and what his dad should be doing.  When he is with him, they don’t do homework. He hasn’t done it at all yet with him. He doesn’t make him bathe or brush his teeth and lets him stay up till 2-3 am waiting on him to get home, if he comes home that day. His dad is usually hung over when I pick son up on Sunday and I’m getting sooooo frustrated. He doesn’t buy him anything or help at all and the whole $7.85/2weeks in child support isn’t shit. So I told him nicely and professionally I suppose, that he was not doing what he needed to and I’m getting tired of it. I told him that I should not have to be both parents because he can’t be mature at all. Also, since I buy everything for our son, I got his Halloween costume this year and as hoping his dad would actually spend time with him and take him trick or treating so I sent it there with him. He wouldn’t even bother getting him one and going otherwise, and of course it didn’t come home. So I asked him to return it and he got mad at me saying it isn’t a big deal but since he does next to nothing and I just bought it not even 2 weeks beforehand, I wanted it back.   He still hasn’t returned it but demanded me to return school clothes to him that sons dads mom (sons grandma) bought. I told him no because he didn’t even buy them to begin with and that is all I’ve gotten for school from ‘him’. That he still needs to be helping me! So now when he goes for the weekends, his dad takes his good clothes and sends him ones with giant holes that he can not wear to school.   I am honestly exhausted with this and have tried way longer than need be to be nice. I can feel my blood boiling at this point. What do I do? Print all this or what? What will the court do for this kind of thing? I need some kind of help from him because I’m struggling right now to do everything on my own. And I’m tired of asking nicely. Will they give him less visits? Is it a waste since he was already ordered to pay almost nothing?   Just to add, It frustrates me even more because he tells everyone he pays a lot in child support and that he’s always there for his son and that I make things difficult for him. He says he’s ‘doing his best’ when he can’t even pick up the phone and call him, and that his life is ‘chaos’ that he can’t do things anytime I ask because he’s ‘too broke’. But then goes on vacations and goes out drinking very regularly. He’s also only been working 4 hour shifts while I’m doing 12s to try to make things work. Will they make him get a better job or make me pay him since I make more? Which would be NONSENSE if they did make me. I’m so over this!!!",

    "title": "Sleep trained baby suddenly up all night!",
    "self_text": "Hello,  I really hope someone can help me out because I’m at my wits end!  Our son is 5 months old. About 3 weeks ago his night wake ups got so bad we had to sleep train. We used Ferber method and after 3/4 days he had cracked self settling. We had about a week of great naps and great sleeps (waking up once or twice but doing 6-8 hour stretches), until suddenly he was hit with his first cold! Suddenly he was snotty, sneezy and miserable and up all night. We couldn’t feed to sleep as he no longer has that association so we just made sure we were with him in the room while he was upset, and comforted him the best we could.   Fast forward to now, he’s much better, bar an annoying dry cough (the type you have for a week or so after you’re sick), but his sleep is crazy and really looking for advice. He can still self settle, when we put him down for his naps and bedtime we just stick him in his bed, do a little song then leave the room and he’s usually asleep within a few minutes. He’s linking naps and doing a good 2 hour mid day nap that we have to wake him up for. However, night times are a completely different ball game. He’s basically up every two hours crying and crying and moaning and crying. We leave him cry in the night and he usually stops within anywhere between 15-30 minutes. Then wakes up 2 hours later to repeat the whole thing again! Last night we had the worst night ever, when he went to bed he cried for 45 minutes, then woke anywhere between every 30 mins to his longest stretch 1.5 hours. Ever sleep we left him to cry and he would settle back down after about 15-20 mins but the wake ups were so constant it’s left us absolutely exhausted today. We do 2 night feeds (which is consistent every night - around 4 hours after his last  feed) usually 11-12 and 3-4am.   Wake windows are about 2 hours 15 to 2 hours 30. First sleep is usually 45 mins, second sleep 2 hours, third sleep 15 mins.  Bedroom is blackout, white noise, we sleep in the same room but had to put the sides on the next-to-me bed and put him away from the bed, which was an act of desperation a couple of days ago. This helps a little as there’s a bit more distance between us and him so neither of us wake with any slight noise.  I feel like we are mailing everything bar these damn night wake ups! What am I missing?? Thought it might be a hidden sleep association with feeling full as we usually feed him 20-30 mins before each sleep? Or something to do with his wake windows? Or is it teething (he is dribbling and chewing a lot) and/or a 5 month growth spurt? Or getting over his cold still? Any insight or advice will be hugely appreciated!!  Thank you!",

Spent hours combing through my son's hair. Then after the first day, spending an hour each day to make sure there isn't anything new.    Washed every piece of fabric that can be washed, hot water, dryer on hot.    Sealed everything that cannot be washed into bags, going to let them sit there for 2 weeks to be sure any lice are dead.    Change bedding every day.

I understand that people want to be open and gender neutralized and such and I have absolutely no problem with that, if that is THEIR choice. But my daughter gets called a boy often and it drives me crazy. During a 20 minute grocery store trip today she got called a boy THREE times. She doesn't have much hair yet and maybe that's why they just assume, but she can have a shirt on that literally says \"little sister\" and people still call her a boy. She doesn't like bows on her head and I just don't feel like it's worth it to pierce her ears this young. I look at her and just think she's to dang pretty to be a boy, but it happens almost every time we leave the house.   Ok..rant over. I'm just really butthurt over this.  Edit: some.. ok MOST of you guys seemed to take this in a way it was not intended for. I, personally, get annoyed when my daughter is called a boy because my efforts of dressing her in more of a feminine outfit are completely ignored. It's more of a feminine or masculin issue, not about genitals. Genitalia wasn't even on my mind when I thought about this and I find it kinda disgusting that yall went straight to that.

She’s always been a great sleeper, but in the past week or so, she’s started waking between 1 and 2 AM screaming at the top of her lungs, crying, just generally flipping out. I go in and rock her, she settles, I put her back down, and within ten minutes she’s back at it. I’ll go in again and rub her back and soothe her, but the second I turn to leave, she starts again. She’s not sick, no fever. It seems like she just wants me in the room. I’m at my wits end. I’m an ER nurse and work 12 hour shifts and I can’t keep losing 2 hours of sleep in the middle of every night. The crying and screaming is heartbreaking, but it stops the SECOND I walk in the room.

    "title": "Parental controls for teenagers? Especially for smartphones? Feels like all or nothing.",
    "self_text": "I'm not trying to go completely psycho, but my kid has behavior issues. Most would refer to her as a \"troubled teen.\" I just want to find a middle ground between, \"I have a phone for safety, to contact my friends, any hotlines or anything needed for resources, and to use the apps my parent chooses\" and \"I have free reign to anything.\" At one point she had a flip phone which was the medium point, but she was made fun of at school because we are kinda poor compared to others in our area, and after better behavior over the summer I bought her a prepaid smartphone. She has backslid in behavior and it is apparent her relationship with the internet  The thing is, she is 13. I looked to see if I could add Google Family Link to her device which seemed like a great idea but it says after 13 they can opt out of any supervision. If this would just lock the device, that would be great! She can agree to be supervised, or only be able to access emergency numbers. This however does not seem to be the case.  What I am looking to do:   Block specific numbers. During my child's time with her father she began meeting strangers on Discord and her interactions with some of these people are... problematic at best. However, on the no contract phone plan I was on, I had no access to block specific numbers. I thought since the phone was under my name I could do that or view some kind of call log, but that was not the case.  Possibly view incoming text/phone call logs. This is not to be completely crazy, it is to see if there are recurring phone numbers that are not local that pop up.  Be able to turn off data usage period at will. (Smartphone) The reason I want this is because if school is not attended I want to be able to turn off data entirely for the day. On or off. And control the hours it may be used.   &#x200B;  What I have already done/have brainstormed:   Discord is blocked entirely on my router. You have to be on phone data, which she had a limited amount so she could not really use it excessively.  May possibly block Tiktok/Instagram and some other big social medias until trust can be rebuilt. (She has been sneaking, lying, etc. and it needs to stop. She can have a life, but lying and sneaking is something that has escalated and I want to put an end to it.)  Have learned how to use my IP address to view what is being accessed via wifi  Will be adding Firewalla most likely, which will show me spikes in bandwidth to know if a VPN is being used via large bandwidth usage alerts to bypass the controls in place.   &#x200B;  If anyone has any suggestions or advice for parental controls for kids who are 13+ but aren't making wise choices with technology other than turning everything off and only providing them with a \"dumb phone\" please let me know. I will do the dumb phone if I have to, but she does have a hard time making friends here and has a few she has made when she came with me to anime conventions and such, and she does like to play games with them and stream things and I don't want to take that from her unless I have to since she has a hard time fitting in with the kids around here.",

His parents had been both on meth all throughout the pregnancy until the last couple months, and then continued after he was born. They smoked around him constantly, and never showed him any affection. Now that I have complete guardianship of him, I can really see the damage that they inflicted. They never fed him regular food, only milk in a bottle, and now he refuses to eat anything and only wants a bottle of milk. Sometimes without any apparent reason, he will start screaming and throwing things. He just recently began walking, and the only sounds he makes are hums or screams or growls. I’m more worried about the food situation, he looks malnourished and will cry and throw a fit whenever I try giving him food. I’m new to parenting and I have no idea what to do. Any tips on how to transition from solely milk to food? Please help!",

    "self_text": "Hi!  I've always been praised for my calm and my patience. I worked in retail and never lost my temper even with the shitties of customers. Then I worked at a school, with demanding kids who had tantrums, ran away, and said all kinds of mean things to me, but there I also never snapped.  Then I became a parent. My idea of being a parent was that I would always be a calm and patient with my child, that I would be a great listener and respond to their challenges by pausing for a moment and figuring out the smartest course of action.  Spoiler alert: It didn't quite pan out that way. My child is now a one year old, and I don't have enough patience with him. He's not a particularly challenging child. Most of the time he's happy, calm, and curious. But like with all toddlers, there are moments where he is really hard to deal with, and in these moments I tend to respond in really annoying and immature ways.  I am writing this here because I am asking for your advice, or maybe just some words of wisdom. How do you stay patient with your child?",

    "title": "How do you deal with not agreeing with a punishment from your kids school?",
    "self_text": "My son is 8 and in 4th grade. He has ADHD, separation anxiety disorder, and various behavioral issues. He has an IEP and his teacher (literally the sweetest, kindest lady on the planet) has developed a non verbal system with him to where he can signal he needs a minute if he's feeling overwhelmed or angry. Idk if any of this is relevant.   Ok so today I picked him up for a therapy appointment and was informed that he was in the principals office sitting by himself in a conference room. He was supposed to sit quietly until I got there. I was also told there was an incident report in his backpack. Yay. It read like this  Today Mr. Principal invited Riv to his office to eat lunch and have a friendly chat. Initially, Riv was cooperative, friendly, and very responsive to the questions and discussion prompts from Mr. Principal. However, shortly after entering the room he started having a disrespectful attitude and speaking to Mr. Principal in a sarcastic tone of voice. Attempts were made to correct this behavior and were unsuccessful. Due to his disrespectful attitude, he will be sitting in a conference room alone for the duration of the week during lunchtime.   I am supposed to sign it and return it. My issue is, the reason my son got upset was because the principal would ask him something and my son would start to answer and the principal would cut him off or interrupt him while he was talking to pick up the phone. He was also fiddling with his cell phone when my son was talking. My son told me he started feeling frustrated because of these things.  My son apparently answered one of his questions and asked him one in return and the principal was looking at his phone and didn't respond so my son said \"ok. Good talk\", and rolled his eyes and sighed. After that he shut down and refused to engage anymore. He was giving one word responses and thumbs up or thumbs down to answer questions.   My son does not do well with constant interruptions or interjections. He gets overwhelmed and anxious and I don't really understand why the principal wanted to do a get to know you meeting if he was clearly busy.  I'm not saying he was right to be disrespectful but I kinda think the principal was being a little disrespectful too? I do think my son should have expressed that he was getting frustrated before shutting down or being rude. I do, however, feel like the punishment is unfair and should have just ended today with him waiting for me.   I really am trying to not undermine the principal especially since we've already had an incident this year that got us off on the wrong foot. I just think he's dead wrong here and idk if I should do anything or let it go.  Edit. Update if anyone is interested. I emailed the principal this morning and told him that I would not sign off on the punishment, that I felt the punishment was inappropriate and that I had questions about what happened yesterday.   I also brought up his IEP and how his behavioral issues as well as strategies to minimize those issues are listed in his IEP and that forced isolation isn't one of them. I also said that I wanted to formally request an IEP meeting so that we can all go over the IEP and make sure it reflects his current needs and concerns.   He wrote back saying that he wasn't going to have him miss lunch for 3 days, that they're off on Friday for Veterans day so it only would have been 2. And that he doesnt need my signature to move forward with his decision but that he would consult with the social worker to get any alternative suggestions instead of the lunch thing. He said he would reach out about the IEP meeting after the weekend. That was it. It's going to be a long year  Edit 2. I also talked to the social worker and made sure he wasn't pulled from lunch. He apologized to the principal unprompted and they added an extra 1 on 1 (him and the social worker) to practice different ways of handling feelings of frustration",

This year he has done this twice and had to leave school early. He has been telling the teacher \"no\" and we thought this was a continuation of what we called \"shut down learner\" last year.

But I feel like it never works out. 😂 Two minutes in my oldest will want a sandwich. Then next thing baby topples over while crawling and cries. Then my toddler needs to poo. Then he'll play too rough with his baby brother and I need to intervene. Then I'll notice the door to the kitchen is left open and baby is crawling to something dropped by my toddler I hadn't picked up yet... You get the picture; pure chaos.  I know kids have many needs and I don't get frustrated with them, but I do get frustrated with the video call! I usually end up calling it quits (literally in this case) after 10 mins when we've barely had any conversation. I've noticed every time we have these family calls, the chaos with my kids (the oldest mainly) gets WORSE. He gets really hyper active, maybe even over-stimulated(?). And then I'm like no, sorry, I'm not going to multi-multi-task between two kids and family member(s) on the video call... 🤷‍♀️  For serious talk I can obviously wait to call until the children are asleep, but then there's no relationship building between them and extended family.  Am I the only one that can't handle this? 😂 It's a bit different when my husband is there too, but it rarely works out that way.",

    "self_text": "Hi there! I’m a first time parent and my family decided to go to the mountains for Christmas. We are planning on bringing our son who will be 12 months old at that time, and I have no idea what I’m doing.   He will not be skiing or anything, but we will definitely be outside sometimes. We currently live in the southern USA and usually never even have snow, so I haven’t got a clue how to prepare a baby for those types of temperatures.   Supposedly, 12 month olds are already walking so I just have no idea what kind of gear we will need to make sure he stays a safe body temperature.   Do we need snow boots? Are there special waterproof socks that we need to buy? Some of the snow suits have feet on them, if we get that do we still need boots? Do 12 month olds tolerate gloves?   Does anyone have any tips for bringing a 12 month old on a ski trip?  Need some help, and I’m very overwhelmed. Thank you!",

I am conscious of the fact they haven’t really been exposed to those much less fortunate than themselves - although my daughter is quite mature for her age and I’ve taken her with me to a couple volunteer activities like a book drive for underprivileged kids where she handed out books to low income kids who were beyond thrilled to be receiving a book, and to Florence Crittendon High School that caters to underprivileged teen mothers. My son though, has not been similar exposed. I think he’s a little young and still too immature to understand the teen mom volunteer projects I do and the book nonprofit I volunteered with shuttered a while back.   Can anyone recommend a great way to volunteer that is age appropriate and helps them understand that it’s important to be grateful for what we have and also to give back to our community?

This last week I had to take 4 days off for the flu.  My job has a $2,000 sign on bonus with 500 at your 6 months which was over looked recently. And I've been told that I'm probably no longer going to receive it due to my call ins. I'm so frustrated because while I completely understand why it's not like I can just send my kids to school and daycare with the flu. My husband makes over double what I do, so it makes zero sense for him to take off over me. I'm sure if I worked anywhere else other than here I'd be fired by now. I'm just so flustered I dont know what to do.  I dont have family that can take them. My husband has agreed to try and work with his schedule to hopfully salvage my sign on bonus but if we cant i think I'm just going to leave my job while this wave of sicknesses pass. We can afford for me to not work but It'd just be tight. My job is mostly \"fun money\" anyway.   I dont expect a pass just because I have kids but it seriously sucks when me having to call in is unavoidable. My boss is understanding but the owner is less then. These gross sicknesses need to go away.  Thanks for listening to my life issues",

I’ve tried swatting his hand (I know, I know…desperate here), yelling, etc. If I take away story time he just gets amped up to ten and gets aggressive and explodes. When he is aggressive, I have tried to hold him close and talk normally to him and tell him, “I’m going to hold you until you calm down so you don’t hurt yourself or others”. That doesn’t work because he thrashed so wildly I can’t hold him down.   He’s honestly a super sweet boy, sings songs to his sister about how she is special, tells us he loves us 100x a day, etc but this behavior has thrown me for a loop.

    "title": "Whole Family Terribly Sick and Antibiotic Shortage",
    "self_text": "I am running on fumes. My whole family is so sick. Long post. But should read cuz I know this stuff is spreading fast! And apparently there’s a major antibiotic shortage!  I will preface all of this to say I don’t usually even go to the doctor for sinus stuff. Which is why I took so long to take any of us to the doctor. I find these things almost always resolve themselves with OTC medicines to help symptoms.  All started about a week before Halloween. My oldest (4) who is in preschool, had what appeared to be a cold. Basic cold symptoms, runny nose and cough. After being awake for an hour or 2 she would get pretty clear and besides a rogue sneeze was herself. No fever. We tried some OTC meds and let it run it’s course. By Halloween she was seeming better. Just a touch of lingering cough but nothing awful. My husband went out of town the day after Halloween.   Then my throat started to get scratchy. But I have really bad pitted tonsils and tonsil stones all the time. I looked and my tonsils were swollen up but I had no other symptoms. Not even snotty. At first.   As the week went on my baby (4.5 months) started getting snotty. Nothing bad. Just sucked her nose clear and ran humidifier. But she wasn’t sleeping as well obviously. Between that and my own throat soreness I got very little sleep. Less than 4hrs each night.  By Friday I had the snotty nose. My husband was supposed to be driving home. And I was gonna tag out for a day and rest. But he woke up Friday morning puking. He drove 6 hours home, pulling over to puke. So then we isolated him to the basement and the kids didn’t even know he was home from his trip.   My sinuses got worse on Saturday. By Sunday my husband joined us upstairs finally. My tonsils were so swollen I could touch my tonsils together if I flexed my throat.  My youngest was getting more stuffy but doing ok. My oldest’s cough was getting worse again. Ultimately the sheer size of my tonsils and my concern about RSV or something bad in my youngest prompted me to take everyone to the doctor the next day. I was unsure if my oldest needed to be seen but if I’m taking one kid, might as well take both.   So I called in Monday and took myself and kids to the doctor. Well tried. Pediatrician said they don’t have room to see us. I was pissed. I tried to find someone else to see the kids but no one would see my baby because she’s not 6mos. So I would have to take her to the children hospital and it wasn’t hospital level I thought. So I called back pediatrician and begged just to see my youngest. I could always take my oldest to a walk in place if needed. After giving them grief for a few minutes they did make room to see my youngest.   I went to my doctor first. They were shocked at my tonsil swelling. But I test negative for Strep, Flu, and Covid. They decide it has to be a sinus infection and that was simultaneously causing the tonsils to swell so badly. They gave me a steroid shot because they were concerned about the tonsils. And antibiotics called in. I checked on the antibiotics immediately and it said they wouldn’t be ready for a few hours.  Went to pediatrician with baby. They thought she had RSV but tested negative. Since her eyes had a constant mucus and her ears were questionable they decided it was a sinus infection. But they said they could hear something starting in her chest as well. They ended up giving antibiotics and nebulizer treatments with arbuterol.   Went to the pharmacy for all our meds. Al they had was the arbuterol. No antibiotics and they wouldn’t have them for a while. The pediatrician’s after hours like couldn't do anything to get a different prescription. My mom called a dozen pharmacies and found my June baby’s prescription and drove an hour at 10pm to get it. I just let mine go until the morning because I figured it wasn’t an emergency. My baby was our main concern, wanting to make sure she didn’t get worse.  The next day on Tuesday I called my doctor and they called in a different antibiotic. I could feel myself getting a lot worse. My voice was completely gone almost and my eyes were starting to drain mucus even in the middle of the day. Not just after sleeping. Pharmacy recording said it’d be ready at 11:30. I show up at 12. They didn’t fill it because my insurance wouldn’t cover. I said I’d pay whatever it cost but I HAD to have these drugs. I started crying when they told me. I was desperate.  They walk away and whisper. Finally they come back and say “well it will take an hour” so I leave. Still crying. When I come back they say “well actually we are out of that antibiotic too. But we do have only 8 left. That’s not enough for your prescription but we will give you these then you can come back Friday when our order comes in” Like what? Why didn’t you just tell me this an hour ago? What is happening? Anyway.  I got home and realized my eyes were really really red and swollen. By 3pm my eyes were majorly swollen. And totally red. Like the whole white of my eye. And my whole face seemed puffy. I called my mom and asked her to meet me at doctor to take my kids. I saw the same doctor. It had only been like 28 hours since she’d seen me last time. She was SHOCKED.  My throat was still swollen. My voice completely gone when it had only been slightly off the day before. And my eyes. I definitely had pink eye. She said a bad sinus infection can turn into pink eye. I should have been able to have 3 doses of antibiotics at this point but I’d only had 1 thanks to the pharmacy not having any. So she prescribed eye ointment antibiotics for the pink eye and she gave me an antibiotic shot because she was worried about how fast it seemed to be progressing. I went home and laid in bed with my eyes closed.   My husband had to stay home on Wednesday because I couldn’t take care of the kids with pink eye. He also took our oldest to a new pediatrician who said she also needed antibiotics because of how her chest sounded and an ear infection. Which honestly shocked me: she had no ear complaints. Obviously the pharmacy didn’t have her antibiotics either. But her new doctor actually called the pharmacy and got it figured out and found something they did have that would work.  Now it’s Thursday and I think I’m finally getting better. But my husband is now getting sick. And I give up.  Any advice on how to keep my husbands turn with this thing from turning into a full blown infection?",

Moments of seemingly endless wondering of what my life will be like when my purpose has grown and become his own person. Moments of a strong desire to have another child so I can experience the beginning stages all over again because I miss them so so much. The fucked up part? All those thoughts and feelings go out the window when he wakes up and pushes my buttons and frustrates me. I can't seem to enjoy the moments that I know I will miss one day, just like I miss the moments from when he was smaller. Instead, I find myself missing the times before he was born. The times that I only get a taste of when he is down for a nap. The times of quiet and solitude. And yet, when I am in those moments of quiet and solitude, I find myself missing him. It's an endless cycle. I am struggling to find myself outside of being a mother, something I never thought I would struggle with. But the issue is, I had lost who I am as a person before I even became a mother. Before I became a mother I was already struggling to find my purpose and who I am as a person outside of depression and anxiety. When my son was first born and until recently, I felt I had found my purpose. To raise this beautiful human being to be a kind soul with independence and who is caring of others. But as time quickly goes by I find myself wondering how I can teach these things to him as someone who feels they have no identity. Every goal I have had is never accomplished. And I have no motivation to work on these goals i have had. Who am I, outside of a mother? That is something I'd like to discover, but unfortunately my time to do these discoveries is placed in a limited time frame during naps. And during these naps, instead of discovering who I am and working on myself I find myself scrolling endlessly on tiktok or other social media. Flipping back and forth between different social media platforms. And then the nap ends and I feel annoyed because I accomplished nothing in the time I had and I am back to simply being a mother. I love being a mom and I love my son, but how do I find myself among the chaos?",

And he will point to or pat my belly and say \"baby.\" I bought him a baby doll to introduce him to the idea of having a baby around, but he hasn't shown much interest.

    "self_text": "Firstly I’m not sure if this is an international thing or just where I am.   Since having my first baby (now 4 weeks old) people constantly ask if she’s sleeping through the night. She isn’t she wakes up every 3-4 hours for a feed (Formula fed) which our GP has advised is perfectly normal and if she sleeps beyond the 4 hours to wake her for a feed.   Once we answer telling them she’s not sleeping through the night they inevitably say that their children were 1/2 weeks and they were sleeping through the night. I’ve mentioned to one or two people that our GP advised waking her and they mention ‘never wake a sleeping baby’ she’ll never sleep through the night if we wake her.   We haven’t woken her, but that’s purely because we don’t have to she wakes every 4 hours herself. If she does though I’d wake her, because that’s what we’ve been told to do by our doctor. She’s only 4 weeks so I’m pretty sure she needs the nutrition.   It almost comes across in a bragging way? They’ll say things like ‘Our Eva was great at seeping, after the first week she’d sleep for 8/9 hours at night’ or ‘We never had that issue with Tom’   Am I being a silly here and there some unspoken rule that everyone lets their baby sleep though the night and just doesn’t admit it?

    "self_text": "Hi there! Posting on my friends behalf since she needs advice as a first time parent.  my friend is with her daughter 24/7. She is a SAHM who is attending classes online, and also has a boyfriend who works out of town and only is able to come home for 4 days every other week.   She has a one year old daughter who has become accustomed to needing to sleep in the same bed as her mom, plus needing her mom to fall asleep along with her. If my friend moves to get up to use the washroom, leave her sight, or tries to put her down to sleep in her own crib her daughter will wake up and cry until she is back in bed with mom.  My friend is starting to try and find a way to get her used to sleeping in her own bed again, and teaching her to fall asleep without the aid of mom laying with her so my friend can use the time she sleeps to do school work, or spend time with her boyfriend.  So back to the main question. What were ways you found worked when teaching your children to sleep in their own bed? She would appreciate any help and support!",

    "self_text": "Hi, I have a 2 and a bit year old who is and always has been a great sleeper. I then have my 10months old who has always been a terrible sleeper. We spent 2 weeks sleep training him with the CIO method, (we tried many others previously and nothing was working). He finally started to fall asleep in his bed on his own and even slept through from 10pm-5am a few nights in a row.  Since we started we have kept him in our bedroom and we have been sleeping in the living room on air mattresses. We live in a 2 by 1 so we don’t have a lot of options.  Well it’s now week three and a half and shit has hit the fan. He is now waking for hours screaming and crying with no apparent issues. It started with him waking around 2am and not going back down for unless I nursed him and now it’s 2-3times for 1hr or more at a time. He is napping well and predictably, and he goes down for bedtime fine. He eats plenty throughout the day and has 4 breastfeeding sessions. He isn’t sick but he does have signs of teething..  I am looking for some advice on what to do, I feel like we are going backwards and starting the unwanted habits again as it’s the only way to get him to sleep in the night. I really want my bed and room back and to be free of the air mattresses in the living room. I’m failing this kid.",

    "self_text": "Hi all -  I just purchased an amazon fire kids tablet for my daughters, 3 and 5. I occasionally let the kids play a game on my phone/tablet as an incentive or to get them to zonk out for a bit when my wife and I need some down time. I bought them kids tablets cause I wanted to stop handing out my own electronics.  Anyway, while my wife and I were setting up the tablets last night we realized that the Fire comes with a million preloaded apps. They play up all the parental controls, but then don't give me any control over what apps are available to my kids, only that they are age appropriate. I am not worried about any individual app, but it is just such a crazy overload of stimuli and choice.   I'll likely end up returning them to Amazon. I'd ideally like a tablet with a couple of apps--one or two games and maybe some music. I guess I am looking for something more akin to a normal ipad but with better parental controls. Does anyone have suggestions?",

    "self_text": "Hi everyone. This is a repost from r/toddlers and I am the OP. I just wanted to copy my post onto here to get more input.  . . .  Im frustrated  Hi everyone. This may be a bit long so if you get through reading this whole thing, thank you so much for sticking around.  My son is 3 years old. He has a speech delay and has been attending speech therapy since the beginning of this year. He had a mild receptive speech delay and severe expressive delay. Ever since he’s been in therapy, he’s made so much progress! I’m so proud of him and how far he’s come. He can follow directions and his receptive skills have jumped. He still has a lot of ways to go but it’s been great progress. Expressive wise, he’s definitely gotten better. He used to say some single words but he’s now saying 2-3 word phrases such as “oh cool!” “Uh oh” “ready set go!” He says colors, shapes and can identify them, including animals. I’m just so proud of him.  My frustration isn’t with him. My frustration lies with my husband. A little bit of background.. I’m a stay at home mom. I’ve been one for a couple of years now. I quit my last job just before lockdowns began in 2020 and I was staying with my son full time (and I am even now). My husband works. He doesn’t get to see us as much because he’s been putting in 12 hour shifts at his new job. They constantly offer overtime so he’s sometimes gone 5 nights a week. These days, he’s just been telling me that “he’s still not talking, he’s only identifying.” It’s really infuriating me. First of all, why can’t he look at the things he  can  do rather than saying shit like this? I guess having a toddler with a speech delay has honestly taught me to be grateful for what we  do  have, and what we  can  do. I have talked to him about this before. He can say some words and 3 word phrases and he’s constantly improving, and I told my husband this, and he’s even seen him say words. But he still keeps saying shit like ”he can’t talk yet.” I’m the one who’s gotten him into speech therapy, making appointments, I take him there 2 times a week, I’ve contacted our local school district for school based services and we have an appointment with them next month. We went to a child development pediatrician and it’s possible he could have mild ASD, and we have an appointment with a psychologist for an autism test. I am doing everything I can. I practice with him what we learn in speech therapy, at home. Everything is in progress. I’m not saying this to “keep score” but I am doing whatever I can, in my power to help our son. I can only do my best. It’s not like there’s a magic pill to get kids talking straight away. I mean, does he think you can switch souls with your son, go inside of his body to talk for him? Like he’s expecting results in his timeframe. He just can’t enjoy our son as he is right now? Like he’s focused on the things he can’t do (which he can btw. He’s gotten better but apparently my husband expects more). I’m getting riddled with so much anxiety.   Can anyone relate?  *edited for spelling",

    "self_text": "My wife and I have 11 and 8 year old daughters.  Both girls are healthy, smart, do well in school and are great kids in general.  This school year, my older daughter has made several close friends with other girls in her class.  This is great, they seem like good kids, and its made my daughter very happy.  The only issue is that her friends all have older siblings, and so the standards in their houses can be pretty different than our own due to having high schoolers as old as 18 around.  Her friends have much later bed times, are allowed to watch much more adult shows, play more adult video games, and in some cases have their own cell phones already due to being the younger sibling.  We've allowed her to stay up about 30 minutes later than her little sister if she reads in her room, but otherwise find ourselves saying \"No honey, you're just not old enough for that yet\" to a lot of other things she asks about, which leads to her being frustrated.  We certainly don't want for it to seem like we're punishing her, and we aren't overly conservative or prudish with what we let the kids do, but we just think that there are reasonable age limits for middle schoolers that we aren't ready to budge on.  Does anyone have suggestions of what they did with their oldest kids in this kind of situation?  What worked and what didn't?",

    "self_text": "So my daughter has always had trouble with sleep. Since she was in utero she was always a night owl. Fairly consistently for the last few months, she has gone to bed between 9pm and 11pm, (it used to be 12am to 3am until she was about 1 year), nap time starting anywhere from 1pm to 4pm, depending on the day. We try to keep her naps to 90 minutes unless she seriously fights us on getting up, then it's roughly 2 hours. If she goes to sleep between 9pm and 11pm, she usually gets up between 8am and 10am. She can now climb out of her crib and come into bed with us whenever she wants (it's not high up at all and she is highly coordinated for not even 2 yet) despite us being frank with her about staying in her bed.  I will often sing her to sleep for 30+ minutes, but she still screams/cries and climbs out to come find me or my husband as soon as I set her down. We did co-sleep until she was 9ish months, and then we began with the crib which seemed to work out fine if we caught her when she was sleepiest (this no longer works, at all, as she immediately springs up when we set her down.) She likes music when she sleeps as well, so we try to have lofi or classical on for her for comfort.   She truly is a wonderful child and I couldn't be more grateful, but I am at a loss as to what to do. We know we are going to convert her bed to a toddler bed, but we need to purchase the parts to do it (for some reason it didn't come with it) and we have to make sure they still exist, otherwise it'll just be a brand new bed. My husband theorizes that she just wants her big girl bed because she prefers our bed as well, but I have no idea if that will fix everything.",

It's my understanding that I can't contribute to any IRA or 401k obviously due to not having earned income - I'm still unclear whether the income supplements have tax liability or not. It's difficult to get an answer because it's very specific to my state (CA) and the fact that I've been on extended disability (and not PFL).  Due to my income level pre-maternity leave, and the untaxed income supplement, I've been able to save a lot of cash this year.

I keep thinking if I leave her with my husband for a weekend and she has to have a few nights without me that might be the quickest (but also most painful and traumatic to her) method. Has anyone been in this situation and can offer valuable non-judgy insight? Tbh I am afraid of getting a bunch of \"JUST LET HER CRY\" responses. Is that really the best solution? What if she goes on crying for over an hour? I am OBVIOUSLY A FIRST TIME PARENT. Please be gentle and hopefully have tried-and-tested advice :)",

We had our 1 year jabs 1.5week ago and since then, she's something else. Constantly needy, constantly whinging, fighting her naps (luckily still sleeping all night)and literally being the opposite of what she was. Now, I'm not saying it's the jabs but she was fine before them!  Am I missing something? Is there some developmental thing that just makes parenting not fun after the 13 month mark?",

Nothing has seemed to really work as she wakes up some time during the night and immediately starts wailing. It isn't because she's rolling from her bed or uncomfortable, I check her diaper and everything. No hair tourniquet, plenty warm, she even has a pillow lovey that she cuddles with to make it seem like she has someone else.   I'm at a loss and just tired.

Sometimes it takes her 4-5 hours till she falls asleep, I can’t even take a shower at night when her dads not home because of how often she gets out of her bed. The only thing that slows down the constant getting out of bed is turning out all the lights and everything in the house and pretending to go to sleep, but I’d like my time at night to do things without having to pretend to sleep.",

This has been going on since about 8 months. I've had to walk around with ear plugs in or else my ear drums get pulverized.  Things that cause shrieking to happen  - Bed/nap time. Oh you bet there's going to be shrieking - Taking clothes on and off. - When she's done eating/doesn't like what's put in front of her - bored - Tired - Happy - Hungry - poops her pants and we have to clean her butt. Oh, you bet she's going to shriek. Yesterday she missed her second nap because she had to poop, which resulted in a SEVEN HOUR wake window. I'm convinced she holds it in until the last possible moment where it hurts. - not letting her twist like a gator when changing her diaper. Child, I am doing this, so you don't pee everywhere. God.  Plus, a litany of other problems at the moment including teething, daylight savings, being constantly over tired. She's also suffering from absurd levels of separation anxiety. Due to this level 99 clinginess, this is how nap time goes.   shrieking because it's nap time  nurses  Won't sleep, chooses to climb all over mommy instead.  mommy leaves  shrieking and wailing ensues  Daddy comes in and presses the 'go to sleep button'  stir as we leave the room and crawl towards the door, yup, you guessed it -- shrieking!  Daddy puts her back on her floor bed, falls asleep.   We tried sleep training, but her monumental levels of separation anxiety won't allow her to sleep. I am so tired of listening to an exorcism being performed three times a day. Let's not forget waking 3-4 times a night just SCREAMING. Like, no build up, no warning, just sudden burst of shrieking at 4am. The worst part is, we did have her effectively sleep trained around 6 months. However, an international move, developmental milestones have caused regression after regression and now we are back to where we started.  Good thing she's cute. I do love her to bits, she's daddy's little girl, but good god is this ever frustrating. I know this is a phase and it will pass, but it is grinding me down.  Not looking for advice, just a place to rant and vent. Feel free to do so below as well. I just feel super lonely as my wife and I have moved to a new city and we don't have any friends. I'm working, but it's not consistent as I am only a substitute teacher. Our lives revolve around taking care of a little banshee who is perpetually unhappy these days. Sigh.

    "self_text": "My husband and I just moved into our newly built house about a week ago. We’ve slowly been getting little things here and there when we realize or remember that it’s something that’s going to be of use a lot like a can opener, kitchen utensils, toothbrush holder, small things like that. The same week we moved into our house our son got rsv from his daycare, so I’ve been home with him for 8 days now while he fully recovers from this terrible sickness. Today I woke up and decided that since my toddlers doing a lot better and I’ve finally made a list of all the little items we still need, that after breakfast we would get ready and head to the store. We live in a small town so the store I needed to go to was about 40 minutes away. On the way there my 2 year old fell asleep. He’s normally on a 1 nap schedule, but I let it slide and didn’t try to keep him awake since he’s been sick the last week…this ended up being a huge mistake on my part. We finally arrive at the store and he instantly tries to fight me on strapping him into the cart, but I know if I let him think it’s an option it’s going to cause problems the entire time we’re in the store. Shopping is already off to a rough start, my toddlers getting mad at me for not allowing him to touch stuff on the shelves. I’m trying my best to quickly grab what I need while also doing my best to patiently deal with his little episodes. I’m slowly getting burnt out trying to make sure I don’t forget anything and keep my toddler entertained and not disturb everyone else in the store as well. I finally get everything on my list and feel accomplished so I start heading to the check out area. The line was HUGE….I forgot it was a holiday and that everyone was out shopping today. I get instant anxiety knowing I’m going to have to wait in this line and continue juggling keeping my 2 year old calm. After the first 10 minutes he started getting antsy. I try putting him down on the ground to hold my hand or hold the cart and he tries running off immediately. I decide keeping him in the cart was going to be the best way to contain him. I can tell he’s tired and at this point probably a little hungry since it’s close to lunch time now. I’m already embarrassed because he’s being loud and people are staring and I know the only thing I can do it remain calm to try and keep my toddler from escalating. We wait for a half hour and at this point we’re almost to check out and I thought about putting my stuff all back and leaving but we have already waited this long and this store is not just up the road from me. As we’re almost to the cashiers my toddler starts hysterically crying. He’s now over tired and every little thing is upsetting him. Im giving him books. Im giving him my phone. Im trying to hold him and rock him. Nothing is soothing or satisfying him and now I’m on the verge of tears because everyone is staring and I know he’s being loud and annoying and there’s nothing I can do to stop this melt down. Just when I think I can’t fail as a mom anymore than I am, this old lady ahead of me in line turns around and asks me to try and keep my kid quiet because it’s stressing everyone else out. I didn’t even know what to say back. I just froze. I already knew I should have just left the store when my toddler started having melt downs. I knew that he was being loud and annoying and most likely stressing people out. I guess her verbally stating the obvious  just made me feel like the worst mother in that moment. Thankfully this kind soul of a women near by heard and put this old women in her place which gave me some relief to the situation, but I haven’t been able to calm myself down since this incident because I was so overwhelmed by so much at once. I just wanna know if anyone else has ever experienced this behavior in public with their children before and how they have dealt with it. I take my child out a lot and he has never acted out this bad and now I’m afraid to take him to another store ever",

    "self_text": "Hi, fellow parents! I had a realization the other day that I feel like things are kinda, sorta working after a decade of parenting (kids being 10,8, and 7 months -- 10 YO has special needs).  Here's what I've learned -- kinda, sorta:    Get the help you need. I say this especially to the moms. We get guilted a lot into taking on stuff that we shouldn't be taking on, and sparing our partners the labor. Including the emotional labor! Don't compromise on your mental health, your time, or your division of labor.   It's mostly about quality not quantity, but sometimes it's about both. Some things really matter to your kids, to your spouse, and to you. Make sure you can do those things. The other things? Meh. Usually.   Don't get too invested in your kids following in your footsteps or being like you.  And there's really nothing to be gained from discouraging them, unless you're talking about things that aren't in line with your ethics or are dangerous.   Talk about and support your ethics. Kids want to hear that stuff and to see you live up to them.   Generally speaking, kids don't need to \"grow up.\" Let them be kids as long as they want to. Build connection, support them, don't worry about when they get to watch older media or whatever. They'll get there, and they've got a lifetime to be there.   Sleep, exercise and nutrition matter, but it's not possible to arrange any of them perfectly. Keep that in mind.    So, that's it. What have you learned in your time as parents?",

I often feel very conflicted at how much of his life is dictated by a calendar, all of it so calculated and planned ahead. This is not the way I want it to be; I want to give him more freedom, more time to be out and about in the world. I want him to experience the thrill, excitement of being a kid in the world, without adults micromanaging his every move. I want him to learn the art of self-reliance and face challenges that this more autonomous approach will put up him up against. I know the risks involved and I accept them, but it seems I'm alone in wanting this for my child because when I ask his friends' parents how they feel, it turns out they are not comfortable letting the kids roam about the neighborhood by themselves. Aside from a neighborhood park about a mile from our home, which I do let him ride his bike to, often, we just don't live in a neighborhood where kids are playing freely. We don't have sidewalks, no greenbelt.  I really feel that our overtly cautious culture of contemporary child-rearing is producing highly anxious adults and it has direct ties to how little our children are able to enjoy aspects of autonomous play.  Looking for some insight/creative ideas on how I can more effectively integrate more autonomy into his daily life, but in a way that doesn't feel like it, too, is something to add to the calendar.",

My boyfriend rescued the chihuahua about 7 yrs ago from the pound & he’s very grumpy & mean to strangers he shits himself when he goes to the vet & tries to bite the vet we have to sedate him anytime he’s getting his nails cut or getting vaccines dental work literally everything he tries to bite strangers & guest if you try petting him not sure what that dog experienced prior to getting adopted but he basically only likes me & my bf he’s nice to about 5 family members & friends that he’s seen constantly but anyone else he’s ready to attack. The chihuahua loved laying on my belly when I was pregnant so I assumed hed grow to be besties with our baby but every time I put my son near the dog the chihuahua constantly growls at him. My 7 month old is now crawling all over the place & is obsessed with the dogs (I also have a Yorkie) the Yorkie doesn’t try to bite him he kinda just avoids the baby. Today the baby was crawling around my bedroom laying in the Yorkies bed then he notices the chihuahuas in his lil cave bed & goes straight to crawling to him I didn’t think the chihuahua would bite him but he growled & snapped at him as if he was going to bite him (he didn’t) but I’m just scared that one day he actually will & I know if he does bite the baby we’d have to put him down & I don’t want that. I see all kinds of babies & their pets cuddling & just looking like bestfriends & I want that for them so bad but my chihuahua is just so grumpy & mean does anyone have any suggestions?

She didn’t cut it but she said she acted like she was going to in order to show him what it’s like to have things you love get hurt. Wife handled it very well and said that’s not how we do things in our house and just because someone hurts us doesn’t mean we hurt them back. She also reminded her mom that he is 6 and believes that his stuffy is real and can feel things so that may have been pretty traumatic for him. MIL goes straight to the defense and starts yelling about how critical my wife his about her parenting and how she raised her just fine and she needs to stop trying to doing thing so different then how she was raised. At this point I want to take this out of my wife’s hands. This isn’t the first time they have had this fight i I am concerned that their history makes this a harder conversation then it needs to be. I don’t really see it as a conversation, it’s a confirmation that we have boundaries as does our child and you crossed one and that’s not okay. If you are refusing to accept it then you don’t get to have him on your own because we can’t trust you, so you will see him when you see us. Is this to far? Should I just let my wife handle it?   TL:DR Grandma took scissors and threatened to cut up 6 year olds “since birth” stuffy for throwing a plastic ornament. Wife told her not cool and grandma made it our fault for being critical of her. I want to get involved but don’t know if I should.",

    "self_text": "To give a run down, I have a son who is 9 and we have a neighbor with 3 kids, who are 8, 4-5ish and 1 year old. The 8 year old and my son are great friends they don’t see one another often (different schools) but when they do they are great together. The 4-5ish year old is a great kid too but comes over less often and shows up randomly. And it can be a hassle as I feel responsible for what he does and what he gets into with the age difference. To be honest their mother and I do not text or communicate when the kids want to play, they show up here (either together) or just that 8 year old to play only at my home. My son either goes to get the oldest or the oldest shows up randomly. Which has seemed to work.   Yesterday, the 8yr old came over unannounced to play, no issue they played all day.  Today, my son went to their house to get just the 8 year old and the two came back together to play outside as per usual in our yard. The 4-5 year old came shortly after unannounced walking by himself and I decided to send him and the 8 year old home as it was almost lunch time and I didn’t want them all inside my home (not that I need to say why) but I am studying for an exam. Here’s where it got tricky, the 8 yr old said to me, I’ll take my brother home can I come in. I made a split second decision, and I said sure. -go walk your brother home.  About an hour or so later, the 4-5ish year old shows up and tells his brother it’s time to go his mom wants him. Later I get a text from the mother stating;   “Hey how are you? I just wanted to ask how come 4-5ish was told to come home while the others stayed and eat? He told me that he was told he couldn’t eat and to come after they are done eating?”   I said;   “I am sorry, I realize now that was rude of me and probably should have sent them both home. I am studying for a really big exam that I have tomorrow and was worried with (4-5ish) age I wouldn’t be able to leave them unattended. Originally I ask 4-5 ish and 8 year old to both go home while (my son) ate and (my son) would come back to get them. 8 year old asked if he could stay and that he would just take 4-5 ish home. I am sorry if that caused trouble.”  She said;  “Well I teach my kids to be kind and share and think about the other person. It’s was very hurtful for my son to be told to go home while others eat, (8 year old) staying was very wrong of him , he should’ve come home with his young brother. And yes both of them should’ve been sent home. And it’s not trouble but I raised my kids different. I wouldn’t have done that even for a second. The fact he was told to come back after they ate. I can’t allow they around”  I said;   “You’re right, my bad, I should have sent them both home. I completely agree with you. I based my decision on talking with (8 year old) he thought it would be okay to be sent home, I made a split decision, as (8 year old) has been over here multiple times without (4-5ish) and I was not able to watch them all.   I also teach my son to share, be kind and think of others.   Again, they are always welcome and I will send them both home together if I am not able to watch them both together next time.”  She then said;  “I think they will be staying home from now on. Thanks though”   I ended with I am sorry you feel that way…   Am I in the wrong here? Mind you her and I don’t talk, we give random waves and she doesn’t ever have my son over there to play. Yes, I understand it was my bad for not just sending them both home. But is it wrong to send only one? (I have only one). I am also the youngest in my family and was sent home alllll the time. My parents always said “yeah you’re too young.”   I am hurt my son’s relationship is in jeopardy somehow for something I may have done. Help!",

I was holding a snow globe and maybe inspecting it for far too long and a very kind 70 year old german man tapped my shoulder and spoke to me about a few pictures that he likes and why and that these animals mate for life, and I added that crows do too. After a few minutes of talking he said that it was nice to speak to someone who was different, stable and that had their own opinions.  My mother found me talking to the man and after she admitted to mothering me, he shook her hand and gave her 2 boxes of chocolate and said you have raised a special kind of person and blessed me.  In my 32 years a life this has been the 3rd time I have truly felt complimented and seen and it really made my day.  Moms need to get out more. Thanks for allowing me to share",

    "self_text": "My son (17) said he really wants a new pc set up for Christmas I was looking around and they cost a lot of money around $1000-2000. I talked to my husband about it yesterday and his response was “just use the money from the joint account and get it for him.”   Our son doesn’t game that often in general though? He’s super busy on weekdays with school, work, sports, and studying the only time I’ve actually seen him play video games is on Saturdays if he doesn’t have practice or a game. I told my husband it might not be a great thing to give him if he isn’t going to use it that much but he said he “isn’t worried about it”.  Am I being unreasonable? I’m literally the only one who budgets between the two of us. I also think my husband is saying it’s alright because he feels bad he isn’t going to be home for Christmas so he wants the kids to get whatever they want.   EDIT : Thank you all for the feedback positive and negative. I talked to him about it tonight and told him we’d get it for him but we’d also like for him to use it for college. He’ll be majoring in business I think it’ll help him with the documents and homework he’ll have to do. When he starts working at my dads company he can use it whenever he WFH too. We have a 2nd son and he isn’t interested in anything besides his telescope we paid over $300 for it. If the setup ends up being 1,000 we’ll give our second son $700 for spending to even out the cost.",

He's a little on the younger side with a September birthday, and is an only child who was home for most of the pandemic except 5 months of Montessori right before JK. So he's probably not as well socialized as some of his peers. No issues with speech or cognition.  We've been getting almost weekly reports of him involved in and mostly instigating fights with others (not just one kid) at recess and then telling teachers that the other kid started it (not always true). He seems to escalate to hitting very quickly. At home he can sometimes be this way too - just gets frustrated not getting what he wants, or getting upset at one of us for some reason and resorting to violence/anger. He slams doors, stomps off angry going \"I'm not going to play with you ever again!\" then threatens violence \"I'm going to hit you!\" and then occasionally will hit us. We have always firmly laid down the rules that hitting is not okay.  We have tried timeouts, talking about how he would feel if someone hit him, reinforcing using his words instead of his hands. It doesn't seem to be sticking. Pediatrician not concerned that this is medical.   Any tips on how to encourage other nonviolent methods of conflict resolution for a 4 yo?",

She has football outfits so doesn’t need any more.   She’s super hard to buy for no one knows what to get her. Her Christmas list only says iPhone.

He watches some TV, which has been identified as appropriate by us (parents). For example: Disney's Winnie the Pooh, Number blocks (BBC), Blippi (although I'm not the biggest fan), and Duggie (BBC). We have developed clear communication so that he knows that he needs to turn it off, after 2 or 3 episodes. He gets about 30 minutes of TV a day at most. He does not meltdown when asked to turn off the TV.  He has never had access to a smart phone or tablet. I have always felt that once he does, there's no going back.  So, now is the time we are thinking about getting him a tablet. We have a long day flight (14 hours) coming up and we feel that a tablet would help keep his attention and help minimise any boredom on the plane, in addition to colouring and other activities. We also think it would be good to give him access to phonic apps and number apps for learning.  I am hesitant about having him be able to access the internet, but I think I could preload the tablet with appropriate videos and offline learning/gaming apps.   Any advice on the type of tablet and what to think about before giving it to him?  Many thanks in advance.",

My partner works 2 jobs so is unfortunately not able to help as much as we’d like. Between both jobs and getting sleep I’m the one caring for our little girl almost 24/7. It’s just how it is at the moment and that can’t be helped. He makes dinners, takes on feeds when he comes home, cleans the bottles. He does 110% when he can and I’m super grateful for it but it’s only a few hours and generally I use this time to get a shower or go to the store.   People mention ‘It takes a village’ but my village is just 1. I don’t have any friends, but I do have family in my partners side. My side is just my mom. We had a lot of visitors at the start but seems to have been just to see the baby. But since then there’s very little contact, and if there is a message it’s asking about the baby and replies quickly stop.   We have a party on Saturday and I’ve been looking forward to it (First night out since finding out I was pregnant in March this year) but now it looks like I won’t be able to go because we can’t get a sitter. It’s a family get together with my partners siblings and his parents are already minding his sisters children, both her children are under 2 and by baby is only 5 weeks with bad colic, it’d be too much for them to handle all 3.   I was hoping my mom would be able to babysit for the few hours but I’ve called her a few times over the last week to ask her but she hasn’t answered or replied to my messages.   I’ve encouraged my partner to go and I’ll stay home with the baby since it’s his siblings and sort of a Christmas party among at them and it’d be weird me going without him. He’s saying he won’t but that’s making me feel worse for some reason. (He does so much and I feel deserves a night out)   My baby has pretty bad colic so I understand people not wanting to sit for us and not wanting to visit because it’s tough to listen to and even try have a conversation with a screaming baby. It even prevents me going outside cause its very unpredictable when she starts and settling her is next to impossible.   I know it doesn’t last forever and it will pass but it’s very tough while you’re in it. Everyday is the same yet somehow different.

Rose has been asking for not the characters costumes but actual wardrobes from the cultures specifically a sari, salwar kameez, salwar suit, kaftan, and the takchita. I would love to purchase my sweet child everything she desires but I also don't want to offend or upset people especially in a way that may result in her being insulted. Would any of these be acceptable and if not what's a good way to explain to her why not. I'm trying to teach her about the world and other cultures to expand her mind past just the USA. I am also trying to teach her about the Philippines where her father's mother is from but he is not proud of his mother's side and refuses to help teach her(we are not together). So I guess if anyone has ideas on that I'd appreciate that as well. Thank you for your time",

She did well for a few weeks and now it’s total hell. She has a great time in school and loves it when she settles down but the initial getting her in the door is borderline traumatic. This morning for example, she throws herself on the ground and I have to put her in the class and shut the door. She bangs and screams on the door begging for me while yelling at teachers to get away from her. It absolutely broke me. This happens almost every time. I feel like I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. If I withdraw her how will she be ready for next year when she has to be in school full time? We have tried everything. Carpool, dad taking her in, grandma taking her, walking her back to her class. Im at a loss and need advice. I don’t want to traumatize her when it comes to school, do we withdraw her and just try again when she’s more emotionally mature? Please any advice would help and please no hate. Thank you so much",

Most of these I didn’t even see until after they had passed away and the photo albums were then at my mum’s. My parents got a camera when I was about 4 but due to the need for film and developing, photos were generally reserved for events such as birthdays, parties, first day of school term etc so pictures of me growing up are scarce.  &#x200B;  Now however pretty much every phone has a camera on, plus a lot of people still have digital cameras so the opposite is true. A lot of kids grow up with their every move documented.  When my baby was born I bought a set of those milestone cards (eg “today I am 1 week old”, “today I smiled for the first time” etc) and due to always being busy or preoccupied I missed a few and stressed myself out about it so decided to ditch them. Early on I was taking loads of photos each day as I was worried that if I didn’t then we wouldn’t have anything to look back on. Most of the photos are literally duplicates.  How do you get the balance right of taking photos regularly enough to see progression, growth and capture memories but not end up with your child growing up thinking you look like a black rectangle with a flashing circle in it?",

Obviously being sick doesn’t have you feeling like your normal self but my baby girl is acting depressed & I’m concerned.

We encourage her to try using the foot but it's been very hard. We managed to get her to stomp both feet while sitting and that was fine.

The things he most often asks for, and is denied:   our phones/tablet (which we are very strict about, and give him almost never)  watching cartoons on TV (which we allow, but not whenever he wants)  more catchup (after licking the double serving of it, while he barely touched the food)   chocolate milk or cookies or something of the sorts (which we allow after a meal or between them, but not immediately before)   Listening him scream the whole day and worrying he'll damage his vocal cords or throat got me walking through that dark hallway of \"is something wrong with him\". We did have some tantrums with the 1st kid, but nothing as soul crushing as this. We occasionally have some good days with him, but lately those seem to be rare.

I have been doing the majority of the parenting for many years. But over the last year I have had the kids 100% of the time because she moved to a house over 4 hours away. She basically just opted to live her own life and not bother with the kids.  Initially she said she would parent them by zoom, but I spat the dummy so she was making the effort to drive up and see them every second weekend. Now even that has stopped. I work full time. My income is higher than hers, but I am still really struggling to get by financially with 2kids and a mortgage. The amount of Childsupport she has been calculated to have to pay is modest, but would make the difference between me stressing out, and being ok. Centrelink have contacted her employer and supposedly something is in the works. But it’s been months and nothing is forthcoming as of yet. It just makes me angry. It’s a huge stress getting by and I am watching my small amount of savings just go down and down.  Is there any recourse or avenue for help or justice that I can take? Perhaps I shouldn’t add this detail, but she identifies strongly as being an oppressed victim of the patriarchy. I just can’t stomach that sort of bs, given the actual circumstances.",

    "self_text": "Please do not come here to shame me and my parenting. I will just block anyone who does. I am trying to actually figure something out, not be judged.  90% of the baby stuff I have is secondhand from Craigslist. My father-in-law loves that site so he's always picking up whatever he can for us so we can save money. Very thoughtful! He even got our crib and two mattresses. One really bothers me on a textural level: it has a foam inside and an outside that feels like a plastic shower curtain. No matter what sheet I put on it, it is weirdly loud at all times. I despise this mattress, and it lives under the crib to keep my daughter from losing stuff under the bed by blocking access.  The other mattress is amazing! It is soft, made of memory foam, has springy bits inside, and feels like an actual mattress. It has an outer layer that zips around the memory foam, so I can easily put the outer layer in the laundry. It makes no plastic crinkle sounds because it isn't plastic.  Now that my younger daughter is getting ready for her own crib (we're moving in two weeks, gotta solve this by then) I wanted to get the same awesome real mattress for her. I was more than willing to buy a brand new one if it meant getting another one of these superior mattresses. Turns out, it was recalled 6 years ago so I can't buy it again.  I'm certainly not going to get rid of the one I have. The recall reason was that infants were falling between the edge of the crib and the mattress and getting stuck. Doesn't really apply to a 21 month-old toddler. So I'm not going to change her mattress for a safety reason that simply isn't applicable.  Looking at mattresses online, I just can't tell what ones do and do not have that plasticky outside. I can't deal with the plasticky outside. None of them seem remotely close to the Vyssa Vackert that I am in love with, but I accept that I can't have another one. Can anybody recommend a non-plasticky toddler mattress? Bonus points if I can unzip the outside and toss it in the wash.",

Since months, these have gone incompleted and have piled up in his school folder. During Thanksgiving break, figured wed have another go at it. By some miracle, he has accepted doing a very minimal amount, as an incentive for a privilege or reward. However, its still a struggle. Ive got horrible handwriting myself so my expectations are very low and realistic. I'm not expecting anything remotely perfect.I just ask for an honest attempt and some effort. Every session ends up in a fight over either refusal or inability to follow simple steps such as \"put the pencil point here, and go up this way\" and he puts the pencil point, but goes down the opposite way. I get so frustrated, and it becomes a battle of wits with no possible winners. I'm concerned that I'm turning him off from homework forever and I don't want t some repressed memory of dad losing his shit when doing letters and numbers jn prek being the reason that he struggles in high school or college. On the other hand, i know for a fact some of the other kids in his class are doing the work and i dont want him to fall behind because mom and dad just took the easy way out and avoided the homework struggle.  I've heard pros and cons that children that age shouldn't have homework in the first place, this isnt what its about. But the fact of the matter is that it is assigned by his school and other kids manage to complete it. Sure, I could make this a hill to die on and take the stance of developmentally he is better off doing X Y or Z. However, im having a hard time accepting that if other kids are mastering it currently, its just going to miraculously even out next year or the year after.   From what the teachers say, he is pretty much a model student in class but they have mentioned his handwriting skills need work, which is funny, because that was a constant theme for me and my older brother as children. Do i just lay down my weapons and accept that this is just a hereditary issue? As a 34 year old dude my handwriting is comparable to an elementary aged kid. Sometimes i cant even read it myself. If i wver get handwritten letters from my dad or brother such as birthday cards, i just guess and assume what is said..",

A little back story is we got into a pretty heated argument because she had simply stopped cleaning her room the way I like it cleaned and around the house after herself. I felt like I was walking on eggshells in my own home when she was around because we never knew what kind of mood she was going to be in and finally had enough of it. After we got into the argument she ended up moving out when I wasn’t home and we haven’t spoken much since then. It was almost as if she was looking for an excuse to leave because she knew I had rules she had to follow in my home. This has completely devastated me as she has always been my world. I know that she is being a typical growing lady but she has chosen to pretty much cut me off . I have reached out to her multiple time to come over or to go out for dinner but there is always an excuse as to why she can’t or simply no reply back. I only hear from her when she needs something from me and to be honest I’ve had just about enough of that as well. She couldn’t even text, call or answer me on holidays. Mother’s day hurt me the most. I felt like my heart was ripped out of my chest. I have always done everything for her but I feel like its time to give her tough love and just simply tell her Happy Birthday and do nothing more because I’m simply trying preserve my heart from the hurt of her rejection yet again.

The arrangement I have with their fathers is, the only time I expect any money from them is, for the yearly school uniform purchase, they often pay about a third of the total cost, and for school photos (I tend to buy the downloads so we can print as many as we would like) and as long as they have regular contact that is how it stays.   My soon to be ex husband, I have 2 children with him A(5M) and B(4M). When we split I assured him the arrangement I have with my girls fathers would be the same for him. Just help with the two largest expenses of the year, as long as their is regular and consistent contact.   It was an abusive relationship, and I have a restraining order which only allows him to contact me regarding the 2 children we share together.   Now he has basically stopped visitation, when I have reached out to arrange contact it is ignored.   School photos have come and I have sent him his part of the cost, I have also sent him the photos already. It's been roughly 3/4 weeks, since this with a promise every week of the money being transferred. Yet nothing.   So now I'm in the position where I'm thinking of going Child Maintenance and requesting support from him. I am in a financially stable situation so it's more this would seem to be the only way he would be taking responsibility for the two children he helped created and has assured me he wants to be in their lives.   B is additional needs and non-verbal so he does require extra help, support and extra items to reduce the stresses and sensory issues he experiences. Extra health professional appointments.   He has refused to have them overnight since we broke up and when he does have visitation it is one day a weekend, for 4-5 hours. Yes he does pick them up and then drop them back off. But that is it, I supply the nappies, wipes, the potty and extra underwear for B. Extra clothes for A in case of an accident etc. At times he has given them dinner but that's only when he picks them up at 1-2pm and has them till 6pmish.   So should I seek child maintenance from him? Or just leave it?   Which are your opinions on child maintenance?  ETA: I am not pushing for more contact. I am in talks with the appropriate people about whether to stop contact.",

He wants to get up and nothing can get him to lay back down. He takes nothing I say seriously. I’ve been nice. I’ve been stern. I’ve regrettably cried (twice). He will not stay in his room, let alone his bed. I really don’t know what to do and I know I haven’t been doing the right things.  I’ve taken toys away. I’ve threatened Christmas gifts away.

I have called the teacher, principal and social worker to make sure my daughter isn’t doing something she shouldn’t (i.e. hurting any one verbally or physically) and they say they have no knowledge of this nor have any children complained about her. My daughter is a horrible liar and she confesses everything to me, we have a very open relationship. I have been hesitant to bring the other parents in to this situation as the other two girls know that my daughter tells me everything and they will know if their parents find out it will be because I told on them and they will treat her worse.   Now my daughter is coming home saying that the one is threatening to kick her ass if she tells me stuff. And today she said they have a list of people they don’t like and want to kill. These girls are 10 and 11 years old. We are considering changing school for my daughter as she is entering middle school next year and will likely be moving to this new school (k-8) anyway.   But my dilemma is this… at what point should these threats from 10/11 year-olds be taken seriously? I don’t think they have any intention of doing anything but is this the beginning of really bad stuff? I know the one girl (first friend) is in therapy (same as my kids, I made the recommendation). Her parents are overwhelmed with siblings and their own parents who are failing, and I believe they aren’t seeing the signs. New kids mom has a new born and dad got a promotion at work. I know if I go to the school it will blow up, my kid will likely be retaliated against.",

    "self_text": "My ex-wife has been with her boyfriend for almost two years and I have yet to meet him. My daughter, who is approaching five years old, says that she does not have a bed at her mom's house.   She also says when mom's boyfriend stays over, she sleeps on the floor with a sleeping bag. When they stay at the boyfriend's house, she also sleeps with a sleeping bag.   I have half custody and when my daughter stays with me, she sleeps in her own bed with no issues.   Is sleeping on the floor with a sleeping bag a legitimate concern or am I overthinking this? Mom and I do not communicate so my daughter's well-being is a mystery.  My opinion about mom: she is the one who is having the harder time transitioning my daughter into her own bed because of her own feelings, and not taking into account what's best for the child. I totally understand it's ok to share a bed with a toddler, but if my daughter wants her own bed she should have it.   How could I get CPS to do a home check, if that's possible in this scenario?",

    "self_text": "Few weeks ago, I took my 2 yo to the playground on her new bike, she can ride it but gets tired or bored quickly I guess, she is still learning vocab, so she doesn't express her feelings efficiently.  So time to go home, 10 minutes walk, but she refused to leave, to wear her helmet, and to get on the bike. Went down on my knees to her level, used the usual techniques of soft talking and explaining calmly that we needed to get home because lunch time came, etc. None of that was any good, so I had to lift her in my arms, dragged the bike and walk home. That made her even madder. Walked for a while,when we got a little far from the playground, I put her on her feet and tried again reasoning with her to get her at least to walk, but failed again.  She was holding to some pole, and refusing to walk with me while screaming \"NO NO NO\". I was grabbing her hand and trying to get her to let it go, as gently as a parent can be in a public place. We were on the street, and was aware of what the situation looked like from other people's point of view. And soon enough a police car was passing by, I saw them slow down, and one of the officers was looking toward us. They drove away, but then made a U-turn and parked on the side of the road, facing my way. I panicked, grabbed my daughter and the bike, lucky for me I was in front of the building where my brother lives, and I knew the access code, so I got inside, I didn't look back to check if the police stayed or left, I was afraid it would make me more suspicious. (I am an immigrant in the country where I live, and there are a lot of bad stereotypes and prejudice around people who look like me) She calmed down when she recognized the place, and knew she was gonna meet her cousin (my brother's wife was not happy about this unannounced visit) but it was the only thing I thought of to avoid further problems.  So my question is: How do you deal with this kind of situations?  Some background about me: I grew up in a non-european/non-american country, and beating is a thing when children are misbehaving, even in public places, people may frown upon it, but it is seen as part of children's education and the efficient punishment for unruly children. I know it is not the right thing to do, and that's why I am not doing it, and will never do.  Sorry for bad english",

At End of the day, I turned out fine.  But I don’t talk to my dad as much  anymore, (he still says he loves  me , i say it back, and i truly mean it ) we have dinner once a week, and he teared up when he found out about the baby,  but  it’s awkward for me at times, i don’t know how to keep a conversation with him. I feel terrible about it.  I also find that I have better relationships with my friends daughters than their sons. Does all of this reflect on that relationship I have with my dad?

We’ve battled a tongue tie, had it revised, he’s struggled with reflux, a cows milk protein allergy, illnesses that regressed his eating habits, etc. He’s never been a huge fan of eating, and as hard as we tried he has not yet really taken to solids. He’ll eat teething crackers, cereal puffs, toast, and other little chip/cracker like toddler snacks, but everything else is purées. He has recently battled some bad bouts of being sick, the most recent of which landed him in the emergency room due to dehydration.  So we’re really not on track where we are supposed to be regarding eating habits. I’m starting to try and wean him off formula and more onto solid foods, but I’m so scared about him getting enough calories. His eating and nutrition have been a huge concern of mine since he was born and in the Nicu. His doctor hasn’t said his weight is too low, but he is in the <1st percentile in weight so I know it’s low, plus he tends to not eat and lose weight when he’s sick, which he’s been sick on and off for weeks at this point.   I guess my question is, any tips on getting him on solids while still making sure he eats enough? In the past, he’s gagged and thrown up when he eats anything with texture. He’s gotten much better at chewing and putting food in his mouth, but then some food he’s just not interested in. Any thoughts or advice is appreciated!!!",

We have two kids - 4 & 3 - and have always followed the OPOL method (one parent, one language) with me using the minority language (French, 90% of the time) and my husband using the language of the community (English).   The thing is, none of us actually have any connection to French. I have always been a \"language hobbyist\" and happened to spend the most time in France, so I do speak French fluently, but actually, my family is Latin American and speaks Spanish. It's a long, involved story about conflicted identities, some internalized racism, being caught between cultures, etc, but the short version is: although Spanish was the native language of my parents and extended family, we did not grow up speaking Spanish at home, and in fact, I resisted learning Spanish for a very long time and only learned as an adult. Now I do speak Spanish at a comfortable level (maybe like a CEFR B2, maaaaaybe C1 with some practice), but I think I still have a lot of weird inherited baggage and hangups with it, which was one of the reasons I decided to teach my kids French instead of Spanish. I just always felt more comfortable with French.  But now I'm feeling guilty about maybe depriving my kids of their heritage and the language of their ancestors and kind of wanting to teach them Spanish as well. Except I'm struggling to figure out how to do it. Should I start doing 1-2 days a week of speaking Spanish instead of French? How do parents suddenly start teaching their kids another language when they're already speaking one? I'm not really interested in doing flashcards for an hour a day or anything, that doesn't sound fun or very effective. We stay home now and plan to homeschool so face time isn't a problem.

    "self_text": "Hi, I’m a mother to a wonderful 9 month old boy. He slept through the night in his crib from around 4 months old to about 6.5 months old. At this time, he came down with a terrible cold and woke up often from coughing and often times he wouldn’t be able to fall asleep without a bottle. Then we moved when he was about 7 months old.   I think the combination of him waking up at night for a bottle plus the change in environment has made it difficult for him to sleep through the night/put himself back to sleep after waking up. The doctor said he 100% doesn’t need a bottle in the middle of the night based on what we feed him during the day.   How do we help him sleep through the night? I am 100% against cry it out. The doctor even said she wouldn’t suggest it based on his age.   Please help 😫  EDIT: I forgot the biggest part. My wife had covid recently and was gone for two weeks. During those two weeks, I let him sleep in the bed with me because I was afraid I wouldn’t hear him across the house if he cried. I think I got him into a bad habit of sleeping in our bed 😫 Normally people say to put them in the crib drowsy to help them fall asleep on their own, but I need to cuddle him in my bed or rock him to sleep first before I transfer him to the crib. Like if I put him in his crib drowsy, he will sit right up and start crying. I totally don’t mind rocking him to sleep at night. But… I don’t know what I’m asking for here. It’s the middle of the night wakings that are tough. Because we give him his bottle in our bed and then he ends up in our bed for the rest of the night.",

Something has been wrong since Friday night and he hasn't eaten anything since then. He spiked a fever of 104.2 on Sunday but I was able to bring it down with Tylenol. Still, Monday morning I took him to the Dr not really having many symptoms other than the fever, not eating, and behavior being off. The Dr tested for the flu and sent him on his way. He said he probably has a virus and as long as he is getting his fluids he should be fine that it is normal for kids not to eat while sick. Today he's been crying \"belly hurt\" an had a 101 fever. I gave him more Tylenol and called the Dr who doesn't seem concerned. Should I call another Dr? It's almost Wednesday and he still won't eat. I'm not a Dr so I'm trying to trust the professional but I just feel like this is not okay.",

My husband always feels like he needs to be taking the kids out to do things with them. As in /having to get out of the house.   I’m all for “doing stuff with kids” but to me that can be chilling at home painting rocks, making popcorn and watching a movie together etc   Husband always feels like we need to go to the park, swimming, sledding, any activity that’s not at home.   Maybe it’s just personality differences or difference in parenting styles?   I do have physical injury and chronic illness that prevents me from doing a lot of things I used to be able to do and maybe that’s why I’m less keen on these things.   Money is often a barrier, or circumstances like our car being in the shop or being sick. But my husband puts this pressure on me (at least that’s how it feels) by saying things like “we need to to do something with the kids, get them out of the house” and idk if it’s just my /perception of how things are due to my illness and feeling guilty about how little I can do physically. Or if it’s a genuine pressure he puts on me passive aggressively?   Do you parents feel like it’s necessary to always be going on outings with your kids to spend time with them? Am I just missing something here?",

    "self_text": "Hello! So my 7 year old daughter is absolutely addicted to anything with sugar. To the point she has stolen candy from cousins while visiting, and sneaks into anything i buy that’s even remotely sweet. First we stopped buying sugary type foods like cereals full of sugar and don’t keep stuff like ice cream or popsicles, chocolate chips etc in the house. But then we catch her doing stuff like drenching her strawberries in sugar, only eating waffles with butter and powdered sugar. I personally have tried not to focus on it in a negative way and just try to redirect eating healthier. My husband is very gung ho about it though. Freaks out nearly every time, and does tend to blame me if i wasn’t “watching” her when it happened. (Context, i work from home and there’s usually a few hours each week my kids are mostly unsupervised while i am up in my office working. She’s 7 so I see no issue with allowing her to make herself foods so long as i make her clean it up. And there is no way for me to literally hover over her with my job which requires phone calls with clients throughout my shift.)  Looking for advice on getting her sugar addiction under control.   Here are some other important details: My mom watches my kids most days. She keeps things like suckers and other candys and sweets in the house. We have tried multiple times to get her to stop as we feel it’s exasperating the addiction. We cannot keep daughter home as the bus only runs in my moms neighborhood for school, because we chose that school and had her switched to it, and my work will not allow me to leave to drop off and pick her up.  My husband has put a very strict grocery halt on almost everything sweet but I’m wondering if this is making her want these things more? I have her free range on her Halloween candy when she got it. My only rule was eat breakfast first, no candy after teeth have been brushed at night. She blew through it quickly.  We also allow 1 chocolate milk per day. That’s her favorite drink and we feel offering her a sugar drink she loves instead of making everything off limits might help her feel less restricted. Not sure if this is the right move to make?  Any advice short of keeping my kids from visiting my mother? Any advice on how to approach it in a way that doesn’t harm her relationship with foods going forward?  Just any advice at all will help! My husband is worrying nonstop our kid will get diabetes  and I’m just at a loss with her.",

    "self_text": "So my ex and I are trying to do damage control. I don't like my ex's sense of humor, he likes to insult people and for some reason most people find it hilarious. He definitely tones down his sense of humor and is careful what he says in front of our daughter but it wasn't enough. My seven year old hurts feelings with her jokes. Jokes she has 100% learned from watching her father's behavior. An example would be that we were at a first birthday party and my daughter called the baby a \"thing\" and \"it\". These are jokes my ex uses all the time. She 100% thought she was being funny but she doesn't know how to read the room and no one was laughing. She kept making fun of the one year old for not knowing how to talk and not knowing how to read. Her logic being that, of course a baby can't talk or read, so she thinks she's being funny pretending she's surprised the baby can't read but she doesn't realize it's insulting.   I constantly corrected my daughter. When she said it or thing I told her that was rude, she's a baby and she's a little human and not an \"it\". When my daughter made fun of the baby for not knowing how to talk or read I told my daughter that she couldn't talk at that age and she just learned how to read a few years ago. I suggested she read the book to the baby but she brushed it off and acted uninterested.   I had a discussion with my ex about him being careful what he says around her. He told me that he realized it was a problem months ago and has already made efforts to \"be better\" (his words). He also is going to try to talk to her about it not being funny and that it could hurt feelings. She 100% looks up to him and listens more to what he says than what I say.  I've made a mistake before correcting my daughter's humor. I told her it wasn't funny and that I know that she is copying her dad but I don't think it was funny. But she got upset and said \"You don't think my dad is funny?!\" So I don't know what other efforts I can do in the mean time while we try to correct this. I know it won't be an overnight fix but a process. And I would gladly take any advice moving forward.",

I understand babies can be a challenge for their parents, with my first I had a traumatic birth and PPD... but he is a wonderful toddler. Minimum tantrums, eats what I put in front of him, plays nicely, goes to bed willingly, he's affection and funny, he is such a bloody good boy and I am proud of him every day.  My PP experience with number 2 has been exceptional, I had a rough couple weeks healing from my elective C section, but beyond that my mobility is back, my mood is fabulous and aside from being softer round the middle my body is mostly back to where it was pre baby number 2. And she is a delight. She sleeps well, eats well, is quick to smile, doesn't cry a whole ton, she is beautiful. I feel lucky every day.   My partner, he works away but he is 100% a team player when he is home. He jumps right in to housework and parenting without skipping a beat. He is sweet, and affectionate and makes me feel fucking wonderful.  But if someone asks about them, I feel guilty, like I can't talk about them, because I arent suffering in motherhood like I should be. And frankly it's not well recieved, whether I mention it or not. So why can't we just lean in to the ease? Why can't we enjoy it?  And tell me about your unicorn babies, tell me your stories of them adjusting like champs, winning that transition, surprising you with their ease. I want all your good stories.",

Up until a few weeks ago, for the most part he has always eaten what we've given him (we did mostly BLW and some purees, and he took to it very well).

I don't want to give in and just give him what he wants, as I feel that will lead to bad habits later. Obviously lacking from his food preferences are vegetables and protein. I have a nephew who literally only eats fruit, jam, toast, cheese, and french fries. I really want to avoid that at all costs. I understand my son is not always going to want to eat what I give him, but it's beginning to become a pattern. I've heard it gets worse if you let it continue and do nothing about it.

We have recently moved and my daughter (12) made fast friends with a girl (13) at her summer camp, which was a relief because that's what we were hoping for when we signed her up, obviously. However, it quickly became pretty apparent that her new friend has some behavioral issues.  She was immediately jealous of any other new friend my kid made,  and in fact my daughter didn't really make other friends until this girl left camp for a few weeks on vacation.  When she came back my daughter described her having a total meltdown upon finding out it was my kids last week in camp,  to the point where she was hyperventilating and screaming and had to go to the camp director's office where they called her mom to pick her up.  The next week on my daughter's first day not having camp, we get a call in the morning from her friends mom saying that her kid was having a meltdown and could mine come to the phone and talk to her. We say no, sorry, she's sleeping. It felt very off to me for a parent to call a 12 year old to help calm an emotional meltdown. They ended up in the same school and have hung out a few times, but this mom seems to want to rely on my daughter as a therapist of some sort. We've recieved several texts along the same lines of \"my kid had/is having a meltdown for x reason,  had to leave school today,  can your kid come hang out?\"  I understand that friends help each other and talk about difficult things with each other but I also feel like it's inappropriate to request that a child fix a meltdown that adults are obviously having trouble handling. My daughter says that her friend has autism and an anxiety disorder among a host of other things,  and I'm kinda just blown away that this mom doesn't have any other methods figured out yet to help her daughter other than asking another kid to handle it. I know I can't really discourage this friendship, but I don't want my daughter sucked in to feeling responsible for this girls well being.   Am I being too harsh about this? I dont really know how to respond to this lady so I just make up excuses about her being busy.  I'm glad this girl has found a friend in my daughter and I'm sure it's wonderful for her mom to see her acting like a happy teen when she's around her if that's not her normal thing but I really don't like the vibes from this.",

I find it helpful to make sure we can hear if he calls us and/or is safe in his room. Husband wants nothing to do with it and feels that if he needs us he will come find us and that’s it.  While I generally agree, that’s not always true!  I’m curious at what age did y’all get rid of the monitor?  Do you use it daily? Or just sometimes (e.g. if u are solo parenting and need to be in the bathroom or on another area Of the house your kid can’t get to, etc)?",

    "self_text": "I am absolutely at my limit with my 3.5yo and the pooping drama. She has historically only pooped once a week since she was a newborn between her food allergies, subsequent constipation, and low intake. We went through a horrific battle with constipation that was literally causing tears to her rectum and it led to hours long screaming/crying/sweating/panting with her just trying to go. We FINALLY got that handled between OTC stool softeners and prescription stimulant laxatives … and now she just won’t go. Straight up refuses. I know she  can  because she did all summer. We had a blissful 4ish months where pooping was no longer an issue, no constipation, no pain, no drama. But now she is just flat out refusing to poop. I thought she was constipated again but nope, when she finally went, it was peanut butter consistency and no hard bits.   I have tried sticker charts, letting her have the tablet on the toilet, reading, singing, prizes, candy, bribing with special treats, at my absolute wits end the last two days I even told her if she didn’t go we would go to the doctor and they would give her medicine. Probably not the wisest move to threaten, but holy shit. I don’t know what else to do. At my mom’s last night I finally put her in a pull-up as a last resort and she finally pooped, but not without a fight. Even offering a pull-up or diaper doesn’t help and is met with resistance. Plus, I don’t want to confuse her because she’s been potty trained for so long. She also doesn’t want to use pull-ups and was offended when I offered.   What. Do. I. Do. This can’t be normal but the pediatrician keeps saying “some kids do this.” I get that to some extent, but this month she pooped on 11/6, 11/15, and then last night, 11/24. That’s not fucking okay. I don’t know what else to do and I’m desperate. Someone help 😫😭",

He has her two nights a week and picks her up for his time and i pick her back up at my time. Its what works for us because of his work schedule. Well lately he is constantly late to pickup knowing we scheduled it for a specific time because i have appointments, her sleep schedule, or other plans. Im at the point where i have no clue what to do as today he is 3 hours late to pickup. I just don’t know what to do anymore because he gets angry at me if i ask him where he is. I have no clue how to handle it at this point because he already schedules his time where he has her for as little time as possible within the two over night rules. For example he will pick her up between 4pm and 8pm on days he dosnt work then the next day give her to me around 9 until 4:30 for work (instead of taking her on Saturday and Sundays when he has days off) and then make me pick her up around 9am. In my state child support is based on over nights and its absolutely exhausting constantly having her durring his time. Any advice is welcome and needed at this point",

    "self_text": "My daughter’s 6th birthday is today. As soon as I woke up I said happy birthday to her. But when my husband came up to hug her and said happy birthday, she said I forgot to say happy birthday. I thought, ok maybe she forgot I said it so I told her I said happy birthday so she wouldn’t think I forgot. She gets overly excited about things to the point that she gets forgetful so this made sense. She also tends to accidentally hurt herself when she’s excited. She tripped and fell while she was getting ready for school, so I told her to calm down and she continued to talk about all the things she wants to do for her birthday. I was getting her lunch ready and I reminded her that we have a rule in the morning that we only think about getting ready for school because otherwise we both get distracted and end up getting to school late. Of course, I did what I could to make her happy for her birthday. I was planning on having everything ready after school. A cake is being delivered later today, and we are opening some presents from her grandparents and taking her out for dinner. She also has a party this weekend. I made sure a pretty dress would be ready for her to wear today to school like she wanted. I told her we would do something she’s been wanting to do after school. Then she went on about how I could have made her a card and then I stopped her because I was about to lose it. I said we have done a lot already and she should be happy with what she has. I didn’t raise my voice. I just told her sternly. She started crying so i hugged her and told her I wasn’t trying to make her upset. She said I spoiled her birthday. I went on to write her a card for her before school and told her I wasn’t trying to spoil it for her. I just wanted her to calm down before school because school is for learning and I didn’t want her friends to get jealous because they have said before that she brags or gets too loud sometimes. I don’t know how to explain these things to her without her crying. Am I being too hard on her? I am honestly afraid of her being overly excited about things because she probably has ADHD and I don’t want her to get too wild at school. I don’t want to hurt her feelings or make her feel bad about herself but every time I try to explain things to her, she takes it personally.",

The problem with this, is that my youngest doesn't sleep through the night yet, so if I leave to go to the gym she might wake up, and stay up until I can come home. This obviously interrupts my husbands sleep and he gets really annoyed. He does work really late hours a couple months out of the year, so I understand him needing extra sleep.   I guess I'm just looking for outside suggestions on how we can make this work so that my youngest doesn't have to come to the gym with me every day.  Thank you!",

I want to go home, maybe do some laundry and clean the kitchen. However there's also no pressing reason to leave. Laundry could wait till the evening, kitchen isn't that messy. I feel guilty telling him it's time to go home when there isn't any legit reason other than mom is tired.   So we end up staying 5 hours, get home and child is begging me to play with him. I'm a bit grumpy, want to get a start on the chores since dinner is in 45 minutes while also just wanting 20 minutes to sit down and and relax myself.  And it's not like \"we spent all day doing your thing at the park, now you need to give me some adult time\" logic works on a 3 year old   Similar situation in the bath.

    "self_text": "Our recently turned 11 month old has been giving us a hard time at bedtime for what seems like about a month now. I will give her bottled milk, wait until she knocks out, then place her in her crib. Usually this results in a quick alligator rollover to crawling to the crib bars and standing up.  Sometimes when she rolls over I immediately pay her back and it works… until the floor creeks on my way tippy toeing out or until 30 min later.   When she does wake up, it’s not like she’s whining in bed where she finds her pacifier and goes back to sleep. It’s always screaming while standing up holding on to the crib. Sometimes we wait a min but it’s nonstop scream crying. We used to cosleep anywhere from 4-5am until she woke up at 9:30, but recently I’ve been cosleeping with her starting earlier and earlier, leading to today at 11pm. She will sleep fine next to me. Toss and turn for a while, some nursing, and she’s good.  Im thinking it’s separation anxiety?? But how can I ease this feeling for her? When she wakes she crawls to the corner of the crib where you can see the doorway and then stand up, so looks like she’s looking for us. Also teething?? I saw a white area next to one of her existing teeth but it hasn’t broken skin yet. And I saw that today, so not sure if that explains the most the long behavior.  I’m not into CIO and don’t think I would consider it, so what are my options here? Some more details: crib is still in our bedroom, she wakes up at 930am with 1 nap at 1 or 2 pm. Nap usually lasts 1-2 hours",

Backstory: Ever since my son could talk I made sure he was able to use proper terms for his body. I have worked with vulnerable children/adults for years and met Case workers who talked about how important it was that children and developmentally delayed/disabled people know the words for human anatomy (butt/bottom, penis, vagina, breasts etc.) Too often they have children that are taught terms like \"hot dog/hamburger, cookie, biscuits, and tutu etc.\" Doing that has made it hard for them to get help when they say \"Someone touched my cookie\" or courts dismiss cases. Using proper terminology also can potentially scare away predators so I made sure he knows it all very well.  So the thing is at his school they apparently don't say \"butt or bottom\" they use the word biscuits, I don't know if they do this with other anatomy as well. I can understand if a child is just going around saying butts at inappropriate times being an issue, my hang up is I don't want him to start using biscuits and undo the proper terms.   Am I over thinking this?? making a mountain or of a mole hill? I was mulling over mentioning my feelings on all this during the conference with his teacher and just explaining at the end why I feel it's important to use the right terminology. I don't want to cause any bad blood or make them feel a type of way. So what are your thoughts as a parent?",

I honesty did not think everyone would attend. The venue has rhe number capped at 20 kids. I invited 30 kids...They're all coming.   So. What do I do?? I called the venue already and begged them to accept more kids. Offered them more money. Said i would stay to set up, clean up, whatever they needed. They said sorry no.   This is totally my fault. I realize that. I should not have invited so many. But I can't not invite the entire class, he's only 4. Is my only option to tell kids not to come????  Edit Ok so I called the venue and all their party rooms are booked. But they do have an open area where parents typically sit while kids play. They said we could use that space instead. But we would need to set up our own tables and chairs. The space will fit everyone.   Even though we are not using the room anymore, we still have to pay for that since it is past their cancelation time. And pay to use that open space. I dont even want to say what the cost was estimated to be. It's insane.   But we can fit everyone abd that's the important part.  Edit  Everyone showed up for the party that RSVP. And I'm grateful they were all able to come and celebrate with us. But we did have some families bring siblings along which I didn't anticipate. And I should have because I didn't have enough goodie bags for guests+siblings. One family came with both parents and 4 children when only 1 was invited. Anyways my total kids count was 36.

    "self_text": "Our daughter has always been a bubbly, outgoing, and happy little girl. She strikes up conversations with random adults and easily plays with any kids who are willing. Now she’s starting to have be negative about a LOT of things. We will talk about going outside to play and she’ll say “no that’s boring”, or recently we gave her a new pair of headphones that are supposed to light up and they didn’t work initially (there was a little tab on the battery we didn’t see) and her immediate response was “these stupid headphones are broken.”   Some other more concerning things are said when we tell her no for something. She will say things like “is it because you hate me?” Or “it’s because you don’t love me and I know it”. After reassuring her she will say “I think you’re lying to me”.   The first thought of course is to look at how we are as setting an example. We are very affectionate in our house with lots of hugs and cuddles. We talk daily about finding the good in everything and show calm in heated situations.  Additional context, she started kindergarten this year, she has a 3 year old sister, my wife and I have a great marriage, and we live a comfortable middle class lifestyle.   We’re afraid this is starting to get out of control and I’m hoping to get some advice how to navigate this and help her identify and work through negative emotions and tendencies in a positive way.",

    "self_text": "My son just turned 14.  He loves food, and he eats more than he should, and he knows it.  He is not very active, he plays tennis 4 days a week and he walks about a mile home from school each day.   He knows he eats too much, but he doesn't stop.  I just found out that he spent almost $200 on Noom - some weight loss website - so I know it bothers him.  I am a very healthy person, as is my husband.  I work out every day, have run several marathons, etc.  I eat very well, but I dont shove it in his face. His habits/gluttony have been obvious since he was quite young.  He has no regard for others in the house, he will eat everything and leave nothing for others - just the empty box in the cupboard.  For example - I went to a wedding and my departing gift was a lovely box of chocolates.  He found them in my bathroom by my suitcase and ate them without even asking me.  This is common.  I admonish him, he just looks at me and shrugs, like he cant help himself.  I have tried to teach him good manners, as well as healthy habits, but he doesn't care.  Im really at a loss of how to handle anymore.  I am really sad that he may have a tough road ahead of him in life, also because he is extremely lazy.  He begged for a dog but will never walk her. He could easily drop about 40lbs.  He is a going to be tall, he is almost 5\"10' and probably 170? 180?  Husband is about 6\"4'.  I need some hard core advice.  I tried to ignore this over the years so as not give him an \"eating disorder.\" To not \"screw him up.\"  Well, I think he is screwed up.  He eats when he is bored, he eats too often, he even told me that he never is hungry, he just eats.  He has 2 younger sisters, and I they have a much better relationship with food.  Im worried as they have started hoarding/ hiding food from him.  How do I get through to him after already trying?  Get tough?  Appeal to his emotions?  So much of his personality is about privilege, obnoxiousness, pig headedness, stubbornness, \"he knows better than anyone.\"  If I want to do therapy/ counseling, is that a good idea? Im just so lost",

    "title": "Harsh Gym Teacher Allows Bullying",
    "self_text": "tl;dr: My niece is badly bullied over her weight and tormented by her gym teacher.  &#x200B;  I am a current guardian for my 13 year old niece. She is a very big child with health issues related to her weight. We recently started working with a nutritionist and a therapist to help turn her eating habits around and improve her physical and mental health. We have been sticking to the routine and recent weigh-ins have her down to 270 lbs. I'm very proud of her but unfortunately issues at school have dampened her spirits.  The other kids are mean to her. They call her names this one boy routinely mocks the way she walks. She is a sweet, shy girl who just wants to fit in and it breaks my heart. She's already been through so much. What's worse is some of the teachers do nothing. Its all fun and games to them. The worst is her gym teacher Mrs. P who doesn't seem to understand that having excess weight makes physical activity difficult. I have many issues with this teacher. One being my nieces gym clothes do not fit her comfortably and the teacher only allows them to wear clothes with the school logo on it. The response we've been given is 'too bad' more or less with no real solution. My niece has gotten in trouble for being late to roll call because she does not want to change into these clothes in front of her peers.  My niece came home crying because the gym teacher called her lazy for walking during the mile and practically forced her into running. Its ridiculous because at her weight she gets pain from running but the teacher doesn't care. She made a point of telling my niece how badly out of shape she is after she'd failed the push up and situp tests IN FRONT of other students. When other kids bully her, the teacher does nothing. The other kids  chanted a mean nickname at her as she was finishing the run and the teacher just stands there like its their right to mock her. Its infuriating. I want to report the teacher, but I don't know if this would do anything to help her in the long run. It makes me so sad and angry that kids can get away with calling her things like 'manatee' and the teacher is allowed to ignore it.  I know I may get judgment for it, but I've considered getting my niece excused from PE for medical reasons. We would substitute with more of the exercises she can comfortably do in clothes she can feel good in. I think this treatment is going both physically and mentally set back my niece's progress.  I told my husband this and while he is generally supportive, he seems to think I'm being soft and I should have her push through it. She already stress eats to the point of making herself sick on bad days (and yes its on healthy food we have around), and I see this just making things worse. Advice?  Edit: Thank you for al the advice. I am looking into alternative learning methods. My niece is a very bright girl with a strong aptitude for science and math. We actually bond over this because I am a research database programmer and I’m very impressed by how interested she is in my work. I’m looking into online hybrid schools. I work a hybrid job as of now so that might be the best option if I can get her into a smaller setting. I want her to be able to interact with other children and enjoy school. She does like to learn but other children are nasty and bullying has become a routine thing for her.  As much as I’d love to get the pe teacher in serious trouble and get my niece switched classes, I fear that she has already been established as a target by the other students at the jr high. I know from my own experience that it is very hard to shake nicknames. A fresh start with a smaller group of kids might be better.   I’m going to bring this up with the principal hopefully.",

Here’s what’s important to us: -Community: we don’t need to know anyone there but want to go some places where there are friendly people, community building opportunities, support for parents etc   -Child friendly: good public schools and plenty of activities /socialization opportunities for little kids   -Warm climate: after 6 years in the Midwest I really am hoping to move somewhere much milder climate wise. Like with a winter that ends in Feb vs May.   -Affordable: looking for an area where you can buy a decent home for under $400k or rent a 3br for under $2k  -Within an hour drive of a decent size airport   Really #1 - community + affordable - is my biggest thing. If we could move to NYC, where our best friends live, we would do so in a heartbeat, but we cannot afford it unless we were to cram our fam of 4 into a one bedroom apt which we are unwilling to do. So we want to find a place where there’s a warm and welcoming vibe, plenty of millennials with little kids , and lots of child frequently stuff to do etc.   If you live in a place like this… tell me about it!",

    "self_text": "My 1.5 year old boy has been displaying a preference for his dad for months now, but it's really ramped up in the last month or so, and I'm starting to feel quite dejected about it.  &#x200B;  When I go get him in the morning, the first thing out of his mouth is \"Pa! Pa!\" (which is what he calls his dad). When his dad leaves the room, he freaks out (which doesn't happen with me). When his dad tries to hand him off to me, he'll often say \"NO!\" and bury his face in dad's shoulder. He'll often toddle off from playing with me to go look for his dad.  &#x200B;  The really obvious reason for this is that my partner is a fulltime stay-at-home dad. However, I work 100% from home to support our family. That means I lock myself in a room with a computer during work hours, but I also come out for lunch and breaks throughout the day. My work doesn't properly start until 11am, so I have 3-4 hours of high-quality time with my kid every single morning. My partner also spends one weekend morning outside of the house rehearsing with a friend, which means I have at minimum a weekly half-day of exclusive mom-and-son time. AND I still start each and every day with a loooong breastfeeding session.  &#x200B;  All this to say, I may be the one who's working, but I'm definitely far from absent! When I'm not on the clock, we split tasks pretty evenly, so there's not just one person who always does bedtime/dinner/nappies/whatever.  &#x200B;  It feels like we SHOULD be close, goddammit. As he grows into himself, I love him so much my heart might explode, but it just doesn't seem reciprocal.  &#x200B;  Look: I know he's still very much a baby, and that he'll develop more complex relationships with each of us over time, and that it's extremely normal for toddlers to have strong parental preferences at this age. I promise I know. But I still feel wildly rejected, and it's starting to eat at my self-confidence, not to mention the relationships I have with both my partner and my boy.  &#x200B;  It feels like absolute dogshit when he doesn't want to be with me. Man, I GREW HIM INSIDE MY BODY.  &#x200B;  When I tell other people about this feeling, the reaction has been fairly universally, \" You're his mom, and no one else can be that for him. I'm sure it's all in your head \" -- which is entirely unhelpful. It is NOT in my head; my partner sees it too and had no idea how to help me not feel so shite about the whole thing.  &#x200B;  So parents: please tell me you've been here. Please tell me it gets better, and please tell me when that might happen.",

I’ve been trying to help him by having him go to therapy as well as letting him talk things out with me, but lately we’ve been talking about inpatient (psych ward) treatment, as he’s beginning to have trouble with things like sleeping and eating regularly  Either way, my husband woke up in the middle of the night on Saturday to use the bathroom, and when he walked past my son’s room to get to the bathroom, his door was open and he wasn’t there. He looked out the front window and his truck was gone. The kid wouldn’t answer his phone and his location was turned off. At this point, my husband woke me up. We went downstairs and found that our son had left a little note that basically said “Don’t worry. I’m safe. I'll be back”. We trusted him and waited, and he showed up at around 2pm that day. He went straight to his room and I didn’t see him leave it for the rest of the weekend. He did go to school this morning (he’s in high school) without anyone forcing him.   I’m struggling so badly with this. The last time I posted about one of my son’s issues I got flamed in the comments for not understanding his mental health and what to do. I personally do not deal with mental health issues and neither does my husband (even though his older sister was bipolar and passed when he was very young), so I am out of my element. I am lost on whether I should punish him, or offer him support, or try to get him in an inpatient treatment. I’ve said in previous posts that his therapist is aware of everything that’s going on and how bad things are, and to my knowledge the two of them are working on it. Any advice is appreciated. My husband and I have not spoken to him about it yet because we cannot decide what our stance is going to be.   Also, just to be clear, I am not using reddit as my only source of information. I’ve been talking to his therapist as well as several psychologist friends of mine, and I’ve been in contact with the mental health department of our local hospital. Just looking for some perspective and support from parents who have been there and done that. That is all.",

Ive not been myself at all. angry and snapping at the littlest thing. i can see she feels rejected by me. it seems like i cant handle her the way i used to. we indulged her too much, was too soft on boundaries and consequences. after baby nr 2 theres just no time or energy for that so i had to implement all kinds of boundaries all at the same time. not good. i know. at this point she is at least ok behaving, but she is no longer close to me at all. i have tried to say sorry and talk about what has happened between us but she does not want to.  &#x200B;  anyone care to share what you did in similar situation?",

She said it seems he has weakness in his arms and core, and that it’s possible that he might have a sensory processing issue due to the standing (he also likes taking off and eating his socks when we put them on, so they never stay on long). I’m a first time mom so this all is majorly stressing me out. It’s hard to see people around me with babies that are progressing normally while mine isn’t. It makes me worried that he won’t ever be able to catch up. I know this is far in the future but I’m worried he is going to have even more issues that will make life really hard for him. What if he can’t ever make friends?   Has anyone had a baby with a sensory processing issue and/or gross motor delays? How is your baby doing now? Should I be as anxious as I am?",

We keep ending up breastfeeding the little dude and bringing him into bed with us.   A few options, but so far no successes. Looking for encouragement, or a new path/idea.    Let him scream where he is - but this doesn’t really work because he’s standing and the covers are off  Wrestle him in the crib. This mostly results in continued crib wrestling.   Feed him and put him back in the crib. He’ll fall asleep for 20min, then cries until we take him to our bed  Bring him to the spare bedroom with the portable crib, and dad sleeps with him in the crib. This works sometimes, but hasn’t really pushed the wake up time back, and leads to a tired dad and not much else.    Ideas?  Thoughts?  Encouragement?",

I have 3 very young kids, and live in the same small town as my parents. My mom is young for a grandma and doesn’t work. My youngest is at home with me (self-employed, so no maternity leave) and I recently found myself without daycare for one of my other kids.   My mom told me to ask when I needed help, so I have a few times asked if she could watch the older one while a have a client meeting. The response is sometimes “so sorry, wish I could help but I can’t that day” (totally fine!). But what bothers me is the “I’ll make it work somehow” or “that’s a tough day for me but I’ll figure it out.” It’s never just a simple “yes.” So I feel shitty asking her, and I feel super shitty accepting the help when it’s prefaced with “I’ll make it work somehow.”  She will also frequently ask me how I’m holding up working with the baby and toddler at home, and if I answer honestly and say I’m stressed or tired, she just says “Yup! That’s motherhood!” And I feel like, then why are you asking?  Am I reading too much into this? I’m feeling very alone, unsupported and like I’m a burden. Or that I’m expecting too much from my mom and life in general.  In case you’re wondering for context, I do have childcare sorted but it’s not starting for another couple of months. I’m interviewing paid babysitters to help me cover the gap, I just don’t have it all lined up yet.",

    "self_text": "Ok so...this woman, let's call her K, and I had been friends when our daughters were about 3, and we hung out a lot and I thought she was pretty cool. Our girls love each other. One day we decided to meet my brother and his boyfriend at this local lake and go to the beach. We were planning on being there for at least 3-4 hours. Once we got there I opened a Truly and I could tell her attitude changed, and a few minutes later she was like \"I can't believe you would have a drink. I can't believe you would risk our children's lives like that\" I was blown away thinking...it's one hard seltzer, maybe two or three I would have had over the course of 3-4 hours. Am I crazy? After that I started to avoid hanging out with her because I figured we had different ways of thinking. Anyway a few years later we ended up hanging out again. We both now have sons, and the girls still love each other. She seemed ok now, the first time I visit she offers. Me. A Truly. I hesitantly took it, shes all \"if you're gonna be here for a little while like an hour it's fine to drive\" I'm like ok...cool? We get really close. We start having playdates once a week and talking about life and it really seems like shes a wonderful kind caring friend, although she does have a habit of talking about all her other friends (yes, I should have seen it coming) Months later she is visiting me at my house. I'm putting dishes away and I say something about how my two year old had gotten into the knife drawer so we had to move the knives high up. Minutes later her son says \"ow\" from the living room so I go out to see what's up, and my son has a mother flipping kitchen knife in his hand. I'm like WTF and grabbed it from him and I asked Ks kid if he's ok, I looked at his arm no blood or even a mark but I'm still like nooooooo no we don't do that bro. K comes in and snatched up her kid, won't say a word to me I am apologizing profusely...she doesn't say anything. Tells my two year old to say sorry and he's like...two so doesn't say anything. Her son says he wants to go back to playing with the train set but she grabs her other kid and just leaves. I was so confused. I'm like wtf am I not freaking out enough about this? He's two, I have no idea how he got the knife (sink maybe??) I took it from him and tried to explain it was wrong, I apologized a LOT, he kid wasn't actually wounded and wanted to keep playing...idk I was like is this really that big of a deal? I would have probably just been like oh that was scary let's keep a better eye on the kids and kept playing. Is that wrong? Anyway I texted her later saying I hope your boy is ok, I'm sorry again, I talked to my son about it to the extent that he could understand. She never replied. I have to add that we have a homeschool group we meet up with every Thursday so I'm feeling incredibly awkward going because she hasn't replied to me and she's one of those people who knows everyone and is like.. idk the \"leader\" just makes all the decisions for the group, is comfortable telling other kids off etc. So I'm uncomfortable going now bc idk what's going on. I get there and another mom, L, in the group ended up telling me that K called her, and some other moms, and told them my son attacked her son and that she saw my medications in my bathroom and was like do you know what methylphenidate is??! L was like ...um yeah that's for ADHD. And another medication I take. And told them not to come to my house. So this woman is reading my medications and telling other people I know about them and not to come to my house because of the medication I take and my psycho two year old. Idk am I the one thats in the wrong here? I'm so upset about this I really thought we were friends and I would never do this to a friend. And also, she's a Christian, a very loud christian. Like wears Jesus shirts and says oh my gosh and acts like she's this really great person. Idk I guess I'm just venting, everything is so awkward and uncomfortable now whenever we meet up for homeschool stuff.",

    "self_text": "Hi guys,  I recently started seeing someone else, 6 months into a divorce that I initiated with my wife of 12 years.  My girlfriend and I have had a disagreement that has lead her to walk away, and I'm trying to prevent this from happening again in the future, so I need to know if I'm the crazy one here.  My stbx and I raised 4 girls together, 9, 9, and 3, and my 15-year-old stepdaughter I've raised since she was 2.  But basically, the kids are REALLY spread out in age.  I initiated a divorce because of reasons that don't pertain to this story, so I'll leave it at that for now.  Bottom line is since a month into the divorce, my stbx and I are amicable, the bounds of the divorce are ours and agreed upon, and we're still friends.  In case I need to say it, we're not continuing to sleep together.  I found a place very nearby so that I could continue assisting her with the kids.  She still lives in the house we own together.  My stbx is going on a trip this Thursday and she'll be out of town until Sunday.  I don't know where, none of my business, I didn't ask.  It's my weekend with my kids, so I was just going to take them a few days early, but because it's still a weekday, all of them still need to be able to get to school and do their normal routine.   My stbx suggested  that I stay the night at \"our\" house Wednesday and Thursday night and I could just do their normal routine in the mornings. She's leaving early Thursday morning, 4am.  I'm still fresh in this my place, so I don't have sleeping space for all of the kids.  I have a couch and two beds, a queen and a twin (4 kids+me, does not math. And my kids aren't sleeping with me).  I'm -not- spending the night there Wednesday night for numerous reasons, most of which should obvious.  I'll wake up early Thursday morning, have my coffee, and be there for when she leaves.  I'll get the kids on their buses and then drop the 3-year-old off at day care, go home, work, and then pick them up in the afternoon.  Thursday night, while my stbx is gone, I planned on taking her up on the offer to spend the night and sleep -on the couch-, that way my kids' routines aren't disrupted.  Again, once they're up and shipped off, I plan on leaving to go home so I can work, and picking them up in the afternoon.  I then informed my new girlfriend of roughly two weeks of what was happening this weekend and she became incredibly defensive.  She has two kids of her own, and was in a less-than-amicable marriage where a court battle was fought, so I realize that the idea of co-parenting could be difficult for her.  I wondered if maybe I miscommunicated what was happening, so, I recommunicated it.  She called what I'm doing a massive red flag, and said she's not putting herself in a situation where she's, \"Dealing with this down the road,\"  and basically said she's not the girl for me.  Sounds like it doesn't have to do with the idea of co-parenting, but of the idea that I'm inciting confusion in my children by swapping with my stbx the first night, and spending the night at my old house.  I suppose she's insinuating that I should instead bring them to my house with the two beds and make them extremely uncomfortable, then wake them ALL up at 5:30 in the morning to go back to their house and get ready, to make sure they're not confused................. Which, I'm sorry, sounds extremely silly to me.  At this point, I'm completely dumbfounded.... I'm assisting in raising my children with not only the consent, but also the  recommendation  of my stbx and I'm being demonized for it.  I honestly do not see  anything  wrong with what we're doing, but I need to know for the future if I'm either being too nice or too friendly with my soon-to-be ex stbx.  I wouldn't judge a woman for working together with the father of her children to assist in their daily routines, but then again I wouldn't judge a woman for any of her decisions that don't involve me.  First off, please be kind in your responses.  I know we were only together for two weeks but I really thought we had something great going and I like her a lot, and I'm incredibly bummed about the rapid turn this took.  But I also  need  to know if I'm actually causing harm with \"confusion\" in my kids!  Seems silly... isn't it?  <3  &#x200B;  -Adam  Edit: Changed \"wife\" to \"stbx\" in most cases sense some people can't seem to handle it. XD  Edit 2: Because so many have made the comment about me \"not having beds for my kids.\"  1) I have beds enough for me and my 3 kids -currently- if I sleep on the couch, which I don't mind.  I wasn't expecting my stepdaughter, but I'll have her this weekend since I'm helping out stbx.  That puts us at \"awkward arrangements.\"  2) There's a LARGE bed with a trundle that I have for my kids where I was staying before this house, and I cannot move it alone, as it's as big as my car.  I'm getting it soon, but not this weekend. I need help!  And I moved into this house LAST WEEK. =D",

He has a girlfriend he focuses on and lots of other random distractions but he fails to complete assignments and prepare for tests. He says he learns best from interactive teachers and struggles with teachers who are dry or just dictate information. He can get A's, he's done it. Right now he is really inconsistent and making school matter to him has been a real challenge.  So I got an idea. I was going to play a game with him to teach him. And make it an interactive lesson. He likes basketball. So here's the game / lesson.  Shooting a basket and making it in represents doing something he loves. Vacation, fishing, being with his gf or friends. So he stands under the basket and its easy to make a shot.   I made two decks of cards. 5 in each. Black cards represent a success and he can move forward to the basket. Red cards moves you back. One deck has 4 black and one red. Easy to make a basket, because he worked at it and enjoys doing things he likes.   The other deck is mostly red. And he is now like 40 feet from the basket so he has a much harder time making a shot (doing things he likes).   From there I was going to go over habits and tactics to keep him under the basket. More importantly that he can keep himself under the basket.   Question is, is this a stupid idea?",

We were devastated to learn that they were recalled at some point in the last 5 years since we kept it all this time to use for our second that's now on the way.  Normally I would throw it out no questions asked but from what I'm seeing in the recall it's from parents using it improperly (not strapping the kid in). I'm not seeing anything on dangers with intended, proper use. I don't plan on not strapping the little one in (especially after the recall) but if used properly are there really high risks? I know anything can happen to anyone, anywhere at any time but I'm literally only seeing \"Infant fatalities have occurred in Rock ‘n Play Sleepers, after the infants rolled from their back to their stomach or side while unrestrained, or under other circumstances\".

I keep thinking she is somewhat abnormal? She is very active and physically ahead for her age so I'm thinking that could be it (walking at 10 months, now climbing on and off beds and stairs and couches at 13 months). It's been more difficult lately as where I live it is full winter with ice and snow and cold temps so our usual outside time has been cut back.  For example, I will try and stack blocks with her, and she will stack them twice, hit them down, and then run away to something else. I tried to read her a book just now, and all she wants to do is turn the pages quickly and then pushes the book away. I've tried super crazy pronunciation and pointing to things, asking her where something is, and she is interested for a moment but then usually flips the pages and then wiggles out of my arms to another toy/activity.   Another example could be during mealtime, she will sit in her highchair for 5-10min MAX (usually on the 5min side), gobble stuff down and then say \"done\" and scream and thrash until we let her out.   Normal? I am feeling pretty burnt out from the inability of her to chill lol.",

So baby girl is going on 7 weeks. When we first got home she slept in the bassinet no problem then we had to go back to the hospital day 5 under the bilirubin lights for 24 hours. (Maybe that’s why she slept so well…)  After that, it’s been so difficult to put her in a bassinet. She has to be dead asleep to place her and even then she’ll wake up 20 mins-1 hour. Maybe 1-2 times she’ll actually stay asleep for the 2-3 hour stretches?? No say when. I have to put her in a carrier, contact sleep, etc. On top of that she is a night animal. Her witching hour is from 11 pm to 3 am.   I’m all for safe sleep but the last few nights I’ve had to resort to co-sleeping to get 2-3 hour stretches at night. She loves sleeping in my progesterone stent he’s and feeling the warmth of my body. It’s such a double edged sword bc it’s cute/bonding but scares me shitless. Makes me nervous as hell but yet here I am. Im following the “7 safe rules of co-sleeping”. Hubs and I need some sort of sleep. My PPD and PPA are up there.  I literally keep trying to put her in the bassinet any moment I can but she’s stubborn as hell. I would say she’s there 15-20 times during the day, she’s there… only once I’ll resort to co sleeping if we have no choice in the wee hours of the morning.  I feel bad for my 19 mth toddler. He hates it when she cries bc I see him shut down and suck his thumb. Her lack of sleep also affecting how I can interact with him too… just limited. :(  Any other parents had deal with this?  How hard is it to move her into her own space down the road? Did your kid eventually get used to the bassinet?",

    "self_text": "My 14 month old has never been a great sleeper. He slept full through the night for a few weeks when he was 9-10 months maybe? Besides that he wakes up 1-2 times a night still. Which I know can be a parents dream compared to what others might be going through. We co sleep and although I’m grateful for me being a light sleeper, he is so restless at some parts of the night leading to a wake up and he’ll kick me repeatedly and groan. Still asleep groaning but it can last for up to 10 minutes and then it starts feeling like forever. I do give him (2 max) bottles with 4-6 oz of milk to get him back to sleep quickest for some sleep. I understand that this is more than likely a habit and not because he’s hungry as he eats well and snacks throughout the day. I’m not sure what method would be best to teach him self soothing and getting back to sleep. The groaning, if we let it go on enough, I notice it will taper off and he will eventually go back to sleep so maybe that’s a soothing technique?   The issue is, I’m the only one whose ever woken up with him and I’m always the one to put him to sleep. So frankly, I’m tired. We live 50/50 with my mom, younger sister, my husband (baby’s dad). Dad wakes up early for work yes but he doesn’t work weekends and I still do all the putting to sleep and waking up at night even on his days off.   If I try to let baby cry it out, for more than 10 ish minutes my husband will ask me to grab him and soothe him. Even after I’ve told him I’m trying CIO since I do all the sleep related things I should pick the method I want to try out. OR my mom will text me from her room asking me if I want her to take the baby and out him back to sleep (because he’s crying) or in the morning will tell me I was being mean to him because he was up crying “all night”   Mainly to vent, also need some advice, words of encouragement, and maybe some gentler sleep methods to try out? I’m happy to provide more info if needed, thanks!",

We are up most nights throughout the night. When she finally does go down, it’s usually only for 3-4 hours at a time and then she’s up and at em again. It’s been this way most of her life.

My wife does watch her a lot on weekends and will sometimes stay up with her during the week, so she’s definitely doing her part as well. My daughter also goes to school part time during the week.

We have been playing along as pacifier reinsertion specialists but the last few nights have been a kicker. After her first longish stretch (~4-5 hours), either I or my husband is up with her seemingly every 1.5 hours to either feed (every 3 hours) or replace binky, because she wakes up crying for it. I should mention the same thing happens for naps… she typically won’t sleep longer than 45 min at a time. However, she is a champ at going down “drowsy but awake.”  I’m not sure what to do. She is still swaddled so she can’t self soothe with hands or find a new binky in the crib (and honestly she’s not developmentally there yet anyway). I want to get rid of these pacis so she’ll stop waking up but I am absolutely terrified of the process of taking them away from her, and I like the SIDS protection.  Any advice?

    "self_text": "I was a single mom to my toddler until she was just under 2. Started dating my now-fiancé and he moved in 3 months ago. We disagree on parenting approaches. I have been trying the gentle parenting / respectful parenting approach, and he resorts to time outs. I also hate that he doesn’t validate her feelings, going so far as invalidating them (he’s an amazing parent otherwise, so so good with her! It’s just that he says “you’re not sad, there’s no need to cry”)  I have a new job so he’s stepped up in his parenting duties. Tonight he brought up stuff that has apparently been bothering him for awhile. He says that when it’s just him and her, my daughter doesn’t cry or act up. He then told me a bunch of things he thinks I’m doing wrong or ineffectively. So many mixed emotions going on right now…  I’m willing to try the strategies he suggested, but I felt attacked and am angry about the way he approached this. It feels as if he is saying he is the perfect parent, and he wants me to conform to his way of being. Maybe she doesn’t act up as much when it’s just them, but it’s also still a novelty for her, so of course she is on better behaviour. He is now taking that to mean that his way is right and mine is wrong.   Argh. This is the biggest ‘fight’ we’ve ever had. How do you all manage parenting disagreements? Any advice?",

If we stayed in his room until he fell asleep, he’d wake up crying when he realized we weren’t still there. He will not verbalize any reason for the change in behavior.  From infancy, there were NEVER any sleep problems. He always went to sleep easily and slept through the night (except waking him up to breastfeed).   Parent 1:  feels like the best long-term solution is to continue to calmly take turns returning the 3yo to his bed in the hopes that in a matter of days or weeks this phase will pass and things return to normal.    Parent 2:  feels that whatever the problem is, it won’t be solved by forcing him to remain in his room alone. This parent has started sleeping with him in his room in the meantime, although even then he still has trouble sleeping.  What do we do? We’re both at a loss as to what the problem is, what the solution is, and are both really tired.",

She had a beautiful Belle dress, with gloves, jewelry, and a crown. Took a bath before going so her pretty shirley temple like curls were perfect little ringlets. We started a little early since she's so young.   I was worried there wouldn't be many houses handing out candy. I was wrong. Tons of houses had lights on.   I was worried she'd go candy crazy. I was wrong. She was so polite. People would say grab a handful! And she'd gingerly pick one or maybe two candies. Half the time they'd laugh and give her a whole grown up sized handful. If there was just a bowl left out she'd only pick one candy.   I was worried we wouldn't see many other kids out (last year we couldn't go out and I also didn't have a single trick or treater come to my house either).  I was wrong. We actually ran into my neighbor, who happily invited us along, so my daughter had 3 friends to walk with, and I got to make better friends with my neighbor.   I was worried she wouldn't want to settle in for bed when we got home. I was wrong. I let her pick out a handful of candies to try, put the rest away for now with no argument. She asked to sleep in her dress, sure no big deal. And she fell asleep only a little later than normal.   I just wanted to make a happy vent. I'm so happy she had such a fun time. She's such a wonderful little angel, and I'm really lucky I get to see her grow and experience new things.",

However, she never said it and I know she wouldn’t around US, but now that someone in a respected position has just dropped the worst word in the English language, what is stopping her using it elsewhere? Obviously we educate her as much as we can, and as a family we are liberal with swearing, so us never saying a word means it’s totally off limits in general society.

I’m also not self diagnosing here or anything but personally feel like I have developed postpartum depression.   Baby is now 1 month old with what seems to be pretty bad colic. I thought it was just baby blues but it is getting more severe and lasting a bit too long to be baby blues. I haven’t felt the need to harm baby or anything. I do however find myself mentally and physically exhausted walking the house for hours on end in tears listening to her screaming despite trying everything to calm her (I’m making and appointment for her tomorrow along with mine to ensure it is colic) With aches and pains from delivery still there along with new ones (Hello back/neck pain).  Her cries kill me inside and I have found my outlook on parenthood and life in general very doom and gloom. Things like: I’m a terrible mother, my child doesn’t/wont love me, I’m a failure, I’m not cut out for this, everyone else just gets it why can’t I etc.  I find I’m getting irritated with my partner daily. Anyone who offers ‘support’ or diminishes my feelings I get very personally hurt by (Comments like ‘It doesn’t last forever’ ‘All babies get colic’ ‘Sleep when the baby sleeps’ etc.)   I’m severely hating visitors: 1. because I’m trying to establish a routine with baby and it’s proving to be extremely difficult. 2. So many people seem to think it’s okay to come over sick 3. Baby isn’t vaccinated yet 4. Very few are helpful and I find I’m entertaining them (Getting them tea/coffee, offering a snack) 5. I’m extremely sleep deprived and trying to hold a conversation is so hard  I think it’s just all getting overwhelming, my partner is amazing at offering support but does have 2 jobs. He also took the first 3 weeks off to help and it was really helpful but now he’s returned to work I’ve felt the strain.   I don’t know how postpartum is treated. I’m worried I’ll be hospitalised/committed and the idea of this terrifies me. Will I be reporter to CPS for having it, Will there be frequent house checks? I obviously haven’t harmed baby but I know this happens with PPD so is there a checklist they must follow? I’ve never been on medication for depression is it a one size fits all? Is there a weaning period?",

I didnt like X,Y,Z when I was growing up so now I'm trying not to let my daughters experience it, etc etc.  But omg. In the last 5 years the health of my husband's parents have changed our lives. My MIL moved in with us, and there was constant stress and strain and I mentally couldnt handle what it did to our family dynamic and just the feeling in the house (she was not a pleasant person when healthy, and this magnified when she was unwell) and we all went through SO MUCH because of all of that (children included, which added to my depression). And his dad got sick on top of it. And finally, FINALLY when we got her to a place where she was better and able to move out... my parents get sick.  Like literally this morning I woke up and for the first time in 5 years felt just... happy. Like nothing special happy. No excitement happy. Just basic, life is ok happy. It was SO NICE! And tonight my sister calls me sobbing because my mom fell and my dad needed my sister's help because he just had surgery to get a tumor out and has covid and my mom fell because she has a \"brain infection\"(?!?!) And we didnt know any of this because they're always \"fine\" when we ask and now my husband and I are considering moving them into my MIL's recently vacated room and.... you see what I mean?  And I know I'm not the only one. So many of my friends are going through the same thing. More than I can count on both hands. One of my friends even has a gofundme out because his LUNG COLLAPSED while he was taking his mother to the dr (who he has cared for for over a decade, btw) and is now in the ICU.   I told my husband in no uncertain terms will this EVER happen to my children. I will move somewhere where I can be put to sleep when I want to and I will never ever affect my daughters' mental health (or my grandchildren for that matter!) and financial stability.  Is this a new thing? I dont recall seeing this happening among my parents and their friends, but I see it so much now that I dont know how I wasn't prepared for this.  Just to be clear: I love my parents and I dont want them to die. But a little part of me knows that something mentally inside me will have to give eventually, and I'm terrified of when that will happen and how that will affect my girls and husband (and how it has already affected them).  Sorry for the rant. UGH.  TL/DR: I wont let my children deal with my \"unhealthy aging parents\" problem when it's my turn.",

    "self_text": "I've gotten 2 emails from 2 different teachers on my 14 year old son's behavior in class - its nothing crazy, just talking to friends, teacher overhearing him swearing, cell phone usage, etc...His science teacher said he was talking to his friends and help up class whole she was trying to explain something to the kids before they took a test. This caused the test to be delayed and they only had 17 minutes to finish...which he then complained about not having enough time.   Now his humanities teachers have said he's using his cell phone when he shouldnt be, talking to his friends, not following directions. He got sent to the \"planning room\" and lied to the teacher about why he was there. He said he was \"taking a break\" when he had been sent there because of his behavior. His teacher came and got him after a bit and he went back to class.  My son is smart and that might be part of the problem. He finds alot of classes boring and not important or \"worth it\". He really likes math. His grades are good, mostly As and 2 Bs because he was a slacker. He just doesnt value school and thinks its a waste of his time and he'd rather be socializing. My 17 year daughter is just the opposite of him - quiet in class, strives for all A+s (shes in National Honor Society and has a 4.33 GPA).  Anyways, any ideas on how to correct this behavior? I get these complaints about him every year.  Right now I plan on taking his phone away during the school day. I'll let him lock it in the car (my daughter drives them to/from school) if he can be good about doing that (i can check his location to be sure he is leaving it). If not I will make sure to take it away from him when I leave for work. I'm thinking I do that until Christmas and then maybe give him a chance to get it back? If it gets worse I can take his gaming PC away at a certain time each night (I can just cut the internet from it). or take it away altogether. I'm at a loss here since its not like I'm at school with him and can monitor him closely.",

She eats 3+ solid meals a day  Wife does not believe in sleep training   Has had less then 5x 9 hour stretches of sleep. On average she is up 2-10x a night.   Traditionally sleeps in crib but wife will bring her to our bed during very difficult nights.  She will not accept dad to even get her back to sleep and will just scream until mom comes in. This has been one of our only methods to be able to get her to sleep sometimes.   We just recently found out my wife is pregnant again and we have to start taking some bigger steps here so my wife can rest comfortably. I’m perfectly fine with letting her start to cry it out and ween off breast feeding but my wife is not. Recently my wife has been working towards no more night feeds and we started making progress and then time change and 1 year shots have just destroyed any progress and we’re struggling to get her back to sleeping at night.  Has anyone faced the same or similar situation? Are we just doomed and did this completely wrong? Any recommendations on a work into it sleep training that’s good for someone who doesn’t want to sleep train. Any help is greatly appreciated.",

Maybe confusion, if anything... \"Ok I will do this, but I can see Mama.\"  She goes to preschool. Will they make fun of her? Is there anything I can get for her that will help? Maybe one of those glasses necklaces that you see teachers wear all the time to keep them from falling?   What do I tell her? I say glasses are cool and they help you to see. But that just turns her back around to the 'but I can see, Mama!' she even said the same to the doctor when he told us that she needed glasses!

I bought him pink toys and make pink playdoh and slime... pink foods.   But a pink jacket... at school?   I was teased really bad in school. It started very young because I admitted to not believing in God. I was in elementary school and was constantly told I was going to hell and all that stuff and it carried all the way into high-school. It's not like I advertised it or anything it was this one time when I said I didn't believe in God. It's not like I bashed God or pushed my religion. I simply said I didn't believe in God and I was harassed probably until senior year.   There is no way I want my son to be teased or treated like crap because he likes pink.   I want to get it for him because I know he will be over the moon, but I don't want to because I don't want him to have to go through what I went through.   I asked him if other boys in his class wear pink? He said no, but if he gets teased his teacher will put a stop to it and he will just ignore them.   I know some parents teach their kids to be more accepting. I also know some parents teach the opposite.   What would you do reddit? Buy the jacket or no?  Edit: Thanks reddit. I bought both.",

When we moved his dad started smoking in the house again and idk if he smoked everywhere or just his room. My husband did get on to him tho because we still had our stuff there and his dad said he stoped after that.  The whole thing was we were supposed to move In with my mom. Her house is unrepairable. They are extreme hoarders and the house is so moldy you can smell the mold everywhere. It’s falling apart. They always say “oh we’re going to clean this weekend” never happens. I’ve given up at this point. The reason I’m mad is I have my bunnies and tortoise there because my grandma doesn’t want them at her house. I want to live with my animals. I love my animals so much. I go take care of them everyday and it makes me so depressed not being able to live with them.   I really am thinking of going back to my husbands dads house. I’m just paranoid. For one, the smoke. Is it even safe to live there with my son? I know I should scrub the walls but even after that is it safe? Also they live in a condo and I hate condo s because I’m always scared someone will start a fire and everyone’s screwed. Like you’re life is in other people hands basically.   Also want to add my husband has physical disabilities and can’t work but does plan to go back to work. I am in therapy working on my mental health to try to help me but I will push myself to get a job. We don’t plan to live with family forever.   I feel like living with my family traps me. Like I feel like I’m going no where in life. I don’t know how to explain it. Anything you ask my family to do they say they’ll do it and never do it. They have bad mental problems obviously with the way they live. I told them to get professional help with the house and they always say no they’re going to clean and they never clean.   My husband is a narcissist. He’s done so much. I’m trying so hard. I’m going to make a couples counseling appointment to help us.   I feel absolutely trapped and it makes me so depressed.

My wife is very strict and wants him to follow all rules. If he disagrees it leads to arguments and he talks back. We have tried taking things away that he values but it is not working. A few days later he once again becomes rude. My 10-year-old is also emulating the same behavior.  I grew up in another country where my mom was not strict but my dad was very strict. I was afraid of him. He physically beat me many times even when I did not do anything wrong and he was mistaken. This only happened to me as I was the firstborn. My younger brother was not beaten. This did not help my relationship with my father. I don't believe in physical punishment.  My wife is worn out by the rude behavior of my kids and wants me to bring the hammer down on the kids. I do talk with them and they listen. 13-year old says he is working on not talking back but he gets angry and cannot control his anger.   The arguments can be about screen time, putting lotion on face, how they are dressing up, who they play with etc   I hope I can learn about some effective strategies to discipline my kids without alienating them so they can come to us to share their problems.",

Our little one loves looking at clothing and was all over the place going from the women’s section to men’s to kids looking at everything. I followed his lead through the store while my husband continued shopping.   He loves anything with vehicles right now, and especially loves our cat! He picked out some car pyjamas and a train shirt in the boys section then ran through the girls section and stopped in front of a purple shirt with a white cat on it (Marie from the Aristocats). His face lit up and I asked him if he liked the white cat on the purple shirt. He did and so I got it along with the other clothes he picked out.   When my partner saw the shirt he got upset because it was a “girls” shirt. I tried to explain that I don’t see it that way and what matters to me is that our LO is happy. I don’t want to impose gender roles on a 2yo who has barely an understanding of the difference between boys and girls yet, let alone tell him he can’t have something or shouldn’t like something because it was made for girls and not him. He likes cats and he saw a cat, that’s it. Why do adults have to make it more complicated than that?   I tried to have a conversation and figure out why my husband had such strong feelings against the shirt but he wasn’t really open to talking about it. Maybe he doesn’t know why exactly. We did grow up in a different time where my husband would not have been allowed the same freedom of expression. And also in a rougher neighbourhood where it wouldn’t have been safe to wear any clothing you wanted, even certain colours. I’m still unsure if he was upset because he thinks LO won’t wear it and it was a waste of money - he mostly only wants to wear clothes with vehicles lately so that concern does have some validity. Or if it was because it was made for girls. Or both.   How do I renter this conversation? I don’t think I was wrong for buying it. If my child likes something I don’t feel right limiting him based on our society’s need to assign everything to a specific gender. He also picked up sparkly pink sneakers and put them back so I can only imagine my husbands reaction if he had chosen those! 🤣",

My son who I have had evaluated in the past once when he was 2 y/o and not talking and diagnosed with a speech delay which he got therapy for up until COVID and now he talks great! So that’s good and then when he was 4 y/o and he was diagnosed with a sensory processing disorder but was told it was mild and we were told through coregulation he will be fine! Well I am here to tell you he is not fine. He is now 6 y/o and we struggle with coping, and tantrums and aggression and all the fun things.. nothing serious but enough to disrupt his learning in school and to function in other avenues without some kind of catastrophic meltdown. We’ve mostly stopped even doing outings a lot of the time because it turns into a giant catastrophe and family events are also hard. Anywho, I come to you today because I need help with some potty time stuff. Now mind you despite all his hang ups he potty trained extremely fast and well and never had to wear diapers at night and never wet the bed! He was 3y/o when he was fully potty trained. However… we have no regressed and for the last year he will refuse to poop on the toilet 8 times out of 10 instead he will wait to have an accident and then one of us has to clean him or he will just go in the shower or bath. Refuses to wipe most of the time.. and we have been trying everything. Times reminders.. sitting for a few minutes, rewards punishments everything! He LOVES Minecraft and is insanely good at it and it’s his biggest motivator for everything even his teacher told us to use it as a motivator for school work and it has worked great… but not for potty time.. in fact now when he has accidents because he knows he will lose the mine craft for the day he has started hiding his soiled underwear and it’s not just poop anymore it’s pee too.. he hides them in the back of his closet… not sure how long he’s been doing this I only discovered the first stash about 2 months ago and we had a talk about it and I hadn’t seen a stash again until today and I’d been checking… but today there was about 8 pairs hidden some of them SOAKING wet… I don’t even know what to do at this point. It’s literally brought me to tears because I feel like it’s a bigger issue than just having accidents but he won’t talk to us about it… I also feel horrible for the times I’ve lost my cool or his dad has lost his cool because of an accident.. because clearly there is something wrong and we don’t know how to help!

We live in a country where we are privileged enough to be able to hire a nanny to care for our toddler (2.5 years). Last week, our nanny suddenly stopped showing up and we were  suddenly thrust into caring for our toddler full time + working full time. Prior to this, our child rarely watched tv but we became heavily dependant on it the past week out of desperation in order to be able to work. She has toys but when she has no one to play with, she quickly starts depending on us for entertainment or cries and whines a lot + trying to climb on us while we're on our laptops. Aside from the TV, we take turns taking her outside for a walk and reading/playing for some time. She also has a pair of headphones and we sometimes will let her listen to music/read-alouds on our phones but she quickly gets tired of this.  However, we have really enjoyed our family time, spending every day together (just the 3 of us). I worked from my office yesterday and took my daughter with me. My colleagues loved meeting her and it was a nice break of monotony from staying at the house.   We're interviewing around for a new nanny but we're also considering keeping it like this for some time. Maybe until next year... maybe longer!   So I'd like to know how you guys manage to do it! We definitely would like to keep her off the screens but also out of mischief! How do we help her learn to play independently? Would it help to create a set schedule excluding screentime? Do we need to set up lots of out of home activities? Play dates?  FYI - screen time consists mostly of Super Sema, Jojo & Gran Gran and Octonauts  ETA: we both work very flexible jobs",

Every night we put him down and he goes to sleep for about an hour or two, and then every night, like clockwork (as we’re watching a movie or whatever) he wakes up crying and we have to go in to the room 2, 3, 4 times to try to get him back to sleep. And in the middle of the night he wakes up multiple times to breastfeed and get in the bed. At most, he will sleep 4 hours at a time, but even then it’s rare. And he’ll be up for anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours. It’s bad. I realize that a lot of this is our fault for nursing him to sleep, cosleeping, sharing the bed, etc. but it is really starting to wear on us, and there doesn’t seem to be any end in sight.

Bub will fall asleep in my arms after his bottle, is completely passed out, and when I put him down he immediately wakes and starts rolling around and yelling....not crying or fussing, just yelling/babbling very loudly.   It's made it so we have to try twice every night (at least) to get him back to sleep. My husband and I do not want to sleep train through the CIO method, but he's not crying per se. Is it ok to leave him to yell himself to sleep? I don't want to give up my bedtime cuddle routine because I know he won't let me do this forever, and it has seriously been the most content I've been since being a mom. It absolutely melts my heart every night and I look forward to it. Do we have other options for helping him fall asleep easier with this routine and not CIO?",

I've read some of their work and while it is good, I think it's a little TOO high fantasy to actually be published and sell.  A few nights ago, E asked me to read a snippet of one of their newest chapters. I read it and it wasn't as good as their usual work so I told them that. They reread it, agreed with me and then started editing it.  Later, at dinner, I asked E how their writing was going. They told me that it was going well but they had writersblock and was going to focus on 'world building' until they had inspiration.  I told E that I didn't think writing was the best path for them and that they should find something that was better, like law or medicine. I bought up the chapter snippet, how long they'd been writing the book and how not all authors were like J K Rowling.  By the time I had finished, E was in tears, they wolfed down their dinner, excused themself from the table and told me that they were going to call their uncle JJ (my late wife's youngest brother).  JJ called later, yelled at me and told me that I was 'crushing my child's dreams' and told me that he wanted to take E for the rest of the weekend. I told him that he was free to take them.  E returned Monday morning and since then has only been talking to me for the necessities.  The story has managed to make it's way around both my late wife's family and my family.

Put it under a mattress?    - For college, is there a particular account, avenue, or approach someone can recommend?    - For stocks, I've been thinking about investing. Even just an index fund at Fidelity or something, been doing research and asking around and most recommend starting there. But I've heard getting a trustworthy fiduciary is a better play. I just don't even know how to go about finding one in my area and I feel like I'm a sitting duck for anyone looking to take advantage, I'm so out of my depth in general on all this. If anyone has a starting point I can explore or a resource or something, I'd be open to that.   With my ineptitude in building wealth or dealing with money (grew up poor, but today thankfully my wife and I do alright considering) I'm worried I'm not setting up my kid in the best way I can for down the road and would love to give them whatever I can to help.  Any advice on any of the above would be great. Thanks all!  EDIT: Just want to say thanks to everyone responding! Kind strangers all over. Appreciate you all <3",

We had a family birthday party this last weekend and I attempted to baby wear but the second I came in everyone went straight to touching her face to greet her so I just took her out! A few minutes later I had put her down and again someone was touching all over her face so I let them know we were trying to avoid touching/kissing her face with it being RSV season which was responded with a snarky comment that I am being over protective and not letting people touch her face would be the reason she gets sick?? So annoying. Anyway the next person that did it we let them know the same thing and they would clearly offended and didn’t interact with my daughter for the rest of the night. Mind you, not a single person washed their hands, so I just don’t understand what is so offensive about me not wanting my 10 weeks old daughter to have peoples unwashed hands in her face. I am officially dreading thanksgiving because I know it’ll be more of the same!",

He's perfectly able to understand what we say to him, but it's difficult for us to understand what HE wants some of the time which is very frustrating for him.

Seriously, he has always consistently slept through the night until 7, usually 8am, unless he is sick or teething. Sleep regressions were minimal, night wakings were always only occasional. You could say he was a unicorn baby. We did use Ferber method to help him learn to fall asleep on his own without needing to be rocked by one us at bedtime and he caught onto that after about a week of training.   Cut to him turning 14 months old and getting his first molars.   He began waking up at night crying, unable to fall back to sleep at all. At times it would be 3 hours before I was able to get him back to sleep. We’ve since learned some tricks, like to use Motrin instead of Tylenol because it lasts longer. He’s now consistently waking up at least 2 times per night crying and thankfully doesn’t stay awake, but needs held and comforted before he’ll fall back to sleep. I fear this isn’t teething, but I also fear that he is indeed in pain and I’d be ignoring it during another round of sleep training.   He just had his last molar break through the gums and I don’t see any other signs of swelling or emerging teeth, yet he’s still waking up every single night.   I’m 39 weeks pregnant with #2, and I would love to get this figured out before we add a newborn to the mix!",

The 10 min.... I set him down and i went to the bedroom. He sleeps in the dining room area of our small apartment, that way when he cries the upstairs neighbors aren't as bothered by the crying during the night since we have the same layouts.  Well i checked on him on the camera and i closed out of the camera. He was just crying and throwing his blacker around angrily. Around 6/7 min in i heard a thump. I hoped if was something else but i turned on the light and he was crawling towards me on the ground. This dude literally jumped out of his bed. My mom heart ached so much, i literally gave up and just rocked him to sleep.

    "self_text": "**** update added towards the bottom  Hi all, I'm a father of a 10-month-old, looking to nurture musical interest and encourage perfect pitch.  I'm just wondering if anyone is aware of pitch-accurate piano/keyboard (/toys) suitable for maybe 10-12 month    onwards   .  not talking about anything fancy (though am equally interested).  we have piano toys, but either it's a case of you can press the same key over and over and it plays all the different notes of a song, or there's just 4 keys that are numbered 1-4 and the notes are flat and not equal intervals.  Baby Einstein Magic Touch Piano would have been perfect (feel free to take a look to see what I mean.  I haven't linked so-as-to adhere to the subreddit rules), except for comments that all the notes are a quarter-tone off, the black keys are the same notes as the white keys, and the pitch can vary between identical devices. Otherwise, it's age appropriate (6-36 months) and has a full octave by the looks of it.  (I appreciate I will likely get lots of comments critiquing the fact I'm even asking this, my intentions vs my child's age etc. etc., or of course the 'why don't you X instead'.  I'll just say right now, I appreciate in advance your time, but if your response isn't actually answering my question, I won't be engaging with it.)   **   Update: thank you to those who gave thoughtful and useful responses.     Honestly.... what is wrong with some people...  I have perfect pitch and, as a singer (primarily), have found it VERY useful, especially in musical theatre etc. Where I have had to come straight into a song where there's been no reference notes etc. And it starts acapella. I've been in shows where people have had to have someone play the note for them off-stage and they've tried their best to keep it in their head.... Yes people can get by, people can be amazing without, but IF my little boy decides he would like to be a musician and/or singer when he grows up, I want to do what I can subliminally help him through play and the things we have. Me looking for a piano/keyboard/music toy does not then mean i am forcing music upon my child. Not expecting anything from a 10 month old. Just put this in as a reference point as, if it's something he can get enjoyment from now too, that's a bonus.  My comment asking people not to veer off track was purely because my GOD it happens so much. People just love a bloody good moan and to be critical.  Thank you, again.",

    "self_text": "Sorry, this is a little sombre, but I'm just curious. My husband and I were discussing it over breakfast. Ah. Married life, eh?  His grandparents have twenty one children; two adopted, nineteen bio - we found out recently they had another bio (their 'firstborn') that they lost during labor. He either passed being delivered or shortly after.  My husband has two younger brothers, one who passed away at three months old.   We have also had three losses (I say three miscarriages; he says two miscarriages and a stillborn - we were in a car accident and I had an emergency c section in an attempt to save her, but she had already passed away).  His grandparents have only ever said they had twenty one; if you ask them about their lost baby, they will tell you he was never their child and wasn't supposed to be. They won't acknowledge him because they have other children to worry about.  My husbands parents have always said they have three. They don't talk about their middle often, but will tell you his name and everything they knew about him a hundred times over. They love that little boy with everything they have.  My husband is similar to his parents; we have fourteen living children. Generally whenever people ask how many he says \"too many to count\" but if prompted will say seventeen, followed by \"but three are not with us\".   I don't. If people ask how many I have, I also say something along the lines of \"too many\" or \"a lot\", but thats because people get judgey lol. I do say fourteen otherwise. I think I'd mention them if they passed away after I'd bonded out of the womb, but I didn't have any time with them (and I wasn't interested in cradling my deceased daughter).  Its something we've always disagreed on - not extremely so, but still. I think its inappropriate to tell, often times strangers, that we have three dead kids. It sounds harsh, but its the truth, and no one else needs to know about it. Especially not strangers who are commenting on our kids playing in the park.  He thinks I'm denying them. But, honestly, they don't hold as much place in my heart as my living children do; sure, I cry sometimes, but thats it.  We have their handprints and ashes in a cabinet (along with the ashes and paw prints of our pets, which I think is a nice place for them to be).  I don't know if maybe I'm just less attached than he is - we're both autistic and handle emotions very differently, so it could be that. Still, the conversation mostly ended in curiousity (and a few tears, but then someone pooped so I sent him on his way to hunt down the poopy diaper).

And they're so proud of they're daughters because they raised them right, but 1 is an alcoholic, 4 smoke, and none of my sisters were married before they were knocked up. None of them finished college, none of them took calculated risks to improve their stability. None of us feel safe taking risks because we don't have a support system.

First, I should say that I never wanted kids, nor have I ever spent any significant time around kids. My siblings are 10 years older than me, and by the time they had children, I was in high school and they had moved out. I’m completely clueless about real-life experience with children.  Anyway! We have an 18 month old son who is very social and playful. Due to moving during my pregnancy, he doesn’t really spend time around other kids because we don’t know anyone here. That said, he’s become very talkative over the last 6 months. We went overseas a few weeks ago and someone mentioned that he did a lot of talking for his age. We sat down and counted all the words we could think of that he says, and it came out to about 85 in English and 10 or so in German (he sometimes sits with me when I take German lessons). He will sometimes repeat three syllable words (umbrella, triangle) and puts together a few words at a time (ready, set, go or here we go).   My question is, is this normal? None of our friends have kids and when I ask my siblings, they say they can’t remember exactly when my nieces started talking more. I’ve read anywhere from 15 months to 24 months being normal, but finding a word count average has been nearly impossible. Is this because there really isn’t an “average” for his age?   TL;DR - Our 18mo son says about 100 words and sometimes uses 2-3 word sentences. Is this average? What is the average number of words for his age?",

I used to give her 2-3 options and it would help manage the tantrums but nowadays since she has figured out that her clothes are all there in the wardrobe and she would keep saying that she has more clothes n end up taking out most of her clothes out and still not choose anything to wear.   Currently we are on a holiday so we have brought limited clothes with us and she just refuses to understand, even though we involved her in packing her suitcase and reminded her several times that she would get to have only these clothes while we are away from home. Guess what? She is wearing the same dress since last 2 days, even at night. Cries hysterically until she gets tired and goes to bed.  I just can't anymore!",

    "self_text": "My husband and I have been together for 8 years, married for 1.5 years and we have a 9 month old baby together.  The last 9 months have been rough to say the least, but I feel like we were getting through it slowly.  But lately I’ve found myself resenting my husband. He’s been doing training for the last 3 years, and is very much into it and competes. He used to train 5 days a week before we had our baby and now we have the agreement that he trains 3 times a week. I work 4 days a week, 9.5 hour days and he works 5 days a week, 7.5 hour days. In total we both work full time hours. I take our daughter to and from daycare, organise all dinners, food shopping, finances, doctors appointments, swimming lessons, events and generally run day to day operations of the house. My husband does the clothes washing, and deals with everything outside (obviously more to this, I.e taking rubbish out but we do share these responsibilities daily)  On one occasion I had a bad day at work, asked him not to go to training but sensed from his reply he was reluctant not to go and so I told him not to worry and still go, although he convinced me it wasn’t a problem. But they evening he was sour, miserable because our daughter was asleep pretty much straight away, he felt it was a waste of a training day, stuff the fact his wife had a bad day, it just would have been better if he had gone to training. We spoke about this later and I basically said it upset me because in future I don’t want to ask him to not go when I need him because it creates an issue and I don’t feel I can rely on him in the case I need him on day and falls on a training day. A few months later, I needed to go to a funeral, I booked off work and my husband said he would look after our daughter, I was hesitant but he was adamant so I agreed. He had a busy day on Monday at work and was upset to be missing training  so I suggested him to go to training on another day so he would still have 3 days training, this extra day would mean me sacrificing my day where I get to do what I want to do, he accepted. Yesterday evening I tested positive to COVID, I had been feeling awful, my husband offered not to go to training but because of previous incident I told him no, and I would just deal with it.  The last 4-5 days my husband has been moody, tired, grumpy and just not a treat to be around, I mentioned this and eventually he messaged me today saying that he’s run down and burning out because work is busy, and he feels he can’t talk to me. I apologised and said I will do my best to improve so he can talk to me etc.  in all honestly, it’s really pissed me the hell off that he’s burning out when he gets to train 3 days a week, all while I’m getting smashed from all angles. I’m sure it’s selfish, and awful but I’m so just fed up with him burning out because he’s missed one day of training, or woke is buys one day, or I do rely on him to deal with our daughter so I get time to do something for myself, or you know, go to a funeral. Unfortunately I spat it and we’ve had an argument , I’m so beat down and exhausted I’m done with trying to do things to make him feel better, which makes me the worst wife.  There’s obviously a lot more to it, I can’t get all the details in without writing a book.  I don’t know how to fix it from here, I know I’m wrong but I also don’t want to apologise for how I feel.  Can someone shed some light on what the best approach is to resolve?  Note: No, my husband will not sacrifice a training day, and I won’t ask because it will forever come up in future disagreements and I do not have the mental capacity for it.",

To keep this short, my sister is the type of person who you can never count on being there for you and is not responsible. If it’s the worse choice, she’ll choose it. She also is the type to disappear from not just me but our family in general for months on end and blames it on depression/and her struggles in life. She had took advantage of me financially a few years back without batting an eye at the time, my birthday came and went this year without any acknowledgment on her end, and I also was recently engaged last year and pregnant earlier this year. She was no where to be found my entire pregnancy and even after the birth of my child she still has not even gave me as much as a congratulations, just dead silence. I’m sure her excuse is yet again, depression or stress.  Well, literally the day after I got cleared at my 6 week postpartum appointment, i get a call from our mutual relatives that she decided to appear again and announced that she’s now pregnant. She also goes on to say that she hopes our children can be friends because they’ll be close in age and that she hopes it will bring us closer together mind you she still hasn’t contacted me personally about this or heard from her in general. She sounds delusional to me.  Our one mutual relative thinks I should just be the bigger person and reach out or at least be open to a relationship with her. My thing is that she’s hurt me so much at this point that I’ve now disconnected myself from her emotionally as I don’t trust her. She only comes around when she needs something and in this case probably emotional support and possible handouts for her child down the line which I would have no problem doing if she knew how to treat people. I also now worry about her unborn child because she can’t even make good choices for herself. Not to mention the resentment I have for her not even bothering to acknowledge my child let alone my pregnancy/child birth.   Overall I feel like she robbed me of the excitement/joy of her being pregnant and our children knowing each other because of this mess she’s created between us.  Thoughts?",

This morning I took my daughter in and she was feeling a bit down this morning. She didn’t want me to go to work and came in feeling a bit sad/shy. The teacher said good morning and I encouraged her to reply but she just hugged me and was was quite sad. In general she’s very bubbly and polite but in the mornings sometimes she struggles with the routine.   The teacher then said ‘we’ll get there eventually’ or something like that. I responded with she was a bit sad this morning and she said ‘but even before half term she never replies to good morning’. I responded saying I understood but today she was particularly down and she just ignored me and started talking to another child.  Do you think I’m being ott in thinking its a bit much to pressure a 3 year old, to say good morning in this way? I know its not a big deal and manners are important but the way they’re dealing with it feels odd.",

No amount of toys or ice cream will convince him.   Yesterday,he had to have blood drawn and they needed to fill 5 tubes. After about 15 min of screaming and fighting he finally agreed to let them poke him. The girl didn’t get a good pinch and only filled one tube before the blood stopped flowing. She started digging the needle in his arm and my son flips out; she’d have to poke him again but there was simply no way that was going to happen.   We have to go back tomorrow to finish getting the lab work done. I’ve been giving him lots of water to make sure his veins are as plump as possible. Also, I’ve been trying to talk to him about it so that he understands what’s going to happen and that it’s not a surprise as well as asking him if he’s going to be brave for tomorrow. Initially he said he would be brave and let them take his blood but now he’s changed his mind.   At this point we cannot use another lab and he’s not motivated by physical things like sweets or toys.

The holiday season stresses me out, I hate the cold, I hate the snow, I hate that we only get like 8 hours of daylight, I hate the constant onslaught of  Christmas music from Halloween to New Year’s Day …. The list could go on. I’m not a happy camper in the winter months. Christmas has always kind of bummed me out specifically though. The stress of either hosting or attending holiday events makes everything feel like an obligation. Family members that I wouldn’t piss on if they were on fire giving me all sorts of input that I don’t need or want. The financial and psychological stress of buying gifts is only made worse by the guilt of receiving nice stuff and fearing that I didn’t get something nice enough for the other person. Wrap all of those feelings in being told I’m a grinch or a Scrooge for not loving every second of it and I’d rather spend Christmas alone. My wife on the other hand LIVES for Christmas. She loves everything about it, so I feel awful sharing my misery because it brings her down, which in turn makes me feel worse.   Well, this year a fun new layer got added to the mix in the form of my daughter. Now I’m stressed about being stressed. I don’t want my shitty mood to rub off on her. I want to spend quality time with her enjoying the holiday but I just struggle so much with the big sad. I want to make sure she gets nice things, but all of these other less important people in my life are sucking up my money. I want to sing Christmas music to her, but every time I hear Mariah Carey’s voice I want to jump in front of traffic. And the guilt is SOOOO much worse. I feel so much sadder/angrier/stressed out now than I have in the past holiday seasons and the idea that I’m sharing that with my daughter makes me feel sick.",

In the meantime: trying to absorb tools- coping skills- I’m searching for verbiage that would be understood by a 5 year old.. I get stuck on how to explain things or I talk too much and overstimulates him, we added putting hands up at times when becoming too much stimulation and direction being given.  I need deescalation tactics when kiddo won’t listen/hear/take in the words from my mouth no matter what. I’ve tried working less words and body language when talking shows too much.  There was a time things were wild and toys were being tossed and he was running around the house like a mad kid in a game or something- I worked out this timeout minutes and asked before raising it a minute if he was ready to take the timeout or the time getting more.   My kiddo communicated after working with it- but the thing is kiddo feels it’s too hard to be good.. like he really wanted to do this activity and I just pulled the use that to give him goal- be good- try best- and can keep up with this program .. and it came out he really wanted this but found it so hard to be good..   So that clicked with me at least a piece of info I didn’t quite realize. So I need help with visuals and breaking down explanations.

He has been “talking” with imaginary “brothers”, and tonight at the dinner table he said “I am thankful for the baby that mommy will give me.”  We are not expecting. We love our son endlessly, and have no regrets. However, we decided long ago that we do not want any more children.   I am sad and confused. I can see that our child wants a sibling.  I know that financially and practically we would be able to make it work, but my partner and I have always felt that having another child would not allow us to live the lives we would like, as happy and healthy people. We are fearful and hesitant that having another child would be detrimental to our (my) emotional well-being, and worry that we would not be able to give both children the attention they deserve.  My question is this…  For anyone who decided to have a second child, what made you realize this was the right decision?  For anyone who has one child, how do you deal with not only the societal pressure to have more, but also (if so) your child’s desire for a sibling?  Thank you for any and all input!",

It’s like my dreams were shattered the moment I went into the hospital. It was all torture. I was induced for three days that led to an emergency c section. Literally, in that moment, I knew I wouldn’t be a good parent because I couldn’t even do what my body was meant to do and successfully birth my child. I was under anesthesia and didn’t wake up for hours after the birth. Maybe we’ve never been able to build a connection because of that.   I love my son, but I don’t think I was meant to be a parent and it scares me because I don’t want to ruin him, like I already feel I have. I have several “mom friends” with infants the same age or a few months apart. No one goes through what I go through - so it is apparent I am doing something wrong, but I don’t know what, so it feels like I’m doing everything wrong. Their children nap after they play. Mine doesn’t. They don’t wake up multiple times a night, every night, for the past year. But my son does. I consider it a victory if I only wake up with him 1-2 times a night. Everyone else’s children sleep great apparently. They tell me to let him cry it out- that doesn’t work. He gets more worked up.  I watch my friends with their children - and their 12 month olds talk to me - they say hi, do gestures like waving and clapping - and my son does not. He says a few words (mama, dada, bubba) and can hi-5, but that’s it. And I feel like I’m doing something wrong because I’m the stay at home parent and I’m the one whose mainly responsible for his development.   It makes me feel so much worse seeing the way people talk about their babies like they can’t imagine a life without them, but I’m over here thinking I ruined both of our lives bringing him into the world.",

    "self_text": "Hey parents! I am wondering when you guys Would tough it out and when you would switch back to a crib? Reference, my daughter turned two in July and she is sharing bedroom my nine month old son. Neither of them are particularly great sleepers… they have trouble putting themselves back down and sometimes even going to sleep in general. We live with my parents so letting them fuss/cry isn’t an option, we can’t separate them into different rooms, and they don’t sleep well in our bed. We have white noise on for them (one for each side of the room), and a nightlight.   When we decided to move my daughter into a toddler bed, it was partially because from 12 months until now, she wakes up crying anywhere from 2-7 times a night needing us to put her back to sleep. It’s usually just us coming to hug her and put her back down. Now I don’t mind doing that, but it’s EVERY night, usually no less than 2-4 times a night. Keeping in mind that I also have a 9 month old in the same room who wakes up when she cries and doesn’t sleep well anyway. I haven’t been able to hold a job the last 6 months because I’m getting so little sleep, that I can’t function and sleep through my alarms.   Ironically, when we decided to turn her bed into a toddler bed, she got a cold that same night after it was done so that’s been hard. But we are now walking her back to their room on average 10-15 times a night and she doesn’t seem to get it. It’s been almost 2 weeks. I can be nice and warm, firm, silent, angry, make bribes, threaten (like threaten to put her crib back) and it makes NO difference.   When do I give up and try again later?? Any tips before I do?? She has a consistent bedtime routine and general schedule. She’s usually in bed by about 7-7:30 but it’s been closer to 7:30-8:30 since she got sick and kept waking herself up by coughing so hard she would throw up. She takes 1 nap a day and doesn’t have a problem staying in her bed at nap time.",

I told my wife about these meetings last week and said we should prepare for one of our kids being sick.  They ALWAYS get sick on the worst possible work days.  Wondering when this 'daycare immunity' I hear so much about actually starts or is this just myth?",

I had planned to stay at home for a while and try to work from home, but that isn’t panning out after trying for months to find some stable, at-home work.   I have an 8 year old as well, who I stayed home with for almost 3 years. I’ve never had to put a baby in daycare and I’m so torn about this. We need the money pretty badly, but I am devastated at the thought of not getting to be home with my baby every day. My son is also breastfed and not great at taking bottles.

She sits on the toilet and does her wee in it, and occasionally gets a poo in there too. However we are at the stage where if I prompt her about once an hour she will have zero accidents all day and all is great, however if I don't prompt her she just goes in her undies. She doesn't seem to know when she needs to go, except maybe like once a day she will accurately identify a need and then go.  She is upset when she has an accident, helps clean up, and gets fresh undies. There's no shame or punishment, we just clean up and get changed. She has a sticker chart for successful wees but isn't that interested. She prefers undies to nappies as well.  So is she ready or not? How do you teach them how to tell when to go? She seems to be ready in all other areas. Is it just something that comes with time? I feel like she would be really upset if we went back to nappies, and she is so independent with taking her pants down and getting dressed etc. She can even wipe with paper and flush too.",

He’d get out of bed and come to ours, and one of us would calmly return him to his bed. Repeat all night. If we stayed in his room until he fell asleep, he’d wake up crying when he realized we weren’t still there. He will not verbalize any reason for the change in behavior.  From infancy, there were NEVER any sleep problems. He always went to sleep easily and slept through the night (except waking him up to breastfeed).   Parent 1 : feels like the best long-term solution is to continue to calmly take turns returning the 3yo to his bed in the hopes that in a matter of days or weeks this phase will pass and things return to normal.    Parent 2 : feels that whatever the problem is, it won’t be solved by forcing him to remain in his room alone. This parent has started sleeping with him in his room in the meantime, although even then he still has trouble sleeping.  What do we do?

He is blaming his lack of ability to succeed in school and maintain a job for this very reason. I'm calling a bluff as I did research on these types of microbleeds and apparently many are asymptomatic.   We've taken him to a psychologist for ADHD and my son claims the medication they gave him didn't work or he didn't like the way it made him feel. He refuses to get on any other medications including one that may treat depression.  Instead, he wants us to spend $100,000 on a neuroscientist to fix that part of his brain that he is claiming is the reason why he can't succeed in life. I told him I do not have that money, to which he threatened that he would just stay home under our roof and do nothing for the rest of his life. Also, this treatment he speaks of apparently doesn't guarantee it will fix anything but will help. It's also not FDA-approved, regardless I can't contribute to it.

She is not a good eater anyway (we are in OT for feeding issues) & has only ever liked chicken, no it's on the no list. She seems genuinely disturbed by finding this out & keeps telling us reasons why we shouldn't eat birds. She's also restarted telling us reasons why we shouldn't eat cows (but not pigs, she is convinced we don't actually eat pigs). It's not just that she doesn't want to eat meat, she also gets upset when we do it. I've told her she can choose what she eats but I like meat & want to eat it, she responds by continuing to tell us why we shouldn't.  Reasons she's given:. Birds have babies they protect. Even if the one I'm eating didn't have babies, it would if it was allowed to. \"We can't just kill things to eat them!\". It's wrong to kill things, anything, I wouldn't want to be killed to be eaten. We aren't supposed to hurt animals, animals are for petting not hurting.  Help 😭  ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓  ETA: Thank you to everyone who replied, I can't reply to everyone so here is some thing I saw come up the most:   •  I do not have any intentions to make her eat meat. If she chooses to I will encourage her to & if she chooses not to I will encourage that too. Unless a choice she's making is unsafe or unhealthy I let her decide within reason. To the people suggesting I hide meat in her food to trick her into eating it - that's going to be a hard no.    •  My initial question was is this a phase or an age thing, it appears to be pretty equally split on if it is or not. So, I guess we'll see. Thank you to everyone who answered ❤️   •  There were a lot of suggestions that I talk to her about the food chain which I intend to do today. I will tell her that some animals need eat other animals for survival & that others eat plants to survive, but that we as humans can eat both & it's our choice if we want to eat other animals or not. I feel like this is the most fair approach. I will not be letting her watch videos of animals eating other animals, not will we be watching farm animals being killed, I'm not sure why anyone felt the need to suggest these but no.   •  To the people who suggested I make it clear that she cannot choose what her dad & I eat, I have. However she's 5 & in her mind she sees eating animals as mean, cruel, and wrong. I will continue to let her know she can't make decisions for us, but I don't view her telling us not to as her being \"the boss\" this is new to her, she is still navigating the situation.   •  To anyone who tried to shame me - save it. I don't need to hear about how I'm \"letting the liberals raise her\" or how she's too sensitive, or that I'm not being a stern enough parent.",

He likes to control the child support, and frankly if he doesn’t get his way during the week then he simply won’t give it to me. He likes to invite us over during the week knowing my daughter has school just so she will go to sleep late. He won’t pick her up on weekends if he’s mad at me(happens every week). Then he blames me for not having her on his weekends mind you I have all the messages from Jan until now of me asking him to pick her up and he gives a different excuse every time and blames me. I even dropped her off one time and he would not open the door for her in 110 degrees weather this summer which he was supposed to have her all summer. That was because I didn’t go inside so he wasn’t watching her . Then we’re there last weekend, she takes a shower and I had taken her a bag full of clothes to keep there, I ask him where’s her clothes at? Her drawers are EMPTY with a few clothes that doesn’t fit her. He looks around, doesn’t find anything so I put her dirty clothes back on her. He goes to store and I’m getting his (2) year daughter dressed and a bunch of MY CLOTHES and my daughters clothes are stuffed in the 2 year olds drawers in her room. I am appalled and furious at this point. Why would he do that? I don’t understand, I’ve tried to look at it with every perspective and I can’t! I babysit for him when he asks. I’m always buying his daughter clothes, shoes, and he’s constantly damaging clothes, tvs, anything jn my house that’s valuable, he broke my daughters iPad, stole her gold earrings. I hate my life.

    "self_text": "In an effort to give back to the community, I’d like to provide my humble tips on traveling with my wife, 4.5yo and 2.5yo to Disneyland. Enjoy…    Buffets are great. We’ve done a mix of buffets and “normal” sit down meals and the buffets are way better. Having to entertain little kids who didn’t practice restaurant behavior much due to COVID (and are hyped up due to the rides, etc) is not fun. With the buffets, they’re eating 5 minutes after they sat down.    If you’re going to do character meals, choose Minnie’s breakfast and Goofy’s kitchen. Both have pre-meal photo ops and Minnie’s breakfast was the only place we’ve seen Pooh, Tigger, and Daisy, along with other character.     Rent a stroller; solves the “kids are tired and don’t want to walk” problem. And the rental companies drop them off at the hotel for you. It’s fantastic.     Lightning Lane is great but rider switch is even better. It’s easy to forget about rider switch since I don’t see it advertised at the park. How it works - With Rider Switch, one adult or supervising Guest (14 years or older) can wait with non-riders while the rest of the party enjoys the attraction. Then, they simply switch roles to allow the supervising Guest to experience the attraction  without  waiting in the regular queue again.    The Disneyland train ride is risky. Seemed safe but a portion of the ride goes through a tunnel showing the prehistoric era with large dinosaurs and thunder and our LO’s were not pleased.     Tuffo’s. We had 2 days with rain but had rain suits (we prefer Tuffo brand) for the kids. This kept them happy enough. And the parks are emptier on foul weather days so more rides have shorter times, although certain rides were shutoff.     On a nice day, we saw lots of characters starting at 2:30pm in the Main Street USA area. But YMMV.     As of now, Toontown is still closed, which is a huge pain. Our LOs would have loved it.     As for hotels, Grand Californian is working for us.     If you use a travel potty, the plastic bags are forbidden as they’re considered potential biohazards. Security wouldn’t let us into the park with them so plan accordingly. But diapers are OK.    Bonus Tips:    Find spots where your LOs can run around. In California Adventure, there’s a landing across the water from the Ferris Wheel that was pretty empty. Great place to let little kids run safely to expend some energy.     If you get to California Adventure early on a nice day, Radiator Springs Racers is super popular. That means most other attractions have very short lines. We got through 4 Pixar pier rides before 9am because the lines were super short.     At Goofy’s Kitchen, you can take a character photo without a reservation, since the photo happens outside the restaurant and they don’t check if you have a reservation.",

My daughter 13 had begged me to play and I always said no. She is now asking for me to get snap chat and I have a hard no. I’m at a loss. I’ve been convinced I might be over reacting to Fortnite but I am still a strong no on social media.   I don’t want my daughter to feel like my son is being favored or more persuasive. To add to this she recently turned 13 and suddenly wanna watch any more PG-13 movies as a family while he is still 11. Feel like I’m failing!",

I feel awful, like if I’m pregnant I feel like I’m gonna be looked at as one of those moms who loses their kids and has more.  Five days after my period I had some unusual spotting. Very light and short. I didn’t think much of it as I was just on my period. Then about a week ago I start feeling sick. Outta no where. I’m so exhausted and I feel drained from just hanging with people. And now to top it off my 4days late. Since I’d gotten my iud out I’d been pretty regular. Never more than 2 days. Tomorrow makes 5. And I’m scared. It’ll be a blessing but I’m terrified.  My son just turned 5 this July. I was so happy for that. But I’m scared that I’m not even ready mentally for him next month. I’m scared I’m not okay, I just lost my sister. I had a melt down because I was idk. Manic? That I’m still drained from. I’m trying to find therapy and get some more things sorted out. My best bet here lately has been doing reading on certain things that’ll help.  But I’m freaking out!!!",

I feel horirble on nights that she eats alone, but she honestly doesnt seem to mind it. When i do sit with her. She just plays with her food the whole time.   I think i dont like them because all i hear is chewing even with music or tv in the background and growing up we would all sit down and have a family dinner just to listen to my dad talk about his day at work which really just annoyed me when i was a kid/teenager.   Does anyone else not like family dinners? Are they out dated now? Am i wrong for not wanting to eat together? Cause i feel like since i sit with her when she wants me to its not so bad.",

I've been in my daughter's life the past 3 years and have adopted her. For some reason she demands all of the attention, an act in bizarre ways.  For instance, with her grandma, when she talks to her grandma she paints a picture of her not being taken care of. 2 days ago they were talking and she was whining because we ran out of pizza. She talked to her grandma and painted a negative picture of the household. She acted like she never gets fed (mind you she had cookies, a bowl of cereal, and 2 slices of pizza for dinner). An her grandma feeds into it. I asked her afterwards when she got off the phone why she acts like we don't feed her when she know we make her dinner all the time. Even pointed out how often we make dinner and because she doesn't like what we make especially make things for her. She got real angry and acted like she was crying but there were no tears. She refused to answer me.  That's just for one example, point out there but there are many more I could go on and on.  It's like she wants to paint the picture that she is miserable and not cared for but she is carried for and receives more attention than our other child.   I've spoken to her therapist about it, she said she will talk to her.  Her mom is bipolar idk if she might be too",

    "self_text": "Some background. My wife and I are both irreligious, I'm agnostic and my wife believes that there's a God, but doesn't follow one religion. My wife and I have discussed how we want to handle religion with regards to our children and we're both in total agreement. We don't want to bias our children for or against any one religion, and want them to develop their own opinion on the matter. We're fine if they follow a religion or if they don't, as long as they're not a total twat about it. So as such we haven't ever said anything like \"X is right or wrong.\"  This is fairly easy when they're young, but as they get older our only concern with this approach is if some sort of religious fundamentalist starts talking to them about it, and it being their first exposure might be the one that takes. So... How do we talk to our kids about religion that will save them from being a crazy person, but doesn't put them in the same box we fit in? I'd love to hear how others have tried to handle this idea.  For reference our oldest is in kindergarten, and would be the first one we'd talk to about it. He's already asked before what happens after you die, and we explained that no one knows for sure, and told him that some people believe in heaven, reincarnation, a few other ideas, and that some people think that there's just nothing afterwards. We then each told them what we think happens and that as he grows up he can think about it and decide what he thinks happens.",

    "self_text": "Hello guys, I am new here. Pardon me for any mistakes.   I am a working woman who had a pretty bad time with PPD after my cesarean delivery. So we hired more than 1 nanny to take care of the baby at different times of the day.   The thing is, from the very first, she rejected my breast and I didn't have much supply. So, she is exclusively formula fed, and that too, most of the time, by nannies, as I was not in a position to take care of her. But the entire day, I used to be around till she was 5 months old and that is much more than her dad ever was.   I joined back work when she was 5 months old. My interaction with her is at times, when I come back from work and I play with her for sometime, and when she sleeps with me at night. These days she is quite fussy before going to sleep and I am able to put her down for a goodnight sleep.   The issues I am facing bonding with her-    We live in a joint Asian family. And the whole day of time with her is distributed with nannies, different family members like her grandparents   As a result, the time window with for me & the baby is incredibly small. Also I constantly feel tired throughout the day with office work and other chores to give her much quality time     She doesn't want to be fed the bottle by me. This is true for other family members as well. She prefers the nannies always in this matter. Also, she doesn't like milk compared to other food items. When it comes to the latter, it's definitely easier to feed her semi solid food items & I try to do that at least once or twice a day     She prefers her dad to me. She would smile at him whenever she catches a glance of him.     The only positive thing is, when she is fussy & crying, I instantly care for her, and she responds, generally, by calming down.   Now, as she is approaching her 7th month, I feel lost as a mother as I think she doesn't recognise me as Her mother and she doesn't seek my company.   There are limitations about hoy much I can do to improve the situation, given that I am still going through weakness post delivery, my work schedule, and the time she compulsorily has to spend with her grandparents and the way she is completely dependent on her nannies for feeding.   I am quite overwhelmed with the situation. Please advise what to do. Do you think, my child will continue to not form a bond with me, even after she gets older?",

The hospital gave us Enfamil but it made her very gassy. You could hear her belly gurgling and she’d look upset.   We switched to Earths Best formula on Saturday. We seemed to have no issues. But the last time she pooped was yesterday morning.   She eats about an ounce or 2 each feed every 3-4 hours. Shouldn’t she be pooping after each feed? I tried the bicycle legs last night. She farted a few times but no poop. Do I wait and continue giving her the Earths Best formula? Do I switch back to Enfamil? I can’t just not feed her but what if I block her up more?  Please help. This is my first baby and I just want her to poop and be comfortable.",

    "self_text": "MIL lost her husband of 32 years this February. We’ve suffered from the deep sorrow that was his cancer journey and passing. I miss him terribly. He was the equalizing force of the family. Always kept things together, made you feel valued and loved. Brought my husband (only child 44yo) down from his angers, was his coach, his friend and most importantly he was the father that he didn’t have. He was truly remarkable.   She is point blank traumatized and her grieving has made my life hell. Her usual stress is now 10 fold. My husband can’t deal and channels it all on me. Scolding me , screaming at me, you name it. She was already dramatic and sensible, now it’s that plus a roller coaster of emotions from one moment to another. I have lost patience… Thanksgiving yesterday was a nightmare. My husband and I have had a very difficult year, in part because of her. She helps with the kids, so I see it as the emotional cost of her help, and being a collateral in her process.   She favors the boy, takes him over to her house to spend the night and day after, she will take him to music classes, she will pick him up from school and buy and buy and buy things for him. Because they took care of him before his illness that is the light of her life and she treats him very differently than my baby girl. She’ll make comments about her all the time, some that I heard in many occasions and that I prefer not to repeat.   Yesterday she said to my mother that my kids shouldn’t spend so much time together because she (my girl) will rile him up and that if it would’ve been two boys it would be different. My girl is smart and independent. She is determined sweet and so tender. He is the one that follows her around all day!! He will take things from her, and do exactly what she does. We know he wants the attention so we divide and celebrate both.   To this comment my mom said “they are brother sister and we must foster their relationship not separate them, they’re figuring it out together”. Apart from the couple of outbursts she had there at the gathering out of nowhere (I know, she is simply grieving) the comments are all the time. The comparisons (I can’t!!) the he did this he does that. Sometimes in front of the kids!!!  I can be compassionate with her, but I can’t be ok with her blatant favoritism for him and disregard for her. I will speak to my husband to see if he wants to handle it or if he’s ok with me bringing it up.",

    "self_text": "I have a 4-year-old daughter and she is sweet and precious and hilarious and smart. But she is also so disagreeable and stubborn. It makes gentle parenting extremely difficult and honestly, I find this age so much more difficult than the toddler years. She has a particularly hard time with the transition from playing/iPad time to getting ready for bed. We give her lots of warnings (15 minutes until stories, 5 more minutes of playtime, etc) so it's not like it's a sudden transition. It is always a HUGE fight, she will whine and cry and run away and just have a huge tantrum. Here are some other examples of the things she gets irrationally angry at:  -She didn't want to wear her winter boots this morning. Just a complete refusal to put them on, which resulted in us being late. I don't want to hold her down and force them on her - that's not the type of parenting I subscribe to. So it's SOOOOOO frustrating.  -She barely eats supper and an hour/half hour later she wants a snack. Ugh, fine. We offer her more of her supper, or fruit, veggies, or yogurt. She wants none of that and just whines and moans and groans about it. Eventually, it becomes a fight because we get frustrated and are like PICK SOMETHING OR GO HUNGRY! She said she wants cheese, so we sliced her some cheese. Then she said NOT LIKE THAT, I LIKE SHREDDED CHEESE. Kill me now!!  I am cognizant of the fact that she is a little person with big feelings, and she can't control this. My husband and I are extremely fair, and we try our best to be patient and accommodating. But I don't want to raise a spoiled, entitled brat who learns that by whining gets everything she wants.   My thinking is to take away the iPad for the rest of the month to see if it changes her behaviour. She is in daycare from 8:30-4 where they spend the day playing, doing activities/crafts, reading, yoga/Zumbini, and it really is a busy, happy environment, so I am typically happy to let her have some time watching her YouTube shows (she likes watching dolls play and listening to songs like Cocomelon, etc). I know it helps me decompress, but I also know some children are sensitive to screen time.   I don't know what else to do. Is this a my kid-specific issue, or is this just life with a 4-year-old?

Really creative, smart, talkative, artistic, loves to read, loves to watch his shows ya know? Typical 6 year old boy. Loves playing Sonic.. he has his bad habits like constantly interrupting the teacher during class, disrupting the other kids, can’t sit still to save his life, he talks really really loud when he gets excited.. and he also picks his nose a lot and uh.. eats his boogies. Lol we try to get him to stop and at this point he just does it without thinking. I wouldn’t say any of those are bad habits by like mom standards or social standards… but class standards yes. He drives his teacher wild sometimes.   Well the last week or two, when I pick him up, he’s so quiet. It’s not like him. He just gets in the car, doesn’t say much, he always says he had a good day, not much more.. I never push it, I always try to kind of catch him off guard when he’s in a good mood after snack, tablet time, outside time, whatever and he usually opens up and tells me about his day. Usually pretty good.. but not lately, it breaks my mom heart.  Today, typical Monday, pick him up at 4 after art club “Hey baby how was your day today?” “It was okay” “Yea? Well good I’m glad hun did you get to play with all your friends today?” “No D played with other kids today” “D played with other kids? That’s okay did you play other kids too?” “No I just played by myself today” “Well honey that’s okay too, sometimes it’s good to just play by ourselves and have that little peace and quiet ya know? Especially after being out of school for a week, were you just tired?” “No” “Okay honey, well I love you so much” “I love you momma”  I didn’t push it after that. He just sounds really sad and it breaks my heart. We had to make a stop after that and he insisted he wanted to stay in the car which is so unlike him. He usually begs to come in with me.. we live in such a small town so I parked right outside the door, ran in for 5 minutes, could see him the whole time from 30 feet away, and came back out, he was just staring out the window. And didn’t even say hi to me.   Sorry for the essay. I’m just worried about him. Worried he might be getting bullied. He’s not tired, he perks when he gets home. I just try to tell him alot that I love him and hug him and let him have his time.",

Option B has an opening for next month and cannot say when they will have another opening.     Option A:   Current program.  Convenient. It's within walking distance.  Drop-off and pickup hours are flexible, with latest possible pickup at 5:30 pm. Kiddo seems happy. We don't agree with the current teachers' teaching style and but we know their approach is common. The next classroom which starts at age 3 or 3.5 seems to have more experienced teachers and a better student-to-teacher ratio, which could change quickly. This school has had a ton of turnover in the past year; they also recently re-opened and that next classroom is not fully booked yet.    Option B.   Bilingual and Montessori daycare/preschool, both of which we really value.  She has had Montessori-certified teachers in the past (who moved out of state) and the quality of instruction and was markedly better; our kiddo seemed to pick up concepts more quickly. However, the school is less convenient. Adds 1.5-2.25 hours to the commute (over the course of a week, not per day).  It is closed 3-4 weeks of the year more than Option A.  In the short term, until she is potty trained, she has to be picked up by 3:30 pm (we'd also save $500 a month).  Otherwise, she can enroll in the Spanish aftercare program and the pick-up time would be 5:30 pm (at this point, the costs between the two programs are the same).  We could tag team it/hire a sitter so that whoever needs to work past 3:30 pm can do so, but it would be less convenient in the short term.  Our child is almost 2.5 years old and we do plan to step up our potty training efforts regardless. We have tried align with Montessori principles at home (though we do more open-ended play).  Our jobs are somewhat flexible, and maybe we need better time management skills, but we do appreciate the full-time coverage Option A provides regardless of potty training status, as well as the shorter commute. On the other hand we think she would cognitively benefit at Option B, and we don't know if/when we would have another opportunity to enroll.   Which one would you choose?",

Most of the time, I let him choose what he wants to eat, but he still won't eat much.  All he seems to do well with is plain white rice, so I constantly keep some made in the fridge so at least he'll eat something.  Ironically, he'll eat junk food, but not a lot.  I no longer limit junk because I just want him to freaking eat.  In September I took him in to urgent care because I couldn't get an appointment for months with the primary care doctor.  They did NOTHING- just insisted it was a primary care problem and to wait for that appointment.  Then came Halloween- it was crazy.  He ate a whole bunch of candy (rare for him) and then freaked out because he believed his stomach was protruding.  He started crying hysterically.  When I've talked to him about his obsession with his weight, he says it's because he doesn't want to hit 100 lbs.  To him, that is fat- but for his height, it's appropriate.  A few days ago we finally had the primary care appointment and he's lost 7 lbs. since the urgent care visit.  He is now 76 lbs., and 5'2\".  According to all BMI calculations I've done, this is severely underweight, though the doctor said it's just \"slightly underweight\"?  The doctor gave him a diagnosis of anorexia, ordered some labs (those are still pending) and put in a referral for behavioral health.  I spoke with behavioral health and I could not believe what the woman told me.  She asked if he has any behavioral problems or thoughts of suicide, and I said no.  He is a typical \"anorexic\" in that he is a perfectionist.  He always gets straight A's in his classes, is every teacher's favorite, and has lots of friends.  She said, \"Oh, then we probably can't help him\".  Excuse me?  \"Well, if it's not getting in the way of his daily life, then there's not much we can do.  You're going to have to look into other resources.\"  HOW IS NOT EATING NOT GETTING IN THE WAY OF HIS DAILY LIFE?  I HAVE LOOKED INTO EVERY RESOURCE.  Every eating disorder specialist in the area has said they either don't work with kids or they are inpatient only and will only take patients who have previously been hospitalized.  Is that what I have to wait for?  Sure, there are counselors out there.  But are they really qualified to help him with this?  I mean, I guess it doesn't matter.  If that's the only resource available, then that's what I'm going to go with.  But ffs.  Have any of you dealt with something like this?  How did you get help for your child?",

    "self_text": "My daughters (age 5 and 2.5) share a room (it’s a necessity—we don’t have a 3rd bedroom). My 2.5yo sleeps through the night about 1/3 of the time, but the rest of the time she has trouble getting herself back to sleep if she wakes up between sleep cycles (so at like 130am and/or 530am). She cries, and after a few minutes that wakes up the 5yo, who then also cries and everything is a tear-filled mess. So we end up bringing 2.5yo into our bed, where she goes back to sleep til 730am—she knows this, and so now she screams “I don’t like my bed!” until we bring her to ours.   My preferred method of sleep training is letting her cry, while doing checks every 3-5 minutes to tell her “I love you, it’s time for sleep” until she gets herself back to sleep. That worked really well when my older kid was a toddler, and she would be “re-trained” within a night or two. But I can’t let 2.5yo disrupt her sister’s sleep constantly, so I’m wondering if there’s something I can do to block the noise for my 5yo—like a bed tent with a sound machine in it?   Has anyone tried this, or other solutions? I can’t be the only one with this problem.   Note that we’ve previously taken the 5yo into our bed for 1-2 nights in order to retrain the 2.5yo, and that works well, but the toddler seems to need to be retrained once every 4-8 weeks, so I’m not a fan of this back and forth dance. I’m hoping there’s a more permanent solution, until we can afford to buy a bigger house.",

    "self_text": "My daughter is 6 months old and has recently recovered from three brutal weeks of RSV and the broncholitis, double ear infections and then pneumonia it brought along. Beforehand she did well with sleeping. Half of the time we’d be able to lay her down and she’s fall asleep on her own and the other half she’s fall asleep nursing and continue to sleep once we would lay her down. She would only wake up once or twice per night, nurse then go back to sleep.   Now she will pretty much only go to sleep if she is nursing but then wake up immediately once I lay her down the majority of the time. It’s nearly a given that she’ll wake up immediately if we lay her in her bassinet, it’s about 50/50 if we put her in the swing. I’m sure she’s not filling up while nursing as she’ll fall asleep so shortly after starting to nurse, but she absolutely refuses to take a bottle now.   I do not co-sleep and there have been several times now that I’ve fallen asleep while nursing her in the middle of the night. This is clearly not a safe situation and she is not getting the rest she needs. I desperately need to get her to sleeping at least somewhat well again.   I know the main change is “lay her down drowsy not asleep,” but she goes from actively nursing to asleep and passively nursing for comfort. Does anyone have any advice to help?",

Or is it not more of a common courtesy for the host to tell the visitor that “hey, x is actually sick. Maybe we should reschedule?” Especially since there are babies at risk?  SMH.  Visited my sister, whom I’m low contact with. She has 3 boys, 3yr old and 1yr old twins. I have a 1yr old girl and 6month boy. I decided to visit because I’ll be moving to a different province and the kids will basically not see each other again and it was also the twins birthday.  I asked her about the visit, she was excited for it, talking about how the kids will not get to grow up together.  All this and she failed to tell me that her 3yr old is sick. So I then pack up my children, make the 1hr drive over to her place.  After about an hour, the 3yr old is having a coughing fit. She’s ignoring him and im like maybe you should attend to him? Oh no, he’s fine, just a bug he brought home from daycare.  Like excuse me? And you didn’t provide this information when the plans were being made so I could protect my children?  Now my 1yr old is projectile vomiting everything for the past 2 days and my 6 month old is miserable, and that is puting it lightly. To make matters worse, there is a shortage of baby/ kids Tylenol and Advil. Oh yea, and I also caught this bug.  Like I’m just pissed. I find that this could’ve been avoided if she had been forthcoming.  But then I remember why I’m also low contact.   Sigh.  Edit: Since some people are not getting it: My daughter is 19 months old and my son is 6 months. My family had been home. I’m on maternity leave and hubby was working from home since we’ve been packing for the move. Last time we went out was on Oct 23 for groceries. It’s cold out so me and the kids don’t do our regular walks outside. We went to her place on Nov 5. Her place is the only place we could’ve possibly caught anything. My daughters symptoms started on Monday.  I really don’t understand some of the things people are saying. All I wanted was some damn common courtesy and the option to make an informed decision. My 6month old has gotten sick before and had to be admitted to the hospital. This is information that she knew. She was fully aware of how hard it was dealing with 2 kids under 2 and having them both sick with no available medication. This is why I’m upset. I’m well aware that my children will get sick, but if I can help avoid it, then I damn well will try.  Thank you to everyone else for understanding and hearing my frustration.",

    "self_text": "TL;DR: 9y.o. is allowed to decide how to manage his weekly homework. Bio-mom disagrees and wants him to do exactly half at each home during the weeks he goes to her. As a result, she is not allowing him to do more than half of his homework when he's with her even if that means it will be incomplete.   My stepson is 9 years old and in the 4th Grade. His weekly homework is always the same. He has the week to complete the same set of assignments (takes about an hour each day Monday to Thursday, due on Fridays). His teachers grade for completion rather than accuracy. He never needs help with his homework and he has a checklist for the week to keep track of his progress.   He knows what is expected of him, so his dad and I thought this would be a great opportunity to practice time management and prioritizing his time. We have allowed him full control of what assignments he wants to complete on what days. We keep him accountable and make sure all homework is eventually completed when it's due.   His mother seems to have a huge issue with this to the point that she is not going to let him finish his homework this week. Dad has primary physical custody, and so their son is with mom Wednesday through Sunday every other week (9 nights with us and then 5 nights with his mom is the rotation).   For the weeks that he does have to go to his mom, he chooses to do less than half of his homework beforehand so that he can have a little extra free time with his dad before he leaves. She has been complaining about this constantly and wants us to make him do exactly half of his homework before he goes to her. This week she has said that she is not going to let him do any more than exactly half of his assignments, which means his homework this week will be incomplete. Her reasoning is that it is somehow interfering with his childhood and he should be playing with his friends after school.  I'm baffled to say the least. We have exactly zero issues with homework when he's with us. The only person making a fuss is bio-mom. Someone please tell me if we're in the wrong. The way he divides up his homework when he has to go to his mom results in about 15-20 extra minutes a day that Wednesday and Thursday he's with her.",

I’ve attributed it to him going through a developmental change/growth spurt, etc. nothings really changed too much and our life is the same it’s always kind of been.   We ended up going to an indoor playground for a while to pass some time, and towards the end, I gave him about three warnings that it was almost time to go. THEN… he asks for ice cream.  deep breath. I say “ no buddy, you had some ice cream yesterday and we don’t have treats like everyday. Sorry”. He starts bawling. 🤦🏻‍♀️ I’m thinking okay, I know how to usually turn him around from this type of situation. I validate his feelings- “I know you really want it, it sucks when we can’t have what we want” but he just starts freaking. Like full blown freaking out- which is not normal for him. He starts screaming. And I react and say, okay.. it’s time to go. And then he really loses his shit. Like full-on tantrum, screaming freak out at this indoor playground. Now I’m embarrassed and I’m trying to get outta there with him and my younger kid. Eventually I pick up the four year old and I carry him to the car. He’s still freaking, kicking, hitting and even bit me. I get him to the car and I strap him in his seat and I close the door and let him scream. And I just stand there in the cold air, my mind racing, feeling like I want to freak out and cry. I’m thinking, okay… this is the “f***ing fours” everyone is talking about.

Situation: My 3 yo daughter has generally been easy going, super intelligent ( I may be biased here), and for a long time it seemed like we had avoided a child that had big tantrums and such.   6 months ago we had a baby - Big sister still did really good considering the upheaval and has consistently been really sweet and loving with the baby.   Over the last month I (father) was traveling for work a lot. I was gone for 3 full weeks (but back on weekends), then back a week, then gone 3 nights. When I was leaving for the last short stint she got sick with RSV. When I got back she still had a cough and now, a week later it's finally resolving.   - The trouble now is that over he last week she has started melting down over every little thing, refusing to do basic things, and very much struggling with transitions. I haven't always handled these meltdowns well either and have gotten very stern and loud with her a few times (feel terrible when I do, but I just feel so at a loss and don't know what to do sometimes) but we haven't ever struck/spanked her and I apologize to her for being \"mean\" and try and find a different tact.  She also coslept with my wife while I was gone, mostly so my wife could sleep because SHE doesn't sleep well when alone. Since returning we have made her stay in/go back to her bed at night because she won't hardly sleep when she's in our bed and just kicks and twists and turns for hours keeping any of us from sleeping well.   I guess after all that I just need some perspective. Have you all been through this? Does it resolve? I am just afraid that with this sudden onset of behavior and that its unlike her somehow we've damaged her or that something bigger is wrong. I guess I hope to hear someone say that it is probably temporary and that you've been through it and they go back to the sweet kid again after a couple weeks. But if not I want to know how I can help her :'(  Edit: After a couple weeks of getting back to routine she has been 1000 times better behaved and back to her silly goofy self! Guess I have a lot to learn about kids and the phases they go through and how change impacts them. Thanks for the responses though! They really helped me get things into perspective.",

    "self_text": "My daughter is 23, going on 24. This past summer she married the man she loves, another 24 year old kid. They both graduated college just last year and are in the very early stages of their careers; my daughter is still in grad school. Despite all that, they are now in the process of trying to purchase their first house. I for one am very supportive. They're adults and seeing them trying to put together a life warms my heart. But I am still very worried for the both of them. They're both so young and I know my daughter, and she really doesn't know what she's doing. Nor does my SIL, nor does any 24 year old to be quite frank with you. I will always be supportive but I'm always thinking about whether they run into roadblocks and how they'll be able to navigate past it. I think back to myself at 24. Looking back, I was definitely not ready to start settling down and I feel as though it's much harder in today's world.   My biggest worry in all this is that they're going too fast and it'll end badly. I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not. We're definitely giving them all the privacy and help they need but sometimes I do wish they would at least slow down a little bit and get more established in their careers.",

    "self_text": "My husband thinks I spoil our 1 month old son cause he crys but as soon as he gets picked up he stops...which in my husband's mind means he's crying because he wa to be picked up and baby has gotten what he wants by daddy picking him up.  I still don't understand y he has such an issue picking his own son up if he is crying tho.  Anyway, there have been SO many times where when my husband has our son and I hear the baby screaming bloody murder, I go to them and my husband has his gaming headphones on basically ignoring our son...he tells me to leave him alone cause he just wants to get picked up and to let him cry it out.  I'm sorry but if I see a baby red in the face and he's been crying longer than 5 minutes I'm going to check him to see what's wrong. 9 times out of 10 it's something simple, like he's uncomfortable and needs to be repositioned, needs a diaper change(he has a rash, suprise suprise right?) Or he's over stimulated or tired and wants  to sleep.  My son hardly crys when he's with me...only when I miss his early hungry cues or sometimes during a diaper change, cause of the rash.  I don't hold my son all day, but I do tend to his needs. I talk to him and explain what I'm doing, take him around the house and show him things, which he seems to like.  My husband props him up on the couch in his den and leaves him there, no talking, no interaction, nothing.  How can I get my husband to see he needs to interact better with our son and that he can't spoil him by holding him?",

    "self_text": "I'm looking not just for personal opinions/experiences but also for evidence based points of view. I have my (8 months old) baby's little bed fixed next to mine so I breastfeed him laying down to make him fall asleep both as a bed routine in the evening and as a strategy for the night's awakenings (usually just one in the early morning). I'm quite ok with this situation because I don't have to kill my back making him fall asleep in my arms (10 kg are too much for my post-pregnancy back) and if he wakes me during the night I don't have to fully wake up, can stay in bed and go back to sleep in a couple minutes.  I'm just afraid I'm getting him into a bad habit and not letting him to actually learn how to sleep by himself. I try to gradually reduce the breastfeeding time (it's just a couple minutes usually) and started to read aloud, whispering, during the last breastfeeding of the day so he associates hearing me whispering to falling asleep and we can maybe use this trick later (reading stories without breastfeeding to put him to sleep).

Ive checked the couch, and will be checking again. Beds have been dissected. Oh god I hope it's not in a pocket, or a vent. I've checked under all kitchen appliances. And on. And in.

On the plus side, I'm getting closer to having a Martha Stewart ready house, so there's that.  Also thanks for the silver!  Edit: gonna bite the bullet and look outside before tackling the last rooms. They are last for a reason. It's not in the backyard, though there is frost, and a graveyard of toys forgotten back there, so...

Fundamentally, neither of us are doing anything differently from a disciplinary standpoint but he seems to act up only when I'm at work. Any ideas on what we can do to bridge the gap? I don't have any tips as we're apparently raising different kids.   When I inevitably have to punish him he seemingly understands and accepts it but after a period of being a model child he reverts back to the attitude.   If it makes a difference we're a single household and despite not being married, very much a close/ affectionate family. Any advice? His mum is a star and doesn't let any of this affect her but I'm not gonna let my son grow up with no respect for his mother.   Sorry for the rant, I've typed this out a few times and this is the most coherent I could come up with",

    "self_text": "Some background info: My son is almost 5. He has sensory processing disorder, he seeks out touch. He also exhibits some ADHD behaviors (my husband has severe ADHD since he was little) but hasn’t been formally diagnosed. He’s been evaluated for autism and both psychologists agree he’s not on the spectrum. He has OT sessions once a week and has progressed well over the past 7 months.  He’s so sweet, very cuddly, he’s the first to run over and check on a hurt kiddo, but he hardly ever tells anyone he loves them. My husband and I both tell him all the time we love him, my husband and I regularly tell each other I love you, I always tell my parents I love them when we leave their place, but my son doesn’t. It’s like it doesn’t click or something. I’ve told him that it hurts my feelings when he doesn’t say it back but that hasn’t seemed to help either (honestly I don’t know that I should have even said this to him?).  Did you have to teach your littles to say I love you? Or did they pick it up? I know he loves me and that I’m probably just being insecure but it breaks my heart when I drop him off at preschool and the other kids tell their parent I love you. He gives me big hugs and kisses but then all he says is “I wanna watch you go”. Anyone have any advice?",

    "title": "Single dad struggling with 5 y/o",
    "self_text": "I'm a primary custodian father (about 80% single parent) of a 5 year old girl who's really had some difficulties lately.  She has gone through a lot of change her in short life (many homes and caretakers, divorce, a stage of 50/50 parenting, followed by her mom leaving the state, adjusting to my new girlfriend and her 3 year old frequently staying with us over the weekend).  Since April when we moved into a place of our own out of my parents house and began Pre-K things have slowly gotten a lot more difficult for both of us.  The most difficult thing is her issues in the middle of the night.  She pees the bed (I believe in her sleep) almost nightly a couple hours after falling asleep even if she went just before sleeping or had very little liquids post dinner.  A good night for me is her wetting herself, changing her pjs and going back to sleep without waking me.  A bad night for me is her having a 30-45 minute night terror, followed by wetting the bed, then waking up in an awful mood where she may demand something without telling me what it is.  \"I want something!\", growling, crying, it can go on for 30 minutes until I figure out she wants new socks.  If I try to let her cry it out she will persistently shriek and wail until I give up and go back to find a way to appease her.  The bad nights are often triggered by day time tantrumming or even transitional days after seeing her mom.   Her tantrums are often triggered by her losing her sense of control over others.  If my gf's 3 year old doesn't play according to her direction, if I make a decision about screen time/food she doesn't like, or even seemingly minuscule decisions made for the group that she didn't prefer.  Her mood can be soured for a whole day if something like this occurs.  Growling, rudeness, and just generally behaving unpleasant is very common.  Nearly every morning when I wake her up for school she starts the day with yelling at me to leave the room or refusal to begin her routine.   She is brutally shy around adults and has a phobia level fear of pain.  If she get a minor scratch she may limp around the house for hours or refuses to take a bath for days because of the pain water causes on a skinned knee.  Taking her to get vaccines is challenging to say the least.  She will almost never ask her pre-K teachers to use the bathroom and will wet herself if they don't ask her to go.  She will rarely communicate any needs in general to her teachers.  I have started play-based therapy with her mainly to address this, but it adds a lot to my full plate to take her every week.  I am somewhat pessimistic on the usefulness of therapy sessions, but i'm willing to continue it for a few months.  I myself am struggling with single parenthood and parental burnout which causes me to lose my patience/cool and sympathy for her which I used to feel quite guilty about.  I'm feeling increasingly frustrated and demoralized and I'm looking for any words of wisdom from parents who have had similar experiences.  I discuss my own issues coping and parenting techniques with a family therapist familiar with child development too.  I find parenting books useful but so difficult to find motivation for so I rarely read them.",

    "title": "I need some feedback on my expectations of daycare",
    "self_text": "The main issue   My 14 month old has been in daycare for about 4 months now for 2 days a week.  So on tuesday I log in to the camera to see how he's doing. His room is empty. I use the chat function of the daycare's app to ask what's going on and they say they combined his room with the next age group up and give me camera access to that room. There are 13 kids and 2 teachers. In my state for his age it's 5:1. I call up there several times over the course of a few hours and no one is answering. I ask them to call me in the chat. A few hours later I get a call from the director and they said they had a teacher out and their phones have been down and tell me this is the appropriate student teacher ratio. I politely point out it is not for his age group and tell them I'm well aware there is a staffing shortage in just about every industry and if they can't maintain the proper ration in his age appropriate room to please let me know and I'll just pick him up. I'd feel better and it would relieve their burden. I also suggest letting parents know via the app if the phones are down so it doesn't cause parents to worry if they can't get a hold of their childcare provider. She agrees.   Today, same thing happened but it's 9 kids to 1 teacher. I call and ask what's the deal and they said they would move him. So they move him and 2 other kids into his normal room then strap him into a bouncer.... He's 25 pounds and walks like a champ. Way to big and old for a bouncer.  He is average size/age for his room so not like he's the biggest one and shoving other kids over or something.  My suspicion is there's some outbreak of an illness going around that has teachers and students out sick but they are choosing to not inform parents.   Am I expecting too much? Is this just how daycares are?   More background if it's relevant.   I've been disappointed with their lack of communication and inconsistencies. There is an app for them to log food, diapers, naps, etc. This gets logged maybe half the time. I think okay, annoying but not a big deal. I'm not sure what he's eating at daycare and it seems like they throw his food away that I send from home that he doesn't eat. I ask for them to just send it back so I know how much he's eating and what I should or should not be sending. They rarely do this. Again, irritating but nothing that warrants a call I think. And in general they just don't communicate. He'll come home in different clothes and his old clothes in a bag covered in vomit. And not just spit up. Like he is sick and vomiting. I told them if he's not feeling well to please just let me know and I'll come get him. (I wfh so would rather him be home with me if he's sick). But they still don't tell me. This has happened several times.  His first day there I saw his teacher picking up him and the other kids by their arms. Like from the ground to the highchair. I called and was told the teacher is good and has so many years experience. I said I don't care, just don't pick up my kid by his arms. And to be fair I haven't seen that since.

    "self_text": "I forget what time my son potty trained, but it was around the typical age. This time last year is when he started being able to go through the night with no accidents and it’s been smooth sailing.   In the past few months however he’s had maybe 3 day time accidents. I took it as him having a lot of fun and not wanting to stop what he was doing (I remember doing that in first grade).   But now in the past three weeks, he’s peed the bed twice at night. Which is very concerning. He’s never had this problem and went almost a full year without a bedtime accident. There’s been many nights where he’s chugged water before bed and been fine, and many nights where he’s woken me up to help him go pee.   But he peed the bed again tonight. Four hours after bedtime, even though he peed twice before bed, and didn’t have water.   Has anyone experienced this, what’s your take ? I asked him if it hurt when he pees (although he’s never mentioned it) and he said yes all over but only a little and wouldn’t show me where, so I plan to ask again, thinking maybe he was just agreeing.  He HAS had a really rough year with big changes. His dad randomly stopped coming for him and moved (we’ve been separated since he was an infant), me and him moved in with my partner who’s he’s known for over two years, and I had a baby four months ago. And honestly there was a lot of fighting for a few months, which has since calmed down, but I know it’ll take a long time to build the trust back for him in my partner.   Has anyone else been through this? What do I do? I feel so bad, I cleaned him and the mattress and now he’s sleeping next to me. I’ll have a talk with him about not drinking before bed and I’ll do more potty checks. I also already made an intake therapy appointment so we can help him work through his dad leaving and some of his other stressors. I don’t know if I should make a pediatrician appointment to rule out anything physical even though I would guess it’s stress. Could sugar be behind this too?   I just want him to feel good and he gets so sad when he pees. Anything is helpful. Thank you.",

Tonight after dinner, we told our 12 year old and 6 year old what we'd be doing, so they would know exactly where to find us if they needed us, and that we were taking the baby with us. Shockingly, they are not good listeners and did not pay a bit of attention to this announcement.  Shortly after we've gone to the sunroom, 6 asks 12 where we went. 12 shrugs, and says she doesn't know, and goes back to playing games.   At some point, 12 yr old notices from her room that we are out there, and comes out to ask what we're doing. We explain what we're doing (again) and ask if she wants to help. She says Absolutely Not, and returns to gaming. She does not update her little brother on our whereabouts because that's just silly.  Finally, we're done, and go back inside and into the living room where our 6 year old jumps up and runs to hug us and we realize he's been crying. I need you guys to understand this whole timeline is like...45 minutes. It's not like we vanished for hours.   He thought we'd simply left them alone for the night and weren't coming back until morning. He was literally in the middle of writing a letter that was like \"I love you mom, I love you dad, I'm glad you came home today, I got kind of scared.\" with hearts and everything. He was so stressed, and all he could think to do was write a letter for when we came back.   We reassured him a million times that we would never do that and I had to fight the urge to drop everything and take him out for ice cream and a new toy at the ungodly hour of 8pm.

    "self_text": "How do you deal with negative comments from BM and specifically BM’s boyfriend around the kids?  Tonight SD’s BM facetimed right around her bedtime so she could catch up with her and her other siblings. They pretty much talk daily.  They talked about Halloween and SD was excited to show them how much candy she got with us and BM’s bf/baby daddy said “They ACTUALLY do Halloween THERE?” BM and her bf came to our town ONE time to see SD for her Birthday and made fun of how we live “in the middle of nowhere and there’s nothing to do”.   We do not comment negatively on where they live, them or their families so I don’t know why he thinks it’s necessary. He’s younger than all of us (BM, my DH and myself) by like 10 years and he has been in a relationship for shorter than any of us (couple years) so I guess he think’s its funny or cool to make those comments.  I couldn’t keep my mouth shut, they were on facetime and I said “Yea, it’s a pretty big deal in this neighborhood.” And he got quiet and SD asked “Why wouldn’t they?” Because she was genuinely confused on why he said that. Then they started asking her if we make her do any chores here and when she said yes, they told her she was lying 🙄  When they came for her birthday and heard she was exercising and doing crossfit with her dad, SD asked BM’s bf if he knew what deadlifts were cuz she was going to tell him how she did them. He said “Yea I do. I could outlift your dad. I mean, probably because I’m so much younger than him.” My DH was a Marine for 20 years and has placed in crossfit competitions and has a personal coach he works with, so, no he probably couldn’t and why was it necessary to even say that?  Then he told my SD if anyone got an art degree (which is something she is interested in) they are basically throwing their money away. BM isn’t even paying for a car or college and either is her bf, we are taking on that whole bill. We told BM, we support her in whatever she wants to do and if its art, that’s great! You can use that degree for many things and no one that isn’t paying for her education really gets any say.  How do you keep those comments from bothering you? It upsets me and makes me feel bad for my SD. We don’t even get CS from BM or help with any bills and her BF doesn’t pay for anything for her (although they let her think all the softball gear we bought for her was from them) so I don’t understand why he is continually bashing on us and then acts all nice to our face when we meet in person.   I went to shake his hand when I first met him and BM in person(we lived in seperate states for years). BM was quiet and shook my hand, but her bf looked confused and then disgusted and didn’t shake my hand. I’ve been with my DH for 6 years, BM’s bf has been around 3 from when he got her pregnant while she wasnt fully split up from her second baby daddy until now. Not sure why he thinks he is better than everyone else and acts rudely.  I don’t want SD to think she can’t talk about them around me, but everytime she tells me about something negative her mom’s bf says it just angers or annoys me!",

    "self_text": "I’m coming off maternity leave after this week sadly grateful to be out of my house no longer fighting my 2 month old (10 weeks) to sleep all day. I’m just exhausted.   The first month he would only sleep if held but we got him used to other surfaces and now he can’t get comfortable being held. He seems to sleep best in a pack n play or crib but even then will only sleep max 30 mins during the day (maybe twice a day). We’ve tried different volumes on the sound machine, the bouncer (with and without vibration and rocking), different types of swaddles (arms at his side vs up) as well as no swaddles (he just thrashes around), with paci and without (he often spits it out within first 2 mins), pack n play vs crib, tried at different times of day, tried monitoring his wake windows (and putting him down early and also putting him down overtired). During the day, most of the time he won’t sleep longer than 10 mins, about 30% of the time we’ll get a good 30 mins. At night, I (mom) have also tried cosleeping as he will not sleep longer than 30 mins in a pack n play with me. Max he will sleep at night is 2 hour stretches then he wakes up and we’ll try feeding him. The first half of the night he’s apparently better at falling back asleep quickly (my husband does this shift) and the second half it often takes up to an hour. His sleep windows often look like this 8-9:45, 10-12:00, 12:30-1:30, 3-4:30, 5:30-7.   By this time my first born was reliably sleeping 9-4, 4:30-7 and would fall asleep any time anywhere during the day.   I’m just miserable and feel like a bad mom for being miserable. I don’t know what else to do than spend all day trying to get him to sleep because he’s fussy and yawning.   Anyone else out there with experience with sleep like this?",

Twice per day, they go out to the play yard where my 4yo likes to play in the sand and dirt.   On rainy days, the preschool is totally fine with kids not wearing rain gear and getting soaked and filthy. Their proposed solution is that parents send their kids with multiple changes of clothes on those days.   I'm trying to figure out how reasonable this is. My thoughts so far are:   They cannot force my 4yo to wear rain gear (they pointed this out to me this morning). I get it. If a kid doesn't want to wear the rain gear, they cannot bodily force them to and there are not enough staff for one to stay and attend to my kid to try, to try persuade them to don the appropriate clothes, while everyone else goes out to play.  But, isn't school a place where kids learn to follow rules? Why can't this be a rule that all kids follow?  I don't want to have to deal with 2 or 3 sets of wet, sandy clothes on rainy days.

Tonight, for example, we had a lovely evening. We had dinner, sat and watched some TV, turned that off and did some crafts and drawing, and headed upstairs for bed without an ounce of resistance. My wife was tired from last night's antics and was in bed relaxing, so we went in to say hello before getting dressed for bed etc. We were chatting away happily and then she just hit me, not hard, then followed it with a harder punch, and then we were away and she was smiling away while throwing deliberately placed punches and kicks, calling us shitboxes and saying \"I can say fuck, it's the best thing to say\".   Now, we have tried a good few things, none of which have worked (mostly in reverse order to below, having now written it out)    restraining her gently (she goes nuts and starts screaming, getting more and more agitated)   punishments (I don't care)   incentives (immediately breaks promises)   time outs (she follows us, or if we lock ourselves away she breaks things)   hugging (thrashing and screaming ensues)   talking to her when she is calm (doesn't want to talk about it, says she doesn't know why)    We really don't know what to do. We are struggling to get her into school every day, she won't go to bed on time so she's tired in the morning, making that worse. I'm really worried about her.

I’m now 29 and I’ve had a lot of therapy to work through those things because I knew I wanted to BE better for whatever future children I had. I now have a 2 year old and while I’m certainly not worlds best mom, I consider myself to be a good mom because I know I’m doing my best and my husband and I are a great team and we work hard to be good parents. But, the anxiety of parenting is drowning me. One thing I’ve never been able to get over is my need to control situations or be prepared for literally anything. A lot of this stems from severe lack of structure as a kid. And as we know, with parenting comes so many unexpected turns. I work full time as a HR manager as a law firm and I have a great boss who is flexible with me when my daughter is sick and doesn’t give me any problems. However, never knowing what’s going to happen as a parent from one minute to the next is heightening my anxiety. It’s hard for me to reason with that kids, like us, can get sick at any moment. Or that at any moment she could go from happy to mad. Or that she may not want to stay with the babysitter and then she’s really upset and my husband and I don’t get a break because I get anxiety about her feelings. It’s all just too hard from me to reason with. She’s been on/off sick for four weeks and I swear I get such anxiety about it. I’m not sure what’s wrong with me. I think I need to go back into therapy but I seriously feel like I’m drowning in anxiety 😟",

When she is frustrated that either my girlfriend or I aren't picking her up or playing with her she will smack her head on a wall or try to headbutt the ground.   If she can't strap her baby into her stroller (the strap is a little difficult even for me) she throws her baby and hits her head on the stroller repeatedly.  And there's lots of more situations like these. We are very patient with her, show her how to do things when she's frustrated, we don't yell at her, and we always prevent her from hitting her head on things as fast as possible then proceed to explain that she shouldn't hurt hurtself when she's upset.   She is really observant, and is always trying to help as much as possible. It's just when she is trying to do something alone and it isn't working she absolutely looses it. How can we deal with this? She is so young that while she understands simple commands and statements like \"go get your toy\" or \"let's put your shoes on\", I don't know how to convey how to handle emotions like frustration or anger.

However it turns out they’re into very fringe groups, crystals and all that fun stuff. (Their choice no hate), but it does mean they are very anti medicine and would not get any vaccines (including the covid vaccine). My partner and I discussed in length what to do and both agreed we wouldn’t be comfortable seeing them (having them around the baby) during the pandemic if they’re not vaccinated. My partner ended up getting post natal depression and was calling them regularly in tears begging them to get vaccinated so she could have more support. I tried my very best to help and she knows that but I also work full time so she needed extra help. Our baby wasn’t the easiest, very colicky. Anyway fast forward 6 months and the pandemic starting cooling off and the world started coming back to normal and now they just come over and act like nothing happened. My partner went through the hardest time of her life and her parents wouldn’t help her and now play the victim card, like we wronged them. How do I move forward now, seeing my partner cry out to them litteraly for help almost daily and now just pretend nothing has happened. I don’t feel comfortable around them.

She missed 5 or 6 days for that alone, where she had repeated fevers of 103°F, was vomiting up mucus and sleeping all day.   She's finished her antibiotics for the sinus infection, was right as rain for a week, then yesterday she complained of a headache and her temp shot up to 102.6°F. At 6 this morning she was still running a fever and she was on a rotation of Tylenol and Motrin. She is feeling better now, and we plan on sending her to school in the morning, but how should I respond to the vice principal who sent the letter?  They had to send her home a day even, as she started vomiting and had a fever of 101. The only day she missed that she wasn't sick was when we took her for an evaluation for a medical diagnosis of autism. I mean, do they really want me to just dose her with Tylenol and send her to school when her temp is 103? They'll just send her back home because she'll be sleepy and whiny and upset to crying, which makes her head hurt more.   I guess what I'm asking is, how do I go about a conversation with the school without telling them they're being ridiculous, as I just can't make her magically not get sick, and without cussing them out and calling them names? I'm so annoyed with them right now. She loves school, we hate when we have to keep her home, and as soon as she's up and feeling better we have workbooks at home for her that are a grade level ahead.

    "self_text": "Our 3 yr old daughter gives us the worst troubles when it's time for bed, she'd rather sleep downstairs in the couch, or sometimes with her brother. She has a twin size bed, and when we switched from toddler bed to this one she was fine, but 6+ months later she will get out of bed numerous times finding every excuse to try and use, or say she is scared of her room. She has a projection night light music box, her favorite \"stuffies\" and her room is all done up girly and cute in her pick of mermaid theme, and she no longer takes naps during the day. She still gets a sippy cup with water sometimes, or just a cup of water before bed. Weve tried reading to her, playing hard all day, looking under the bed and in closet just to make her not \"scared\" anymore. What can we do to end the nightly bedtime struggle?!   Side note: I can see/feel things not many other people can, or I dream the things and once in a while have sleep paralysis with the worst of sightings, been this way since I was very young and my dad is the same. I know kids are more prone to \"imaginary\" friends or that's what the normal Eyed people tend to call them, and I've seen things and felt things in our house, unfortunately in her room, could she be seeing something and not know how to tell us? She talks just fine but she's 3 so not exactly helpful 🤷‍♀️",

    "self_text": "My seven year old son is friendly, empathetic, smart, and funny. He's very much a good boy. But he's a terrible slob and very lazy. He never picks up after himself, leaves dishes, trash, toys, discarded clothes, books, school stuff, etc. EVERYWHERE! He'll cut corners to save himself any slight inconvenience; for example, I ask him to clean up his room, which includes picking up dirty clothes off of the floor. He shoved them into his drawer instead of walking to the hamper right outside his bedroom door. He smears toothpaste EVERY morning and just leaves it.   It wouldn't be so bad, but he's also sassy about it. I asked him to check the mail when we got home & he mumbled under his breath, saying, \"Why do I have to do all of the work?\" GUYS, HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING BESIDES HALF-BUTT CLEAN HIS ROOM?! I was so frustrated & I asked him what work he does exactly. He couldn't tell me. I keep wanting to enforce chores, like I had at his age. But I can't get anything to stick. We had a baby & bought a new house this year, so I'm already overwhelmed. Sigh. Does anyone have advice for me? Please? Especially as we will be hosting holidays this year, I don't need the additional stress of a lazy bones boy.",

    "self_text": "Edit: hard to respond to everyone but thank you so much everyone for your responses. I am reading all of them and they’re extremely helpful.  I know toddlers can be picky, and I always get the same condescending response when I mention this to other parents which is a half laugh and then telling me it’s normal and good luck.   My toddler literally won’t be eat anything except for snacks like crackers or biscuity/cookie like things. She won’t go near egg, meat, cheese, vegetables, nuts. Anything. If I try and serve her anything she starts crying.   I’m aware that the situation is probably stressful for her too so I don’t ever get angry at her but I’m feeling so depleted at this point. Is there any hope or do I just have a fussy eater and should accept it?   The doctor was useless. Said I should give her smal plates of food so she doesn’t feel like it’s too much. Didn’t work.",
