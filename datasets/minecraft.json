I decided to restart my game and see if that would do anything, however when I opened up the launcher it had logged me out, and I could not log back in. I thought it might be a problem with my launcher/client (I use Feather), but when I tried to log on with the vanilla launcher it still would not work. The message it gives is that authentication is unavailable. Is anybody else having this problem? What can I do to fix it?",

    "self_text": "Do you want to be those top g in lifesteal who has 100 hearts? Well, if you are one of those people who want to be top g in public lifesteal smp, you've found the right post.  First of all, press tab and select your victim. Tabs shows you valuable informations. If shows you people's ping and most importantly, how many hearts they have. (This will depend on which server you play) Once you find a poor player with like 10 hearts or newbies, private message them and ask if they want to team up with you. If your victims are one of those naive and doesn't know how deadly the lifesteal smp is, they will say yes. If they get too suspicious at you or if they are too smart, don't go for them. After they agreed to team up with you, you tell them to teleport to you using /tpa. Now, just in case they attack you once they teleported to you, tried to tpa them in the ocean while riding a boat. If they get hostile and tried to kill you, you could easily escape. After you have confirmed that they are poor and naive, tell them to ride the boat with you and go to surface. Then, you ask them if they really have what it takes to become a true friend in the lifesteal smp and become king together. (Make sure to use private message!) After they say yes, you tell them that they have to go through something called trust test. For example, if your victim has 10 hearts, you tell them to withdraw 9 hearts and put them to 1 heart. If your victim is naive enough, they will do it. (the command for withdrawing hearts is /withdraw or /withdrawheart but it can be different in certain servers) After your victim is down to one heart, you just hit them once and get them banned. Now you have their 9 withdrawn hearts and 1 heart you took from them by killing your victim. So, in total, you earned 10 hearts by killing a player once. Just repeat the same process 8 more times and boom! You have become the most powerful player in the lifesteal smp. Honestly, this worked for me every time I used it and I have become the most overpowered player in the lifesteal smp. But remember, it is very important to choose the right victim. If they are too smart, they could just teleport their op friend to you and kill you.",

I am the only one on my team with skill. Every other person is not very good at minecraft and they dont play it much what myself dont play also but i used to a lot. There is only 2 players on my team (including me) that have so far played and there team is way in front  since i havent been able to play as much. Now i now how to grind and today i found a village but it is kinda close (only 3K out) and in 5 days we can attack each other. My question is should i move?

And this is for when she is not here as well, like would I have to make a world and be signed in 24/7? Or is there an option that any of us can hop on the same world at anytime without her being the host?",

Well 3 years of me playing Java led me to forget about Minecraft Bedrock. Now I don't have my Xbox's anymore, but considering Microsoft owns Xbox and Minecraft and they have for a while, I figured there might be a way to recover worlds from an Xbox account to Bedrock on Windows. Without an Xbox of course. My idea was getting a friend to log into my account and put the worlds on a flash drive and emailing the contents to me, but I would much rather not do that. I don't know where Minecraft World's/World data is stored, whether it's on the account, or the Xbox that the world was created on. If anyone knows how, any help is appreciated.",

Let's say you have the Subway Stations A B C A is connected to B, B is connected to C, A is not connected to C, aka there's a line of Stations, A and C being the extremities and B somewhere in the middle, now, how do you ensure that you will always be able to take a minecart from any one point and travel to another? A singular minecart that goes through all stations aimlessly is a no, I do not want to wait for a subway. Another idea would be to make minecart dispensers at every station, and have no minecart run through the subway tracks without anyone inside. But that comes with an additional problem of \"What if a dispenser runs out of Minecarts?\", which is possible. If you were to go from C to A, go back on foot to C and repeat, eventually the dispenser will run out of minecarts, which is a big no-no.  I'm thinking of making a different tunnel not visible to the public eye in which minecarts can be transported through waterways, but that's also bad because the subway is already multiple chunks long, and it's only going to extend even more, therefore many items would be stuck in unloaded areas.

    "self_text": "Basically as the title says. I tried to install the new launcher after only playing Java so I could play with some friends on Xbox. Going to the Microsoft store, it kept telling me there was an error downloading it. (Couldn't install while app is running, despite me literally having just UNINSTALLED the previous launcher and game.) I went through the Xbox app to install it instead, and that got it to work.   Finally having it installed, I launched Minecraft for Microsoft, and it lagged fairly modestly but enough to hinder the fun of it. I went over and tried running Java and it ran absolutely terribly. There seems to be nobody talking about this issue whatsoever, which is odd, because I know of others who have experienced this.   The only thing close to a fix I've seen anyone present is installing the old launcher again. I uninstalled the new one, and tried to reinstall the old again, but it would eventually come up to an error and prompt me to go to the Microsoft store where the App Running error would persist. I decided to give up and just try to reinstall the newer one again, but now the Xbox app was giving me the same \"Cannot install while app is running message.\"   I started this whole scenario being able to play Minecraft freely and without lag or issue, to not being able to install either of them a all. What the hell is Microsoft doing. Could use any insight on the matter, how to install either of the launchers and get rid of that error for example. Thank you.",

My logic behind it is that I already have infinite xp it just takes an enormous amount of time standing still to get the xp. Would you guys consider this cheating in an otherwise completely vanilla hardcore world. Personally I see it as just saving time. I also never actually use the mob farm for resources as a trade off for the infinite xp. I just build it and then set my level really high. And completely forget about it.

    "self_text": ">Like the previous post, this is also a repost from r/MinecraftRedstone in hopes to get answers from both subreddits. > >A continuation of How to make a functioning toll gate?.  In the previous post, I asked how I'm supposed to get the gate barrier functioning by only allowing 4 items to be used as pay for the toll, and how to close it down as soon as the player gets through it. There were answers regarding item sorters, so I chose that solution, and with some twists to make it more like a toll gate, it works!  The redstone mechanism uses an item sorter that allows only the 4 items I want to use as pay, which is why there are 4 hopper links in this machine. Comparators are used to detect the flowing objects in order to open the gate.  It's not perfect, but hey! It's a working toll gate mechanic, and does what I want it to do. But now the problem is... compressing the machine itself. Because it's too darn big for the whole road to be able to have 2 toll gates on each side.  This is what the freeway actually looks like on the server (the entry part which uses the toll gate system):  Left side is eastbound (exiting the freeway) while right side is westbound (entering the freeway). The holes indicate where the toll gates are going to be placed and the fences are additional markers to guide the player when traversing the freeway.  Going back to what I made in the test world, it starts taking up space at the other lane at where a toll gate is supposed to be.  https://preview.redd.it/3mehgoy9au2a1.png?width=1873&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b4b93cd2f7fd47af2cb73540fbe37348365b1e9  You see my problem now, do you?   \"Oh, but you can just replicate it but push it by a few blocks off so it will work.\"  Although that's a solution, it's one I'm not looking for. I want to make a system similar to this but won't take up as much space as this one. It can go further and further as long as it stays on 2 lanes of the road, not 3 like what this redstone machine does.   Question : Is there a better way to build an item sorter like this that doesn't take up as much space as this one?",

I'm doing this on the computer that runs the server and no one else is on the server while I'm trying this.

It does successfully hover for several seconds, but then I'm bounced back right outside the chunk and the block under the sand is replaced.

Instead of breaking your keyboard and crying when you die, I introduce you to only crying! I use 2 data packs in combination with each other, Attrition, and god apple crafting recipe. For Attrition, instead of dying forever, you instead lose 1 of your max hearts. If you die with 1 max heart left, then you are dead for good. Essentially you get 10 lives that slowly get harder and harder. Now i'm sure the second data pack is pretty self-explanatory, in that you can once again craft god apples. God apples are important for attrition as when you eat one, you get 1 max heart back (god apples are still really hard to craft with the 8 blocks causing you to need 72 gold per). yeah thats it sorry for the essay lol  &#x200B;  Attrition data pack  God Apple pack",

I'd like to play with up to 15 or 20 players at at least 12 render distance, without mods (although it would be better if the computer could host a server with some mods). I'd like a computer that is small (preferably smaller than a typical desktop PC), and I can use to host other things like a small web or a small storage server for my house. I need it to have a good value for money.  I have thought on buying an Intel NUC, but maybe it's not the most adequate computer to host a Minecraft server.

The village outcast the magics users with accusation of \"Threat to the society\" and usually do witch trial to whom that thinks diffrent. The book was published all around the village.  &#x200B;  The philosopher got kicked out of the village although there is still some villagers that agree with the philosopher's idea. The intellectual in the village such as Clerics and Librarians start to gather up and formed a group called \"Illagers\" to talk and share about Philosophy, Magics, Potion Brewing, Politics and others thing. The group question the villagers that they are scared to improve and try new things. The Illagers group formed a Paramilitary unit called pillagers.  Illagers start to do military actions(or in terms of training) around the village, Illagers invented crossbow for the pillagers to use. Illagers start to gain more troops for that. Villagers are suspected and aware of this cult. Illagers group have prepared to revolt the village and prepared the government projects to improve the village, They secretly formed a government. When its time to strike the pillagers conducted a battle in the middle for the village. Iron Golem can hold of the pillagers for a while. But not for long before the golem broke, Illagers have successfully taken over the village and establish a new government Illagers also announce the village is a state. Illagers establish a constitution. The constitution allowed the villagers to play with magics and potions, Illagers invited the outcasted villagers to come back. By the time the Illagers use the villagers as labor to gain resorces. The Illagers government have prove that they provide better protection than golems, Pillagers doing well not to be outnumbered by the zombies and catch the robber.  Illagers have a project to expand the village and upgrade the village. Many buildings in the village have been improved. Illagers improve a Indrustiral, Agriculture and Culture.

The Illagers Government were alerted and send many of there troops to fight the golems and the battles start. The village is in a brick of civil war, The villager support the golems by reparing them and gather resorce to make even more of them. Eventually the villagers have take back the village and Illagers have flee out. But the structure in the village were destroy and before the illagers left they have took all the resorces left in town to not let the village grow.  &#x200B;  Illagers still have some small village that they have taken over and still beable to gain resorce from those village. Illagers also have finished a woodland mansion project. The Illagers learn from there mistake and put a study on a golems, Later they understand how the golems works and have tweaks and modified them in to the ravager.

Like most kids, I was big into Minecraft; I loved making a house in a cave and playing with friends. One day, I decided to go on my iPod Touch(remember those?) and see if there were any good apps that showed you how to build really intricate houses/towers/etc. and I find this one that had one of those \"edgy Minecraft\" thumbnails. You know, the kind that has the comically \"realistic\" Creeper in the front.  So I download the app and open it. It wasn't anything too impressive - it was more like a drafting board of sorts for your buildings, but one thing I noticed was that you could read stories with the app as well. I read the first one I came across, which was more akin to a small book - kind of like those really long Creepypastas. Looking back, I am  glad  that I read it when my mom wasn't looking, because it would be kind of awkward to explain the SA scene(no, I am not kidding).  The plot details that I can remember are as follows; A teenager crashes his car(I think his name might have been Alex?) and he wakes up in Minecraft. He then has to build up his village, and has to fight back against this other evil guy who's also trapped in Minecraft. If anyone either knows this story, or can help me find it I would love to hear!",

Now, one of them lost their Mojang account and I would like to give them their old inventory back. It would work to either transfer inventory and ender chest to the new playername, or to just know how to find out what there was in the inventory at the time the backup was made.  We do not have any access to the old account, we only have the name. Is there a way to look into an offline players inventory or a specific file where this data would be located?  Thanks so much for helping me out! And to those saying just grind, we've played a lot and many many hours went into grinding for equipment and items.

I built a classic carrot-farm with one farmer on a field and a second villager behind a hopper-cart as seen below.  both claimed their beds and both picked up their profession there. i traded once with both.  The problem is, that the farmer wont farm the carrots behind him and only talk to the fletcher.  when i throw stacks of carrots at him, he tries to pass them over to the fletcher (and end up in the chest below), but he won*t farm himself.  i left some cropspots empty but he won*t place carrots there either.  Someone has an easy fix for that? :)  tyvm in advance!  //edit: is it possible to grow a second field on the other side of the same fletcher with another farmer?  https://preview.redd.it/6sredxunn61a1.jpg?width=1909&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f22af767ff06a47d8ed5aa682fdba39c2b48187a",

However, recently my FPS has tended to be 'unplayable' (like, 10 FPS) when I am used to a 'playable' 60 FPS (that's what I cap it at).  I managed to make some weird observations after staring at the sky for a while with the F3+Alt screen open and experimenting a bit.   Following a laptop restart, launching the game, it is 'playable' for some time (maybe 5 minutes?) until it becomes 'unplayable'.  If the screen dims before going to sleep, and you move the cursor, it becomes 'playable' for about 2 minutes.  If you close the laptop's lid, then open it and log in, it becomes 'playable' for a bit as well.   Minecraft is using the correct GPU, RAM isn't maxing out, in fact nothing is maxing out in Task Manager. Temperatures are fine, it isn't overheating. I am very confident this is a software/driver/that-sort-of-thing issue.  What might be causing this?",

I bet most of us would be ok with that. I'd accept no updates if it meant not having to sign new eulas and sign up for hotmail and xbox.",

I'm just trying to learn how the marketplace work, so I can use it :)  thanks for reading, and I wish you a good rest of your day!  -Doc",

I have since found out the reason why and decided to make this post informing people about the problem and to help whoever also has this problem and cant find a solution online, like I did.  Minecraft Bedrock for Xbox is missing worlds because of a recent \"Performance Update\", 11.19.40 included these changes:   Performance/Stability    Fixed a crash when using spawn eggs in peaceful worlds on PlayStation 4 Edition  Fixed a crash that could occur when an animated structure was loading from a Structure Block and the player left a dimension via portal (MCPE-132561)  Fixed a bug which caused the game to crash when loading an Arrow with an unrecognized data value (MCPE-157983)  Fixed a potential crash source in explosions  Fixed a crash that could occur when leaving a split screen session  Fixed an issue with Marketplace bundle prices not showing as free after purchasing  Added a Clear Cache button in Storage Settings for all platforms. This button clears contents of Marketplace folders (but not worlds) and might help alleviate issues downloading content (MCPE-54531)  Fixed an issue where Wither effect damage would be reduced by armor (MCPE-159407)   They also decided to change the file system exclusively for consoles (changed from UWP) that resulted in a few bugs mainly, The game wouldn't update, The game wouldn't start, Not all of your worlds had been copied to the new location and Input delay.  Because of how the new file system works you can no longer access Minecraft files from your console and all files are inaccessible through any legal means. So until Minecraft or Microsoft fixes these changes we may have to wait. Sorry!  If this text wall wasn't comprehensive, sorry this guy on YouTube knows a lot more than I do and explains it in a few videos: Smitty058  Thanks, hopefully someone working on the game sees this considering that they have not even noticed on Twitter.",

I'm looking for a tool where I can make an image showing different biomes and shapes and the program spits out a minecraft world representing what I inputted. That is perhaps not explained very well but an example would be that I draw an island with a snowy biome in the center, some plains in the north, and a desert in the south. The different biomes might be different colors or whatever, perhaps I draw the island as a crescent or other shape.   What I am NOT looking for is something like worldpainter, where you're sculpting the world yourself. I'm looking to recreate a map I've been using since beta with the current world gen. I don't want to have to make the map by hand using something like worldpaint because they're not as nice as the vanilla generation in my opinion.",

As any rational person would, I decided that next time I logged into the world I would quickly run away from whatever was behind me incase it was a creeper, but no, I didn't get the chance. The next time I logged onto the world I was back at my original spawn point, thousands of blocks from my house and stuff, meaning that either as I was loading out of or into the world, whatever was behind me had killed me. There is no way a trillion dollar company runs a game that allows this to happen, why does the game not pause in the settings menu, and why does the game still run when I'm loading out?

    "self_text": "Back when archaeology was announced in the initial trailers for caves and cliffs, it was oddly my favourite part of the update by far. I was incredibly disappointed when it was not part of the update, and is yet to be added or even discussed 2 years later. Whilst there is a possibility for the sniffer to pave the way for archaeology in the latest update, I have decided to try my hand at developing my own add on. I have a fair amount of experience developing add-ons for bedrock, so that is the version I plan to use. I want the add on to be a mix of some of the announced inclusions, as well as my own content. I wanted to ask if anyone had any suggestions that could be included? So far I'm working with the following -Dig sites like the ones shown in the trailer -Brushing mechanics and excavation -My own version of the ceramic pot system -Ancient artifacts that can be found and displayed as decoration -Fossil armour, which is a similar strength to iron but provides some unique power -Miners helmet providing ambient dynamic lighting If anyone has any suggestions then please drop them in the comments, I would love to include as much cool content as I can",

Thanks.  https://preview.redd.it/h552yiszc0y91.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e602d6acb3aa15f2c68911f249ca5ee326073aff  https://preview.redd.it/n30cqgszc0y91.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=83f0cdd6760d1a881f5b470757d1e92d39e722c3  https://preview.redd.it/tfq1qhf0d0y91.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e1a2a5b1cff30213375d6acbf472b3a0bd19cef",

Since I have already built in that area, simply resetting this part of the world is not an option. I know I can simply find the right region file and replace it with one from a recent backup, but is there also an option to somehow only replace a specific chunk?",

So I recently made a shiny texture pack : **https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/shiny-mobs-optifine-required/**Ôªø  This pack was based on basically pokemon and their shiny versions and I know they have the different rates there as well based on how common they are. So I was wondering what everyone thinks, should I do this as well? And if so I have to do it quickly since if redo the rates all the shinies that people caught will change together with the rates so the shiny ones won't be shiny anymore  Currently the rates are:    Normal mobs:   1/2047    Bosses:   1/247  I was thinking now to redo this and upscale and downscale mobs with how common they are to come by and how easy to get them divided them in a few groups:    Breedable   - 1/1500 axolotl (all 5) - 1/1500 bee - 1/1500 cat (all 12) - 1/2500 mooshroom / brown - 1/1500 fox - 1/1500 snowfox - 1/1500 Frogs (all) - 1/1500 goat - 1/1500 mule - 1/1500 donkey - 1/1500 Horses (all color varients) - 1/1500 llama (all) - 1/1500 panda (all) - 1/1000 panda (brown) - 1/1500 parrot (all) - 1/1500 rabbit (all) - 1/1500 strider - 1/1500 turtle - 1/1500 villager - 1/1500 wolf  - 1/2500 chicken - 1/3000 cow - 1/3000 pig - 1/3000 sheep    Spawner   - 1/4000 blaze - 1/4000 skeleton - 1/4000 magma cube - 1/4000 silverfish - 1/4000 spider - 1/4000 cavespider - 1/4000 zombie    Boss   - 1/50 elder guardian - 1/50 ender dragon - 1/50 warden - 1/250 wither    DIY   - 1/2500 iron golem - 1/2500 snow golem    Wild   - 1/500 allay - 1/1000 bat - 1/1000 bear (polar) - 1/2000 creeper - 1/1200 dolphin - 1/4000 enderman - 1/1500 cod - 1/500 endermite - 1/2500 guardian - 1/1500 salmon - 1/1000 pufferfish - 1/1000 ghast - 1/2000 hoglin/zoglin - 1/2500 pillager - 1/1500 vindicator - 1/1000 evoker - 1/1000 ravager - 1/1000 vex - 1/1500 phantom - 1/2000 piglin - 1/1000 piglin brute - 1/3000 zombified piglin - 1/1000 shulker - 1/2000 stray - 1/2000 wither skeleton - 1/2000 slime - 1/1500 squid - 1/1500 glow squid - 1/2000 drowned - 1/2000 husk - 1/1000 zombie villager - 1/1000 wandering trader - 1/1500 witch    Creative   - 1/500 Zombie Horse - 1/500 illusioner - 1/500 killerbunny  I'd like to hear what your thoughts are on this and if I should change it to those rates or maybe if I have to change up some rates in this list.

If you don't know, and I probebly named it wrong, a puzzle prison is where you have to solve several puzzles, and each obtainable block has a use.

Bedrock single player. On an xbox 1. And I don't trust map/mod websites.  So any marketplace creators want to make a puzzle map that isn't just redstone or commands or cheats or mods, but an actual puzzle where you have to know the mechanics of each block used. I'd prefer if it didn't have an update theme, like an excessive use of skulk blocks. But more of a viariety, like a skulk sensor at one spot, and you have to name an illager \"johnny\" for him to attack a mob on a pressure plate, and build gaps.  And someone that isn't money hungry and places their builds at a large sum of minecoins  &#x200B;  At the discretion of the mods, a yt playlist with a list of the desired outcome was removed.

U/Next_Channel here I tried searching the sentence \"minecraft is a depressing game\" and only got a \"depressing minecraft animation video\"  \"did minecraft make you sad\" Etc.  Let's look at the opposite side here. The Negative side, The side where our forgotten memories exist, The side where we remember when the aether portal was just a mod.  First of all, Remember the time you and you're \"Friends\" Decided to create an smp? Remember the time you had soo much fun gathering up resources then beating the dragon with you're \"friends\" (if you have one honestly, we all had one. Even online, Irl. We Have atleast 1 friend in life)  Lets create a scenario. You and your 3 friends decided it would be fun to create a server, And you did. You and you're friends had fun making houses, enslavi- i mean making villager houses, Making pens. Doing snowball fights, making farms, Watching as the sun goes down on a minecraft beach you guys made!   but then, The day you we're fearing for. The day that you overthinked when you are gonna sleep. The day where y'all quit. The day where it all goes down.   The server slowly started dying. With sometimes 1 friend isn't online. And at the same time, school also starts, Which means. You will be needing to focus on school so you don't fail your class.   The Statue y'all planned got abandoned.. Freezing in time as the server dies, 1 of you're friends decided to leave the server. Making a sign that says \"Yo, Wsg, I gotta focus on school. I promise ill be back\" Several weeks pass. Server is dying. Barely anyone is online except for you and your very close friend (apart from the other 2) Another one of you're friend leave.   Making a sign that says \"Following the footsteps of someone... Or am i?\"   Now its just you and your last friend that is active. The friend that you teamed with. The friend that was there for you whenever you get trolled by you're other friends. The friend that fought the zombies and creepers while you get armor. The friend that helped you kill the dragon while the rest just minds their own businesses. He leaves, Leaving a sign that says \"We had a good run. But things have to change, Sorry man. I guess this is goodbye\"   You cry in tears. Remembering the times that you we're all happy playing together, if time just stops for a moment and let y'all have fun. You made a thought, Playing as the last person in the server.   You build shrines dedicated to your fallen friends. Made graveyards. Filled the world with meaningless builds.  Who's gonna tell they're great if no one can see them personally? Sure the community is there. But have you ever thought of them actually joining the server? It would be chaos. A  s one final build, You decided to build the statue y'all always wanted. Heck even moved it to the middle of your lovely town, if its still a town even.  No one lives on your town anymore. Your \"Friend\" who acts as the guard left the server. And the zombies killed all the civilians. You can't even protect them, You are making your \"builds\", You finished the statue.  Left a journal containing every history of your server! From the very start. Only your close friend knew about this and he even says that \"its impossible to make such a thing like that, that would take you hours\" and yet you did.   You did the impossible. You place the journal on the lectern. The journal is named \"our wonderful journey\". At the last page There's a message saying    \"Hello. If anyone plays again in this server. Thank you so much for the memories we did, Thank you soo much that you stayed overnight just so we can complete everything i or we wanted. I guess this is goodbye, i guess... We can start all over again. But that's impossible. I can't even contact yall! Anyways. Goodbye lovely server, i hope i experience the joy i had in this game. Soo long\"   after that. You clicked he disconnect button for the very last time...   Based on my experience:)",

    "title": "Returning old player and I REALLY hate the 'new' ore distribution.",
    "self_text": "I can kind of understand why they have done it. And yes, I have seen the charts and I understand the distribution and where everything is.. I just think it was a terrible change for the game. It makes it way more grindy, way more difficult and time consuming to get ores with not enough positive reinforcement/reward for time investment.   Separating out the ores across depths means there is a lot less to 'get' at any given depth.. it means much longer slogs of mining to get anything at all, which means more time/work and less dopamine.. and to me, the balance feels way off. I am filling up entire chests full of cobble or deepslate with barely anything to show for it.   Also, if I spend a few hours looking for iron, I end up running out of coal. If I go looking for diamonds.. I run out of iron and so on. It just isn't fun and it's taking away so much time from the 'craft' part of Minecraft.  The game just feels like chore now.  ETA.. Since I think the general sentiment was missed. The worst part is that whatever you are looking for.. even if you go to the 'right' place for it, in between actually finding it is now just a whole lot of nothing. So if you were looking for diamond, at least there would be some coal, iron, gold, lapis, whatever, to break the monotony and keep things a little interesting and less predictable.  Now it's just tons of nothing and then a tiny bit of what you're after and then tons more nothing. It's so much worse. I know where to get everything.. but the process is now incredibly boring.",

I‚Äôll be playing the Java version of the game. I‚Äôm looking advice for fov settings, whether to use optifine or not, and anything else I should know. Thanks",

    "self_text": "I‚Äôm playing One Chunk on Bedrock and I‚Äôve put the seed in chunkbase to find where an ocean would be. But drowned are not spawning. My first attempt did not work but I thought it was because the version of One Chunk was from a different MC version. So I checked chunkbase and this attempt is in the ocean in all builds from 1.14 to 1.19. The world maxes out at y=256 and my half slabs at the top are on that level. Just below that level (y=255) is where I placed the water, then removed the floor letting it all flow down to these signs.   Any ideas?",
