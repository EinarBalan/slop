Here is the problem: Everything is really zoomed in. It doesn't matter what resolution or screen i use, my main screen is 2560x1440, second is 1920x1080, third is 1920x1080. I currently got it to look right if i use 1920x1080 resolution in game on my 2560x1440 screen.  I have no idea what is causing this. I am using Lunar Client if that is of importance (never had that issue before pc re-install) but the issue is on both regular minecraft and lunar client.  Also, when tabbing out of the game my whole computer freeze for a second or two. Not sure if this fits this question, but i'll throw it in anyway.  Appreciate all help i can get!",

I've noticed a pattern were the spiders would gradually put themselves in the corners of the mob farm for some reason. After many failed ideas, I did come up with a trick to drown the spiders so other mobs have a chance to spawn. I'm sure there's a better way than this, but I found this to be an easy fix for me. Basically you put a water source in each corner and use signs to hold it in place, like in the picture above. I've looked across the web for other ways to reduce or remove spiders from mob farms, but no luck. I hope this tip helps you guys with you mob farm!

Feel free to correct me as I am going to make a few assumptions here since since I haven't managed to find any reasonable discussion regarding this:  Anyway, why hasn't this happened yet? There are a handful of very skilled developers who managed to make mods that replace the existing rendering engine and increase the performance. The most commonly used one (Which you all know) is optifine.  While this isn't the most high performance optimization mod out there, it also adds shader support.  I do remember that originally, there were plans to buy this from the optifine developer and integrate it into minecraft, but because of some disagreement this didn't happen.  There are also other optimization mods which completely blow me away from a technical standpoint---like fabric, which adds many commonly used optimization techniques in modern graphics engines. The results are visible in the benchmarks as it can literally triple your FPS. Combined with stuff like Iris, you could run high end shaders even on mid end machines without much of an issue.  &#x200B;  Why is this under the rug and nobody, except the moders seem to care about the optimization? Some of these mods are even open source and they would be able to integrate them into the existing code base within half of the sprint.  &#x200B;  Another mind bogging problem is if we compare the bedrock performance and java performance---As bedrock is using a completely different rendering and streaming technique than the Java. This could be integrated as well.  I don't understand why this isn't prioritized and why are there no discussions, no feedback and no official information regarding this.",

I was confused, i saved my, world, then closed Minecraft, to have a look at the snapshot's information. When i re-opened Minecraft in 1.19.2 the world wasn't there. But in the game's files, in the \"saves\" folder, the world's folder exists. Thanks for the help!",

    "self_text": "I’m incredibly frustrated, and I thought this was an issue I could figure out on my own, but after weeks of mining in my vanilla Minecraft survival world, I’m at an absolute loss for what to do.   My world is 1.18.2 with cheats-on and normal difficulty. I went into it thinking I just had to mine between about y level 10-15 in the Nether, as that’s always what I’ve done before and I’ve found ancient debris successfully. But for some reason, I literally cannot find ANY ancient debris. I’ve tried multiple methods: the bed explosion method, regular strip mining with enchanted picks, and I’ve even varied on the levels I’ve mined on. I can’t find anyone else online who has encountered this issue, but I’m becoming convinced that my world legitimately has no ancient debris spawned anywhere.   I’ve passed through multiple biomes while mining in this world, and according to google searches I’ve done, ancient debris spawns in all nether biomes, so I ruled that out as a cause. I also wondered if I was somehow using an update in which nether debris didn’t exist yet, but I know it was introduced around 1.16. I even tried specifically mining alongside chunk borders, but still no results. Nothing else in my game has functioned incorrectly, and this is the only issue I’ve encountered with my world.   If anyone has any advice, it would be appreciated. I don’t know if I’m going crazy or what, but perhaps an X-RAY mod would convince me that I’m not. If nothing comes of this post and no further advice works, I’ll download a mod that can spectate ancient debris and update with my findings.  -LC",

I then tried installing the windows 7/8 launcher off of minecraft.net although it worked the first time I launched it.  I opened it it updated and then I launched Minecraft and it worked although the second time I launched it, it updated again and the same unable to update native game launcher message would pop up.  I then completely factory reset my pc and only installed the new Minecraft launcher and obsoletely nothing else, and even when I did this and tried to install it when it was installing the unable to update native game launcher pop up happened again.

    "self_text": "Just so you’re not confused, I’m playing on Bedrock Edition on the Series X. So I was chilling at my pigman xp/gold farm, I decide to walk out and get a different angle to collect the xp that won’t fit through the half slab opening above the lever https://www.xbox.com/play/media/4Y6QAFHHCG Now it’s been daytime ever since I got to the spawner so I didn’t expect trouble at all, not to mention full diamond armor, with a protection 4 and a protection 3 piece among them. However the creeper ( that I personally believe spawned behind me during the day, there’s just no place for it to have spawned and walked all the way towards me, but who knows ) that came up behind me and 1 shot me proved my safety wrong, which didn’t bother me that much. So I respawn and run through my nether portals to get back, and was awoken to a pretty bad discovery, the creeper killed me directly over the hopper system that I designed to spit anything other than {Gold Nuggets, Gold Ingots, Rotten Flesh} into lava, as swords aren’t stackable (Would take around 54 large chests to properly store the natural drop ratio of swords vs gold/flesh), nor can they be sorted. Half of my inventory fell into the hopper system and was deleted. So I pretty much immediately rage quit. To put you into my perspective, I was in no danger in my mind at the time, daylight, full armor, no mobs in sight, and in an instant, the worst thing that could have happened second to falling into an ocean of lava happened to me. So I leave, and a couple minuted later I think more about what happened, I wanted to find out how the creeper spawned. I rejoin and find the half of my inventory that wasn’t deleted still on the ground, which is weird, because it’s also in my inventory. Somehow when I left, I duplicated everything that wasn’t deleted. I’m gonna be honest, I was left in shock for around 20 minutes. The majority of good enchanted items were saved and duplicated: https://www.xbox.com/play/media/25B3S28WGM So in the span of 10 minutes I went from contemplating deleting my world to being more stacked than I was before.  I genuinely feel compelled to put this on the internet, I’ve never experienced this much luck/ chance in a video game in my life.  By the way you can see how everything is set up for better understanding in the video below /   /   /   / https://www.xbox.com/play/media/4UFWLKNF6U",

    "self_text": "I need a specific build type, a puzzle prison.  If you don't know, and I probebly named it wrong, a puzzle prison is where you have to solve several puzzles, and each obtainable block has a use. These prisons are often build out of barrier blocks, border blocks, and bedrock.  I'm not looking for another \"inescapable prison\" like Gaias Vault or Pandora's vault. I play single player.  Bedrock single player. On an xbox 1. And I don't trust map/mod websites.  So any marketplace creators want to make a puzzle map that isn't just redstone or commands or cheats or mods, but an actual puzzle where you have to know the mechanics of each block used. I'd prefer if it didn't have an update theme, like an excessive use of skulk blocks. But more of a viariety, like a skulk sensor at one spot, and you have to name an illager \"johnny\" for him to attack a mob on a pressure plate, and build gaps.  And someone that isn't money hungry and places their builds at a large sum of minecoins  &#x200B;  At the discretion of the mods, a yt playlist with a list of the desired outcome was removed.  Hopefully you won't need it.",

Only 19 of us were online, it was an ordinary day as of every other day. Until our rival has ambushed us, this was the first ever battle on the server. We were unprepared, as all of us were in netherite they struck us while we were in a revien. It was a huge lava revien. There was a total of lava, 5 of us and 12 of them. They shot all of there arrows down so we built above us. We couldn't stand there insane power and numbers, so we died.  My whole team respawed then grouped up brought everything that we can at least fight with. Diamond armour some of us had a netherite chest plate or leggings. But we knew they were going towards our wooden base, the only thing we could do was to light our base on fire and explode it so they can't take our loot. And then we dug trenches at the entrance, we gave our leader a goat horn, so once they would come he would blow it and we begin our counter. We had the most skilled player in the server on our team. We all knew what was coming, our hard work was on the line. We all got in our trenches and we waited, and waited. 6v11 but we were going to take them down with us no matter what. Our leader spotted a group of people on the map coming our way, then we saw the name tags. Our patients for the horn, and then we hear the loud horn. We all Sprint out of our trench seeing that they were really close to us. We showed fierceness towards them, our plan was 3 of us would gang up one person then the rest would protect us while fighting one guy. So it worked we picked one of everytime until on they figured it out. Then they began to shoot splash potions at us sense we were grouped, so we had to spread out. With out this strategy we were screwed, we all retreated into our burning base with fire every where. We quickly came up with an idea to make spots without fire by placing water everywhere in the spots. There would be two per spot. 5v8 We see the enemies run over the hill coming towards our base, we fire all of our arrows and our fire charges hoping to weaken then. Knowing this is our last stand or else we all start over. Then the horn is played, they came charging at us, but they were more skeptical and they were all together. They fought on zone all together so then the other zones would incircle them. So once the enemies surrounded the zone they put out the fire that was protecting them. So all of the other zones came behind the enemies And critted them over and over again. Eventually killing them, two of them survived and we let them flee. There was four of us left and we marked the impressive victory and this made us stand as the most fierce faction on the server.",

And I'm kinda surprised how everyone is falling into nostalgia fashion.  I mean it's okay if you like to went into nostalgia, but... I saw sadder moments.",

    "title": "Version Quest",
    "self_text": "For those of you seeking a challenge, I present to you a new way to play Minecraft Java: Version Quest.  Since the Java launcher lets you choose any Minecraft version including old ones, I designed a challenge to revisit the days of old. Rules:   Begin in release 1.0.  Each version has a task list.  You may upgrade your world to the next version any time after completing the version's Todo list.  Your ultimate goal is to complete the Todo list of the latest version.   The Todo list: 1.0:   Kill the ender dragon 1.1:  Craft a golden apple  Obtain all 16 colors of sheep  Build melon and pumpkin farms 1.2:  Build an iron golem  Get a cat 1.3:  Trade with villagers  Loot a jungle temple and a desert temple 1.4:  Find a witch hut and kill the witch  Build and activate a beacon 1.5:  Build an item sorting system 1.6:  Tame and ride a horse  Use a name tag to name any pet 1.7:  Build a map wall that is at least 3x3 maps in size  Acquire dark oak and acacia wood 1.8:  Raid an ocean monument killing all three elder guardians and stealing the gold  Build a flying machine  Acquire andesite, diorite, and granite 1.9:  Respawn the dragon and kill it again  Find and end city with a ship and get an elytra 1.10:  Find an igloo  Kill a stray, polar bear, and husk 1.11:  Find a woodland mansion and kill all the illagers inside  Acquire a shulker box 1.12:  Get a new color of bed  Acquire glazed terracotta and use it in a build 1.13:  Kill a phantom  Craft a turtle shell  Build a max-level conduit  Acquire a trident 1.14:  Get a pet fox  Find a new village  Complete a raid 1.15:  Set up a bee farm  Acquire some honey 1.16:  Obtain soul speed enchantment  Acquire a full set of netherite armor  Raid a bastion 1.17:  Build a lightning rod  Obtain a spyglass  Use a glow ink sac on a sign  Catch an axolotl 1.18:  Travel to new terrain and admire the biome blending  Dig to the bottom of the world  Find a lush cave and dripstone cave 1.19:  Acquire all three variants of frog lights  Acquire and play a goat horn  Explore an ancient city  Kill a warden   Other rules:   Minor versions (1.2.2, 1.2.3, ect) are skipped.  When upgrading you upgrade to the latest minor version (1.0.1, 1.1, 1.2.5, 1.3.2, ect).  You are not required to upgrade immediately upon completing a version's checklist; you may wait until later.  You may not downgrade versions at any time.  Glitches are acceptable as long as they are not serious exploits (such as item duplication).  Examples of acceptable glitches include using tall flowers to place floating sand or gravel as well as bud pistons.  This rule does not apply if you are using an alternate task list focusing on glitches.  (Optional) Every time you upgrade versions, you build a new base over in terrain generated by the new version and live there for that version.  This can be a great way to get new terrain features and structures without having to travel farther and farther each time.  (YouTubers only) If you are doing a hardcore run and using an alternate task list based on glitches, corrupting a world to the point of being unplayable counts as a death.   Variations: This challenge can be varied greatly.  The primary way to vary the challenge would be to change the task list.  This can also include adding earlier versions such as alpha and beta, adding minor versions, or having a theme (such as earn all achievements or focus on bugs/glitches).  The task list I included with this post is currently the official default task list, but will need to be extended in the future as more updates come out.  Minecraft Java is unique for its ability to let players play any old version, so we might as well capitalize on that ability.",

Bedrock is running well on it, no imput lag etc. So I was expecting a even better expereience on my PC (literraly the double of RAM) but NO! It's umtra OMEGA laggy, I click on W to go forward and 5s later my character is going forward for 10s (not pressing W anymore). So I disabled in the setting folder the V-SYNC. I join my world and it's less laggy, but still a LOT. I alrready updated all my graphic cards etc. And when I join my world, the first 10s it's SOOO smooth, no lag at ALL, then it's starting getting laggy. Help please! (No jokes please, just want some REAL help, why Bedrock is shit on my new PC better than the old one? makes no sense?)  EDIT: Playing with same video settings, lowest render distance and tried on both to disable/enable things like fancy graphisms and smooth lightning, almost no difference.",

I had a realm that opened briefly before the 1.19.30.21 update and had no issues initially whatsoever when it came to lag. It was super smooth the first few weeks of the realm. Once the update released though, I first noticed that music disks would struggle to play without glitching and repeating themselves (like a broken record) I first thought it might have something to do with the mob count in the area because of villagers and such, but after testing it in an isolated area it still kept up. Then it got worse and started affecting other gameplay (sound delay, delay for placing and destroying blocks, items not being moved in inventory, not being able to eat, etc.). After that started up I thought that it might’ve had something to do with the render distance being increased from 10 chunks to 12. That was a few months ago.   Now, I just started a single player non-realm world and the issue is still here if not worse than before. I have tried every trick in the book it feels to get rid of the lag but nothing is working. Is it my internet or is there an underlying bug on PS4 Minecraft that I’m not aware of..?    Thanks guys :)",

I did not think this plan through and did not understand how much of a work is ahead of me. I dig out the chunk to the Y 37, but this chunk was in the middle of the huge cave system.  Just to make it clear, my plan is to make the farm at height 37 and build an AFK platform 127 block above the farm. Make Nether portals to bring the slimes to my afk platform and kill them there.   I started to lit up the whole cave and the surface as well. It probably took me a good 4-5 hours. I was searching for more efficient ways to do this, so I installed a bunch of mods that showed me the 128 blocks despawn sphere and the light level of every block. It helped a lot.  Then I realized its not enough, so I spent another 2 hours looking for and installing another mod that would show every entity 128 blocks radius around me. Again, it helped me find a bunch of dark places in the area for mobs to spawn, which I lit up, but it still isn't enough. There are still mobs spawning somewhere in the caves, just individual 0-light level block that would spawn mobs, and there a lot of them. No matter how much I try to eliminate those spawnable areas, there are still more mobs spawning in random places.   With this I want to say that I am really close to giving up. Maybe I would be able to complete this process in 30 minutes, but it also could take me an eternity to find every spawnable block. I don't know. I probably spent a good 10 hours on this already, I am really tired. I don't know what to do.   If I give up completely, I will just make a farm in the swamp. Which is way less efficient in terms of slimes/hour and I would have to fly 1500 blocks every time, while slime-chunk farm is just 200 blocks away from my base.   &#x200B;  I don't know if I am looking for advice, or I just wanted to vent this out. If anyone has any ideas or suggestions, I would gladly take them, but I just don't see how this situation can be fixed.   Thank you.",

    "self_text": "Kinda a hard thing to explain, but Me and a group of friends have been playing Stoneblock 3 with a few extra mods added, most notably the \"Essential\" mod, allowing for LAN worlds to be played online, with friends. The issue we've been having is rather weird. Most likely a simple Syncing issue. Anytime anyone but myself (Host) places or changes blocks in the world, other players don't always see the changes. Something like breaking stone works fine, but placing new blocks doesnt show up. Sometimes stone will stay after breaking, and just Right Clicking causes it to appear normally. Rejoining sometimes fixes it, and I myself always see any changes made to the world. This originally didn't happen when we had only my friend and myself, but as more players joined the world, it just randomly stopped syncing.  I've played thousands of hours of modded, and tinkered plenty, and I've only had this happen very very few times. Sometimes it'd be as simple as making a new world, but I haven't found anything. No added mods have been causing it, and I'm at a loss for the problem. Everyone has the exact same mods, versions, folders, etc. All direct copies. Previous worlds with Myself and User 1 have been fine. Worlds with Myself, User 1, and User 2 have also been fine. But now with the current world, we have 5 Users total, and its being weird.  Really would like to hear if anyone has had this/similar issue, and if they've found fixes or such for it. Not expecting to get much though, as it is a very strange issue, and I can't seem to find anything using google. :/",

I have render distance down to 2 chunks, and most settings set to fast that I could find. Even after setting everything to that, I only got the game to sometimes give me 11fps. What can I do to improve the framerate? Preferably at least up to 30?  Edit: So I'm getting down voted, that's nice. Figured I'd add some more information, the setup I'm running is for a horror experience, hence why I'm not budging on the shaderpack (I'm assuming I'm getting down voted for the more obvious solutions that would most certainly fix the problem, but cut out the entire point of what I'm trying to do here.) I have optifine obviously to run shaders but everything is set to a lower quality and still makes no difference and I'd like to understand why. My gpu and cpu are pretty damn good from my understanding, yes it may not be the 3090 but still it should be capable of running this stuff when I can run Stray, COD Black Ops 3, Doom Eternal, and other more modern games just fine. The mods I'm running also shouldn't be too intensive either so I'd like some guidance on what I could do to maybe remedy this but still keep the experience that I want to have",

I have tried everything I could think of. I lowered the resolution, I lowered all the graphical settings, I deleted and reinstalled the texture pack, and none of that worked. The only two things I haven't tried yet that I can think of are trying to move my television and unplug the console from the wall socket for a few Mississippi's, because apparently that's supposed to clear the cache, or deleting everything related to Minecraft, including my save files, and reinstalling them.

I got to thinking how cool this would be in a hardcore world. If you died in hardcore you drop a player totem that does not de-spawn. Friends must try to retrieve the player totem and quest to build the resurrection chamber. I want to make this incredibly difficult to do. So here is my concept list:   only available in hardcore worlds  resurrection chamber requires some of the most difficult to acquire items in the game (i.e. dragon egg, certain discs, etc... would like any ideas)  the player to resurrect must be online and in-game (spectator mode) for the chamber to activate  player to resurrect doesn't need to be near the chamber, just anywhere. But when they are resurrected they are teleported to the chamber room  resurrected player starts essentially with nothing, no exp, no items  resurrection chamber is single-use only. So after a single resurrection it destroys itself   As far as the toem goes, it should never de-spawn. It cannot be destroyed by fire, and it would float in water/lava. I do think that for events like someone throwing the player totem into the void that would destroy it. Mobs also cannot pick up player totems.",

The different biomes might be different colors or whatever, perhaps I draw the island as a crescent or other shape.   What I am NOT looking for is something like worldpainter, where you're sculpting the world yourself. I'm looking to recreate a map I've been using since beta with the current world gen.

    "self_text": "I have been trying to get Netherite items on several marketplace worlds (Extreme Raft Survival, Raft World etc) but they appear to be missing entirely.  When using \"/give\" in operator mode, all of the items starting with the word \"netherite\" are missing in the autocomplete, and when typing in \"/give @p netherite_sword 1\" manually it returns a \"Syntax Error\", despite being the correct syntax for this edition. I also tried creating the world multiple times, both on iPad and PC, and toggled various cheats/features on/off, all to no avail.  However, when creating a blank world from scratch (not using marketplace), all of the \"netherite\" items appear in the \"/give\" autocomplete without any issues.  I attempted to look at the source code for these two marketplace worlds, to see if there was perhaps some restrictions added, but discovered they are encrypted. So then I looked through various developer forums to see whether \"disabling\" netherite based items is something that's common for marketplace creators, but it doesn't appear to be. I also spent a few hours trawling through all the available /commands, both documented and undocumented, and found nothing out of the box for disabling/enabling items in a world. I also can't think of any reason why a developer would disable those items specifically, or any confirmation that developers are able to do this. Even for the plugins which restrict certain items from gameplay, they would still show up in /give afaik.  When searching Reddit and Google to see if anyone else has ran into this problem, there appears to be several posts over the years of people running into bugs and glitches that could cause issues with Netherite items, but with no clear answer as to why this happens.  Could anyone shed some light on why Netherite items are not working on marketplace worlds, and potentially how to fix this?",

    "self_text": "Ok hear me out!  (context: the builders refer to the creatures that are of the same race as the main character who are known to have created the mine shafts, strongholds, and temples)  I believe that the magic system is based on memories, every time you enchant you give up your memories as energy, and when you mine ores, harvest crops, and trade with villagers you gain useful memories to be used as energy. It makes sense as to why you gain experience from so many different tasks.  I know experience also isn't just a game mechanic like leveling in an RPG because other civilizations like the villagers, villagers, drowned, and builders know how to harness it into enchantment magics. It also is influenced by gravity and drops pi of things so it's clearly real in the lore.  Enchantment uses up experience like a currency, implying that the memories of fallen foes and objects are being consumed and burned as a type of magical energy.   Also unlike every other creature encountered, a new player has no experience or memory. they're a blank slate despite them clearly being an adult, suggesting this person you play as likely had a life before their life in the overworld. But what happened to those memories or experiences, where did they go?  It all makes sense now. Whether by ignorance or overuse the player lost all of their memories enchanting, forgetting who they were and the life they once had.  Don't stop reading  The rabbit hole goes even deeper. Why is it that the player only seems to have a basic knowledge of how to read enchantment runes with results sometimes still being unpredictable? Why is it that the player doesn't know how to make anything highly complex like saddles, music disks, or name tags despite the other builders having had been able to make these artifacts?   Because they forgot. They forgot how to read, how to make some items, they even forgot their own name. Maybe even a husband, wife, or kids they once had. Everything gone, reduced to enchants.  I have one last even more crazy claim to make. The builders aren't gone they're just somewhere else. A mighty civilization that conquered the entire overworld, seemingly, and the end and nether can't just be wiped out or die off. The all went somewhere else, migrated to a new place.  I think you see where I'm going with this.  Along with the other items constructed by the builders, the player also forgot how to create powerful artifacts of the builders like the elytra and the end portals so is it really that far-fetched to think that the builders created other kinds of portals and possibly left the overworld altogether?  So let's break it all down, the main character of Minecraft is a builder whose memories were consumed by enchanting with their own memories, trapped in the overworld and separated from their people forever because the knowledge of how to create portals like the end portal were consumed.",

When the warden kills something, it explodes into dust, and the souls become trapped in the dust, creating soul sand, which brings in part 2, which is the theory that wardens were officially from the nether, which would explain the soul sand, so the warden would have been from soul sand valley, explaining the blue colour, which would also explain those the warden got its power, from the souls catching fire. The wardens must have needed to get to the overworld some way, and that might explain the large structure in the middle of the deep dark. Part 3 is that the warden had to escape because they were killing too many things, corrupting the nether, explaining the fossils from the soul sand valley, why there are so many mobs in the nether now, because the wardens have moved out, and why there are next to no mobs in the deep dark. Part 4 of the theory is that the nether has been slowly repairing itself, as well as corrupting itself, with the crimson and warped forests being signs that it has repaired itself, the basalt deltas and soul sand valleys are proof that the nether is still corrupted, with the nether wastes biome being somewhere between the 2. Part 5 is skulk sensors and shriekers, skulk sensors are plants that were genetically modified to be able to survive without water, and to become hypersensitive to vibrations. When the portal was opened allowing the wardens to go to the overworld, some skulk latched onto the plants, creating the sensors. The shriekers were modified from the sensors, and the wardens used this to their advantage to transport around the deep dark, when the sensors get set off.",

If you are already signed in then good for you! Click \"play\" then click on \"get realms\". After that if you go down enough on the first tab you can see \"start free trial\" or something like that and you want to click it which will redirect you to the ps store and you want to accept the subscription. Then you will be able to make a realm! If you want to go on a different device then go ahead but you will need the same Microsoft account or give yourself an invite link! The.

    "self_text": "Hi, I’ve recently been thinking about the versions of Minecraft before ‘Bedrock Edition’ came out. I genuinely appreciated those versions and been longing to play them again, but ever since the ‘bedrock editions’ came out on all next gen platforms those old versions exclusive to their platform have been discontinued, at least it has been for the switch version. There must be a way to still get a hold of a copy, and yes I already know you could only get it digitally through the Nintendo eShop before. I haven’t contacted Minecraft themselves about this question, but if there’s anyway I can get ahold of that version it would be VERY very fulfilling.  Edit 1: To be Clear I do already own Minecraft on Switch also knows as the bedrock edition.",

The thing is, it didnt used to be this bad, but the past couple updates, especially the caves and cliffs update, have made this way worse. Now even the creative inventory is glitchy when moving the cursor around.   Also, the chunks load really slowly when flying an elytra or flying in creative. I can not believe mojang lets minecraft run this badly, especially on a console that’s perfect for games like minecraft.",

I want to come back for the nostalgia.  I remember that in their shrinking down series, there was an episode where they went camping and fought scorpions. There was also an episode where they tried to push their house using a giant piston. The last episode I watched had them in a palm tree with some camel.

    "self_text": "Hey everybody!  I've been working on creating a Minecraft server installer which can be used to host a private Minecraft server and I wanted to share it with you guys :).  It all started with a friend of mine asking what's the cheapest way to host a Minecraft server for his nephew and I thought that running it as a Docker image (https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-server) could be pretty straight forward and easy to implement.  Considering that my friend that's going to maintain this server is not really familiar with Linux or Docker, I had to think of a way to make it simple. So, I've tried to accomplish it with a BASH script that will start the server with one command. This is a pretty new project and it requires a lot of work! So expect it to grow over time :D  As for now, I've only tested it on a Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB RAM) and it works pretty good. I still need to do a few tests to make sure the performance of the server will be great out of the box when running the script, that it will work on different environments (ARM/AMD) and also the maintenance will be as simple as possible.  In addition to the installation script, I've created two scripts to backup the servers data on a daily basis and restore it using one command (mc-restore), to help new users to overcome data corruption issues and get back to their gaming ASAP :)  In addition, I'm waiting for him to create a free Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (which is a could provider)  account, so I can test it on different operating systems.  You can check the GitHub repo here - https://github.com/davidpinhas/mc-server.  Feel free share your thoughts and let me know what you think!  Plans for the future:   Create a Terraform configuration to spin up a secure architecture to deploy the Minecraft server.   Add support for major operating systems (Windows, Linux Debian/Ubuntu/Centos).   Update the documentation and add steps on how to create a free tier Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account (https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/).",

They respawn too quick and they all count to level 1.   Is there a way to fix this? Or should I make a separate farm for raids alone?   And another thing I'm less worried about is how much they clog up the system.   Credit to Mysticat on YT for the inital idea.

I'm also wanting to be able to label ocean regions, terrestrial regions like ice spikes, and maybe also nether areas, irrespective of the actual biome borders. But I want to names to only appear on the map, not in the world, obviously.  If that doesn't make much sense, I'm wanting to be like an explorer of the 1500s, discovering new lands and giving them names.i have many ideas but I cant put them on signs because that is ugly and signs can't be seen from just any direction.

    "title": "We appear to have hit lucky number 7 (million)",
    "self_text": "Full millions in subscriber count are quite a milestone in a subreddit's growth. And even though we only hit 6 million around the start of this year, today we already exceeded 7 million subscribers. Let's try to grasp the magnitude of this number using Minecraft concepts:   A Minecraft chunk in the overworld is 16x16x384 blocks as of 1.18. If every subscriber placed a single block in a shared empty world, we could fill a bit more than 71 of these chunks. Or, if we filled them only to sea level (Y=62), that would be almost exactly 217 chunks, which could be arranged to cover a rectangular area of 112x496 blocks. If we don't stick to chunk boundaries, that's an area of roughly 235x236 blocks.  If we stored all those blocks instead, we'd need 75 double chests, each filled with 54 shulker boxes containing 27 stacks of 64 items, each.  If those blocks were gold nuggets instead, we could combine them into 86419 gold blocks (with some ingots and nuggets left), which would fill 50 shulker boxes (with less than half a stack of gold blocks left over), so Steve couldn't actually carry all of that stuff. It would easily fit into the combined storage of Steve's inventory and that of a chest boat, though. That boat sure does have some buoyancy, since it doesn't sink with a cargo of roughly 1.7 metric megatons! (A cubic centimeter of gold weighs 19.32 grams at room temperature, so feel free to verify my implied math.)   But let's not forget that this subreddit exists for over 13 years already, Google says it's been 4916 days at the time of writing this post.   As we all know, every Minecraft player only ever gets to see a single naturally spawned sheep in their entire life. So among those 7 million sheep all of us combined have ever seen, 11480 would have been pink, of which 574 would have been spawned as babies. Of course, everyone who is lucky enough to have their only ever naturally spawned sheep be pink, would post about that extremely lucky incident, which is why we have gotten about 2.34 pink sheep posts every day over the lifespan of the subreddit.  Each of us has obviously also only ever thrown a single egg, which each have roughly a 1 in 16 chance to spawn a chicken and a 1 in 256 chance to spawn 4 of them. I'm sure the people who got a single chicken out of their egg where happy about it but saw it as a reasonably common event, while those much luckier players with quad chickens have contributed roughly 5.56 daily posts to this subreddit. (We banned memes about 10 years ago to make enough room for all these quad chicken posts. Turns out we also had no love for spider jockeys back then.)  And finally, everyone can confirm that a player only ever encounters a single zombie in their entire lifetime. Roughly 5% of zombies spawn as zombie villagers instead, and 5% of zombies or zombie villagers spawn as babies, and 5% of these babies spawn with a chicken as chicken jockeys. (I feel obliged to point out that a much larger number of 15% of all zombie babies can become a jockey on Bedrock edition, hopping onto any nearby random adult mob before attacking.) Since that's actually rare, we only got posts about baby villager jockeys roughly every 5 to 6 days over the lifespan of the subreddit.   But on a more serious note, the growth of this subreddit is quite astonishing. While it existed since June 2009, the subreddit only reached its first million subscribers in March 2019, but from then on it has been a surprisingly steady growth. And keep in mind that Minecraft, as a game, has died approximately five or so times since then already.",

A full cauldron as far as I know is equal to a full water block but falling into a cauldron full of water does not stop fall damage.  The llama can hurt you even in Peaceful mode if you punch it.  Flowers and tall grass can get in the way of building drastically as they have hit boxes that allow you to place blocks on top of them when it should be like regular grass placing a block on a grass removes the grass and you place the block in the desired place, but with flowers there really annoying and I feel this is something that should have been fixed an extremely long time ago.  Sprint jumping with ice walker boots across water doesn't work as when you land you fall into the water and are forced to swim, it should work that jumping across water upon landing you freeze the water.  You can't craft a Nether Wart Block back into nine Nether Wart thus meaning storage of Nether Wart is extremely annoying and considering Nether Wart is used for potions it becomes even more annoying we can't store the Nether Wart by turning it into it's block form then crafting it back when we need to use it for potions.

Put the sapling down, then either one or two blocks above it, surround the middle with glass, bonemeal, grows pretty easily. But with Bedrock, I can't find anything that works! The glass trick barely worked, and I saw some posts with using a pillar of three dirt with torches on each block right beside the sapling, but that also hasn't done anything.

    "self_text": "So, I've played Minecraft before but mostly as a more passive player. I preferred fishing and farming to combat, creation to destruction. Even when combat happened, I stuck closer to a bow and arrow.   My question comes from the fact that I'm wanting to try Hardcore Mode and I know I'm going to need early protection in game. I'm also wanting to be a more well-rounded player anyway and want to get better at close combat.  So, I'm wondering which is more valuable? Being able to attack faster but not deal as much damage(sword) or being able to hit harder but have a slower swing (axe)? I'm not including a bow, crossbow, or trident since they typically came after I made a sword and axe.  One more question. I know there is a second slot for you to hold an item but, as I've said, I'm more of a passive player right now so I don't typically need it. When it comes time for close combat, which is the better option? Placing a shield there or a second weapon?  Thank you in advance! 😊",

In fact not a single mob spawns in the farm.  My mob farm was working and then I lightening strike occurred on a Skelton horse while I was at ground level. I fought those four horsemen and when I went up to the farm, nothing. I have been up at night, day. I have changed the setting to normal, easy, peaceful and back to hard. Mobs spawn elsewhere. Even my mob spawner farm (zombie) that is over 400 blocks away works similarly to before.  I have searched online and watched the common fix videos. None of those (that I have found) solve my problem.  I would appreciate any suggestions or links.",

As any rational person would, I decided that next time I logged into the world I would quickly run away from whatever was behind me incase it was a creeper, but no, I didn't get the chance. The next time I logged onto the world I was back at my original spawn point, thousands of blocks from my house and stuff, meaning that either as I was loading out of or into the world, whatever was behind me had killed me. There is no way a trillion dollar company runs a game that allows this to happen, why does the game not pause in the settings menu, and why does the game still run when I'm loading out?

    "self_text": "Do you want to be those top g in lifesteal who has 100 hearts? Well, if you are one of those people who want to be top g in public lifesteal smp, you've found the right post.  First of all, press tab and select your victim. Tabs shows you valuable informations. If shows you people's ping and most importantly, how many hearts they have. (This will depend on which server you play) Once you find a poor player with like 10 hearts or newbies, private message them and ask if they want to team up with you. If your victims are one of those naive and doesn't know how deadly the lifesteal smp is, they will say yes. If they get too suspicious at you or if they are too smart, don't go for them. After they agreed to team up with you, you tell them to teleport to you using /tpa. Now, just in case they attack you once they teleported to you, tried to tpa them in the ocean while riding a boat. If they get hostile and tried to kill you, you could easily escape. After you have confirmed that they are poor and naive, tell them to ride the boat with you and go to surface. Then, you ask them if they really have what it takes to become a true friend in the lifesteal smp and become king together. (Make sure to use private message!) After they say yes, you tell them that they have to go through something called trust test. For example, if your victim has 10 hearts, you tell them to withdraw 9 hearts and put them to 1 heart. If your victim is naive enough, they will do it. (the command for withdrawing hearts is /withdraw or /withdrawheart but it can be different in certain servers) After your victim is down to one heart, you just hit them once and get them banned. Now you have their 9 withdrawn hearts and 1 heart you took from them by killing your victim. So, in total, you earned 10 hearts by killing a player once. Just repeat the same process 8 more times and boom! You have become the most powerful player in the lifesteal smp. Honestly, this worked for me every time I used it and I have become the most overpowered player in the lifesteal smp. But remember, it is very important to choose the right victim. If they are too smart, they could just teleport their op friend to you and kill you.",

Why do I have to pay it again? I paid, you don't let me use it and the solution is... pay us again. Is not like changing android for ios.

Nowhere to be seen. When we went to investigate we did find a sunken ship underwater where we assumed the floating ship was above, but we dont know.  We just assumed what I saw was a rendering glitch and moved on, but im curious if anyone’s experienced something similar. And if they potentially have an explanation behind it.",

If it was hardcore victory would be very decisive but the war may end too quickly that way  *what should the objective of the war be? We could have preexisting  structures/ boundaries that are being fought over for  control.  Thoughts on the feasibility of these terms?

My question is: Is there any kind of Mod for linking Minecarts together or adjusting their Speed?  I found some mods on my own, but they require Fabric API. I just am not good with stuff like that. I can't make it work on our server. I think its because I choose a forge server.   &#x200B;  I Apologize again for my English.  I hope you all have a beautiful day .",

My recommendation is find an area that players wouldn't dig down (so the chance of someone accidentally digging into your base decreases). Be careful planning where you will build this, if it is too flat the blocks you will use to hide the contraption will look only suspicious rather than hidden.   As you can see at the video, there is 4 blocks that has to be hidden. You have to hide the top three blocks (the piston, the observer, the dispenser/dropper) and the place piston is going to extend. (DO NOT fill the place where piston extends)   Be careful with the slime block. Put unmovable blocks where it touches. Here's the list of unmovable blocks:  https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Piston#Limitations  To active the contraption put a redstone torch (it has to be redstone torch) to the iron block (You can use whatever you want, I used iron block to be clear)   Sorry for not showing the ticks of repeaters. The one that is facing left is 2 ticks. Others are 4 ticks  Here's the purpose of the wools if anyone is interested:   Blue Wool: Door Contraption   Green Wool: Slime Launcher Contraption  Green Wool: Activating both blue and red wool  If you have any questions, you can always ask me.

My boyfriend decided to use the nether to cut down the walking time and it’s been great! Only problem is that probably 1/3 of the time that we go in/out of the nether, the screen gets stuck on the “generating world” screen and completely crashes, sending us to the Xbox home screen. We can usually tell when it’s going to happen because the noise cuts out and everything freezes. This only happens when we’re both playing on split screen.  We’ve also been experiencing EXTREME lag when one of us is crafting or going into our inventories when they’re full.  This is on bedrock on the Xbox One and we are playing version 1.19.14.  Any ideas what could be causing the crashing and lagging? Is it the Xbox or the game itself? It’s really annoying so just trying to see if there’s anything we can do about it.  TIA!! :)",

Now https://geysermc.org/ does give us a bridge between bedrock and java but forge mods are usually both server *and* client mods. Is there anything else out there that can help?

I know there's already a feedback page on this but, it doesn't add everything I think it should have.   So without further ado, let me explain.   (In this mod) After trading a certain amount of gold with them (10-20), the piglin will not be hostile if players take off any gold armor piece, or damage that piglin.   Now for the \"tameable\" part.   Players will be able to bring Piglins, or Zombified-Piglins to the overworld. (once the normal piglins are zombified) Players will be able to cure the piglins. The cured piglins will now follow the player and sleep in beds at night (similar to villagers). The piglins will also fight alongside the player, and will aggravate on any mob/player who damages the player who cured it. You still will be able to trade with the piglin as well. Also players can equip the piglin with armor, and will be able to heal it with potatoes or crimson fungus.",

So I did this and it worked and then I went Into the portal and saw the credits for the first time. I decided to watch the whole credits (even though I didn’t know it would be like 30 minutes long) but yeah I watched them and after it showed me the quote from an unknown person at the very end of the credits it disconnected me from the realm I was playing on. I play on Minecraft bedrock edition v1.19.41 on the Nintendo switch if that helps, and I was playing on my brother’s realm he pays for. Anyways, after I got disconnected I joined the realm again and for some reason it sent me back to The End right beside the portal to the credits, BUT I didn’t have the dragon egg for some reason. I think I literally had every single item on me except for the dragon egg. I have no idea what caused this or how this could even happen. I went back in the portal and skipped the credits and it sent me back to my original spawn but there was still no dragon egg in sight. I went back all the way to the stronghold and back to The End but no matter what I’m doing I can’t find the dragon egg. What the heck happened??",

That being said, I HATE the experience system in this game, it takes so long to reach lvl 30. So what I do is once I build a mob spawner farm. I just give myself infinite xp. My logic behind it is that I already have infinite xp it just takes an enormous amount of time standing still to get the xp. Would you guys consider this cheating in an otherwise completely vanilla hardcore world. Personally I see it as just saving time. I also never actually use the mob farm for resources as a trade off for the infinite xp. I just build it and then set my level really high. And completely forget about it. Would you consider this to invalidate my accomplishments on my hardcore world.",

Then you could use them for repairing items when on an adventure, or just for xp.  But I've never seen anyone do this.  Youtubers always use something else, like skulk or quartz, or setting up an xp farm where you spawn and kill a mob over and over.  Is there something I'm missing here that makes no one use these bottles as an xp source?",

View bobbing seems to be the culprit because I play fine when I don't play with it at all, but it just feels soo wrong and I really can't play with that either.   I've already tinkered with most of the FOV settings and know what I'm comfortable with, but I feel like lag spikes might also be another thing. Sometimes there's input lag and I would genuinely just start gagging and feel the bile hitting me throat and it's overall just not very pleasant.   Is there any advice on how I could play the game without not feeling sick when I'm playing it? I hope I'm not the only one with this issue.",

Just spawned that way.  I built stairs and mined my house into the cave wall beside the house).  I had to use iron doors because villagers were coming in.  So I am definitely assuming the green sparkles are a villager trying pair with my bed(s).  And the smoke or whatever is them being unable to actually reach them/sleep in them?  I guess what I'm wondering is how to fix it.  I'm not...killing villagers because they can't sleep, am I?  If I  am  causing a problem then how far away do I need to move?

Normally, in order to use keys like F1-4 I needed to hold down the Fn key too or else the button would make my computer do something else outside of the game.  Sudden, for some reason though, holding down Fn doesn’t work anymore. Since I cant use those commands I can’t do things like take open coordinates or take screenshots. I don’t know what caused it but it happened when I was spamming stuff.  Does anyone know what I did to break it and how to fix It? Thank you",

What could be happening with minecraft on MSI laptop? If anyone has any kind of suggestions feel free to inform :)  (btw sorry if it was too hard to read)",

We’re all a couple hundred / couple thousand blocks from each other and done a couple hundred blocks mining at multiple levels around our bases to try and find one or a cave that leads to one but nothing, we’ve found zombie and spider ones but no skeleton.   I have no real need for arrows from it because a fletcher villager is good for that but I could always use the extra bonemeal, I have an auto cactus farm and an auto kelp farm that get converted into bonemeal straight away but could use way more for other auto farms.  Annoyingly on Bedrock the regular player created dark room mob spawners don’t really work so I have to rely on converting an actual spawner.  Chunkbase only goes up to 1.17 on Bedrock and that search isn’t accurate. All the sites I look at just suggest Chunkbase  Edit - I’ve found that Bedrock now has experimental spectator mode so I’ve copied the seed and then just checked around using that found 2 kind of nearby 😊",

We were also planning to somehow turn the mobs into 2D sprites which constantly face the player, with walking and hurt sprites as well. The hands of the player as well would be 2d sprites imposed on the FOV, like DOOM. The problem is… we have no idea how we could implement this. We’ve tried to find other mods that have done this but could only find the Minecraft April Fools update, which features a concept similar, but not exactly 2D sprites.   Would the concept even be possible? If so, where would we start? A similar concept reminds me of the Nextbots of GMOD… though I’m not sure if they had an invisible 3D model of sorts to begin with.

I understand that the Minecraft app is bedrock edition which is the same as the Switch version, so I l'm concerned that it may not allow mods like PE did.  Can anyone confirm whether or not mods can be used with the Minecraft Android app? My Google searches keep showing me info related to PE.   Alternatively, I heard you can install Java Edition on a Chromebook if Linux is setup or by installing an Android app called Pojavlauncher, which I suppose he could also install on his Android phone instead of the official Minecraft app. What would you recommend?

Also most of our experience so far has been Bedrock on PC/iPad if that matters.   I found some Bluenerd videos on building a castle which have captivated her but it’s like hours of content for a single build. I’d love something a bit more concise so she can have some time to build and not just spend all her free time watching videos.  What’s the best stuff I can share with her to teach her how to build awesome stuff in Minecraft?",

It sounds silly but I have a major startle reflex so I am actually quite nervous to play on anything but peaceful because I can’t stand turning around to something unexpected, even in video games.   So, after all that, can some awesome Minecraft experts give me some pointers and ideas for doing more in the game without necessarily having to go off peaceful?

The farmer was keeping up for a good while but eventually it's inventory filled up and was unable to pickup anymore crops after harvesting them, leaving hundreds to despawn. This is in spite of having access to a composter and a hungry villager to throw food to.  My theory is, the Villager will always prioritize harvesting ready crops over feeding hungry villagers or composting; creating an inventory deadlock. It isn't smart enough to dump its inventory before harvesting, creating a situation in which its inventory will never not be full.",

    "title": "Lots of bugs when playing/launching the game",
    "self_text": "It seems like Minecraft chose to do some really weird and buggy things today.  Specifically, two problems are preventing from playing specific versions.   I can't log on to servers, or at least Hypixel, without getting a \" Failed to authenticate your connection \" error, when launching a modded instance or an old version.  Launching versions 1.12.2 and below get me a really weird bug with the menus, such as text appearing as white boxes and the background being some gradient thing.   I'll now try to provide as much information as I can about the issue.   Connecting to Servers   First off, I discovered the first issue involving logging in to servers with Forge mods when I first launched the game today. When logging on, an error message was displayed, saying: \" Failed to authenticate your connection! \".  This screenshot was taken in 1.13.2, but the same message pops up in other versions.  This error appears on all versions that I've tried, however, restarting my computer and trying to log on with a newer version allows me to join the server properly. If I log on with a version that gets the error, and then log on with any different version, then the error keeps coming up.   Buggy Menus   When launching versions 1.12.2 and below, the menu screen appears very buggy:  This was a 1.8.9 launch  Upon trying to join Hypixel with this very buggy launch, I seems as though I get the same error as before:  Of course there's no way of telling...   My Thoughts   Perhaps these are issues caused by corrupted or missing files, however, I tried to reinstall the Minecraft launcher in an attempt to recover those files, and nothing was fixed. (All of the above screenshots come from that reinstalled launcher)  Another fact I should mention is that launching 1.8.9 with Forge allowed me to see the menu properly, but with the same error message when logging on to a server, and joining singleplayer worlds seems to work fine on the bugged installations.   The Minecraft launcher was also giving some errors that I can't remember but that seems to have been resolved after disconnecting my router from power and connecting it again ~2 minutes later.   What I've Done   Apart from reinstalling the launcher and reconnecting the router, I've tried vanilla versions 1.8.9 to 1.16.5, I've tried Forge and Fabric, where Fabric gave me the error when connecting to a server again and Forge launched properly but also brought up the error, and I've removed mods from my mods folder and launched as just the mod loader itself, but with no results. The 1.8.9 Forge instance was launched through MultiMC, but everything else, including the vanilla 1.8.9, was launched through the vanilla launcher.  I am well and truly lost about this whole problem and I hope someone is able to help me out with this because my troubleshooting was fairly random. Maybe this issue has been resolved before, and is not the combination of problems with my computer and Minecraft that I believe it is, but I also doubt that it isn't some pretty big problem.   Computer Specifications   On a final note, I figured I'd leave my relevant specs here in case they are needed for anything. I'll also mention that I did try updating my GPU's driver using GeForce Experience, of course with no results.  &#x200B;  Processor: AMD Ryzen 9 5900HS with Radeon Graphics (3.30 GHz)  GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU  Installed RAM: 16.0 GB (15.4 GB usable)  System type\t64-bit operating system, x64-based processor  &#x200B;  Thanks in advance for any help you're able to provide!

I don‘t have any other mods installed. Running the latest drivers and Minecraft is on 1.19.2 with the latest fabric version. I allocated 6GB RAM first and them tried 8. No difference  The main problem is that my 99% FPS keep dropping to 45 or so. Not stable at all. Did a fresh install of Windows and Minecraft as well. Nvidia overlay shows that only about 30% CPU are used and 20-40% GPU. They don‘t really change either.  In the BIOS I also turned off Rebar, because it was killing my framerate in FH5.  Currently I‘m all out of ideas and could really use some help. Thanks in advance for every helpful post :)",

I've followed youtube tutorials, Microsoft forums' answers and even in this subreddit someone advised to uninstall the Windows 10/11 buggy launcher. I don't really know what else should I do, since there is not even a crash report or error code.  https://preview.redd.it/2x1ko59p0py91.png?width=1498&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbd0972f51874011dd4815c08e53dc8524ea415b  https://preview.redd.it/vse396lr0py91.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ae35047dfeedd0f8a269ec4b66bcea6e93b6817",

The situation we are dealing with is as follows: I have a backup of a map me and my friends played together a year ago through an online game server hoster (Nitrado). Now, one of them lost their Mojang account and I would like to give them their old inventory back. It would work to either transfer inventory and ender chest to the new playername, or to just know how to find out what there was in the inventory at the time the backup was made.  We do not have any access to the old account, we only have the name. Is there a way to look into an offline players inventory or a specific file where this data would be located?  Thanks so much for helping me out! And to those saying just grind, we've played a lot and many many hours went into grinding for equipment and items.

    "self_text": "Which is Magma.  Lava is what molten rock is when it's above the surface of the Earth, it flows slower than water as it has a higher viscosity.  However, Magma can only be found deep underneath the Earth and its a smoother liquid, therefore it can move faster than Lava but not as fast as Water. It is also a lot more hotter than Lava.  So my question is, would it be cool for Mojang to differentiate between the two and have Lava above the surface and Magma deep below the surface.  Lava would just be the same as it is now.  Magma burns hotter (deals more damage when in contact), has a darker red-orange colour, can spontaneous combust like a geyser, flows faster and when you fall in it you sink quickly down making it very difficult to swim back up, aka, your dead before you can react.   Making Magma very deadly and treking close to it is a extremely high risk.  To collect it you would need to wear extra thick leather gloves and a special bucket to carry it.  If it gets used above the surface it turns to Lava but if its used below the surface it remains as Magma. It remains as Magma whilst in the bucket. It can be used to smelt and when used to smelt, it will smelt almost instantly whatever it is. You would need to craft a deepslate furnace to use it for smelting as using a cobblestone one will melt the furnace.  Any other thoughts?",

But I regularly exercised as tried to only drink on the weekend. But the pandemic really put me over the edge since I had to stay home all the time. I lost my sense of purpose. I really wish I found this game during that time, but I've been playing Minecraft a lot since the summer. And even though I've been going back to work regularly again. I still haven't been able to shake the patterns of drinking I've had the past two years.  Playing Minecraft has helped me work towards something and watch it grow over time. In a time where I feel like it's hard to find purpose, Minecraft has helped me at least get my feet on the ground and start trying to put together my own routines and balance out my life. For example, instead of binge drinking on a night I have to work tomorrow I might work on the village I'm building instead for a few hours. A night of not binge drinking can go a long way. Things haven't been perfect and maybe I've only just exchanged one unproductive pastime for another but at least playing Minecraft doesn't feel so self destructive.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/slieirmpbm1a1.jpg?width=3264&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80fe6233a14d05ba2aace3db68c02fe9d65c979a  https://preview.redd.it/1k3vyfglbm1a1.jpg?width=3264&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=997dfd0ca13676612ac39bdb3275aeb998454609",

I just think it was a terrible change for the game. It makes it way more grindy, way more difficult and time consuming to get ores with not enough positive reinforcement/reward for time investment.   Separating out the ores across depths means there is a lot less to 'get' at any given depth.. it means much longer slogs of mining to get anything at all, which means more time/work and less dopamine.. and to me, the balance feels way off. I am filling up entire chests full of cobble or deepslate with barely anything to show for it.   Also, if I spend a few hours looking for iron, I end up running out of coal. If I go looking for diamonds.. I run out of iron and so on. It just isn't fun and it's taking away so much time from the 'craft' part of Minecraft.  The game just feels like chore now.  ETA.. Since I think the general sentiment was missed. The worst part is that whatever you are looking for.. even if you go to the 'right' place for it, in between actually finding it is now just a whole lot of nothing. So if you were looking for diamond, at least there would be some coal, iron, gold, lapis, whatever, to break the monotony and keep things a little interesting and less predictable.  Now it's just tons of nothing and then a tiny bit of what you're after and then tons more nothing. It's so much worse. I know where to get everything.. but the process is now incredibly boring.",

The only thing that's worked is removing all my mods and running the game with only Forge, but obviously playing Minecraft with just Forge isn't what I want. Adding mods again leaves me with a launcher that loads for about 5 seconds, gives me the pop-up of the Error Code then crashes, where I can't open it again without using Task Manager to close the launcher. Now, I'm working on the 50/50 method with the mods, which is a pain in the ass but my only option I guess.  I don't know the first thing about this kind of stuff, and man,, I just wanted to play something and not be stressed for once but right now its doing the opposite. Is there something I missed?? Have I done something wrong? What am I doing wrong??  &#x200B;  Edit: After an hour and a half, finally got it fixed by just going through all the mods and seeing which ones caused the game to crash.

At first he denied it, but when people started to call him out as well, he tried to gaslight all of us into believing that he said:  \"oh yeah i said i was gonna do that in creative\"  but when we didn't believe him, he said we were overreacting and left. I talked to him in DMs and after a while, he said he would completely remove his OP. But earlier today, I caught him flying and assumed he was just falling (dumb i know) but then later he TPed to me after I wanted him to test out a redstone thing. He tried to say he never said that but I showed him the DMs and he left.  This has been ruining the server and I just want to have a good time. He's the owner so i cant really report it to anyone and everyone knows but doesn't seem to care. What should I do?  &#x200B;   TL;DR:  Friend can't stop cheating even when called out.

It runs 60FPS smoothly without shaders, but when I turn them on my FPS caps around 30 (I have it at 60 in settings). I know my computer can handle it. When I have the shaders on my CPU runs between 10 and 20%, Ram around 20-25%%, GPU is around 40%. So there's no bottleneck on the hardware side.  Any ideas on what I can do to play with shaders and not having bad frame rates?",

Instead of breaking your keyboard and crying when you die, I introduce you to only crying! I use 2 data packs in combination with each other, Attrition, and god apple crafting recipe. For Attrition, instead of dying forever, you instead lose 1 of your max hearts. If you die with 1 max heart left, then you are dead for good. Essentially you get 10 lives that slowly get harder and harder. Now i'm sure the second data pack is pretty self-explanatory, in that you can once again craft god apples. God apples are important for attrition as when you eat one, you get 1 max heart back (god apples are still really hard to craft with the 8 blocks causing you to need 72 gold per). yeah thats it sorry for the essay lol  &#x200B;  Attrition data pack  God Apple pack",

Despite this, the top minecart track, which puts in the things to be smelted, doesn't put anything in the first furnace. It's the only furnace out of  40 that doesn't work.

I was able to see his body once or twice and when I killed him with a potion he never respawned or connected. He tried joining back again but now I don't even see his body or on the map anymore.

    "self_text": "Back in the day, I made a Painterly Pack of my own because of the ability to pick and choose which textures I wanted for every block and item, which made it uniquely my own and something I really liked when looking in my worlds.  Fast forward a few years and it hasn't updated and the creator has stopped work on it, so I have been playing with vanilla textures since. Does anyone have any recommendations for any texture packs that offer some level of customization like the Painterly Pack, or am I basically stuck using a texture packs that might have some things I like and others I may not like?  If it's the latter, where are the best places to look for such packs? I've not searched for them in years, so I'd like the community's feedback on this. Thanks for the assistance!",

Getting a server up and running via Docker Compose was very easy and I was able to login to the running server easily enough.  Currently, selecting the server (via iOS) requires the player to login to an xbox live account. I'm hoping to avoid this xbox requirement just to jump onto my local server. I don't want to deal with my kids having separate logins, especially since they are young plus phones are interchangeable right now.  I've set the server to online-mode=false but it still requires a login. I suspect it's because I've got several VLANs and the server is on a separate VLAN from phones.  Does anyone have experience with this specifically or know how minecraft defines a local/LAN player vs. non-local? Is the VLAN my issue here, triggering the login requirement?",

    "self_text": "Hey all! Any experienced help would be greatly appreciated. I made my first enchanting table and made the appropriate square of books around it. The first thing I was hoping to do was try to get  Fortune on a diamond pick ax. I don't have an abundance of diamonds (thus the desire for an enchanted pick ax) so I was wondering what the best strategy would be. From the videos I have watched,  I think I understand that RNG is responsible for which enchantments you have ( as long as you have a high enough level and enough bookshelves) Is it better in these cases to try to enchant books rather than pickaxes. I have plenty of cows and plenty of sugar cane so I thought it would be less of a waste than putting the enchantment directly on the ax, which would use up my scant collection of diamonds quickly. Am I off on this? When I get the enchantment I like , I then put the book and the ax on the anvil together? thanks for the help  cheers",

The reason the fragments have not moved could be because of the chores fruit plants and they are all being levitated. The effect could have gathered strength and gained enough power to raise the main island too. It also explains why the end islands seem to go on forever, since there a whole moons worth of islands there. The texture of endstone is also very similar to moon dust.  I know this is probably not a good theory, but I'll give it a shot.",

Such a clusterfuck for just trying to play with my kid, why is it always like this with MS...  Please help :) Thanks!

    "title": "\"Bug\"rock edition just stole me inventory of good items and I am devestated - what do I do now?",
    "self_text": "I went to my Nether portal to get some Netherite (I have 13 pieces of Netherite debris stored at my Nether base) after just finishing my perfectly enchanted helmet. When I spawn in my Nether base, I am 100% safe and have no worry about dying and losing my stuff.  \"Bug\"rock had other plans. You know how the coordinates in the Nether correspond to the overworld by the value divided by 8? Well, my Nether portal in the overworld is at around 657, 72, 1451. My Nether portal is at about 80, 78, 183. There should have been no problem. Bugrock, of course, had other plans. The Nether wasn't loading, so I exited the game and reloaded it, naturally. Usually when this happens it puts be back to the last autosave. Not this time.  I ended up in the Nether AT 657, 72, 1451. I have never went there. I spawned in the middle of netherrack, but was able to easily mine out. Of course, I try to make my way back to my Nether base, but fall in a giant pool of lava and lose:  -Fully enchanted sword - Netherite  -Fully enchanted shovel - Netherite  -Fully enchanted pickaxe - Netherite  -Fully enchanted boots - Netherite   -Fully enchanted chestplate   -Fully enchanted helmet   -Fully enchanted fishing rod  I don't even know where since I was so shocked I didn't save the coordinates. It's going to take me forever to get all this back and I'm so frusterated because there is so much else I want to do, I don't want to have to get the books back (I don't have a libarian except for Mending), grind the levels, and get the netherite. The worst part is that it wasn't even my fault that I died. I didn't go in the Nether expecting to explore it, and thus didn't have some of my usual items (namely fire resistance potions). A stupid bug literally cost me my entire inventory. I am JUST SO LIVID.  End of rant, but I ask help first. What's the best way to move forward after something like this happens? How do I not lose my motivation and not just give up playing? Any advice would be appreciated.",

(Sorry about the screenshots, I don't have the world anymore so I had to work with whatever screenshots I could find)  The item shelves are the ones displaying jars, music discs, a crystal, a potion, and a skull. I remember the wood behind them is  part of  the shelves, so they aren't like the ones from adorn or supplementaries.  I THINK the bookcases were from the same mod, but I'm not sure. They're seen directly under the shelves, and I remember they only display books when you store books in them, so they're completely empty by default.  https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/983154284973658175/1005259218724585522/unknown.pnghttps://media.discordapp.net/attachments/983154284973658175/1005259282180231238/unknown.png  Thanks so much to anyone who can figure it out",

The village outcast the magics users with accusation of \"Threat to the society\" and usually do witch trial to whom that thinks diffrent. The book was published all around the village.  &#x200B;  The philosopher got kicked out of the village although there is still some villagers that agree with the philosopher's idea. The intellectual in the village such as Clerics and Librarians start to gather up and formed a group called \"Illagers\" to talk and share about Philosophy, Magics, Potion Brewing, Politics and others thing. The group question the villagers that they are scared to improve and try new things. The Illagers group formed a Paramilitary unit called pillagers.  Illagers start to do military actions(or in terms of training) around the village, Illagers invented crossbow for the pillagers to use. Illagers start to gain more troops for that. Villagers are suspected and aware of this cult. Illagers group have prepared to revolt the village and prepared the government projects to improve the village, They secretly formed a government. When its time to strike the pillagers conducted a battle in the middle for the village. Iron Golem can hold of the pillagers for a while. But not for long before the golem broke, Illagers have successfully taken over the village and establish a new government Illagers also announce the village is a state. Illagers establish a constitution. The constitution allowed the villagers to play with magics and potions, Illagers invited the outcasted villagers to come back. By the time the Illagers use the villagers as labor to gain resorces. The Illagers government have prove that they provide better protection than golems, Pillagers doing well not to be outnumbered by the zombies and catch the robber.  Illagers have a project to expand the village and upgrade the village. Many buildings in the village have been improved. Illagers improve a Indrustiral, Agriculture and Culture. But under the Illagers dictatorship regime they have killed many villagers due to abuse of the pillagers. Illagers also have expanded there territory building outpost, They have a big project of construction in the wood they are constructing a Woodland Mansion using a villagers as a slave.

The rebellion stole some of resorces from the Government. One day in the morning golems from nowhere attack the Illagers's Government Building. Pillagers try to stop them but there was no uses. The Illagers Government were alerted and send many of there troops to fight the golems and the battles start. The village is in a brick of civil war, The villager support the golems by reparing them and gather resorce to make even more of them. Eventually the villagers have take back the village and Illagers have flee out. But the structure in the village were destroy and before the illagers left they have took all the resorces left in town to not let the village grow.  &#x200B;  Illagers still have some small village that they have taken over and still beable to gain resorce from those village. Illagers also have finished a woodland mansion project. The Illagers learn from there mistake and put a study on a golems, Later they understand how the golems works and have tweaks and modified them in to the ravager.

    "self_text": "My name is Hassan, I’m 15 years old. This problem started today, I’ve never encountered anything like this, it’s annoying and enraging the hell out of me.   The problem is I didn’t have a MicroSoft account that I could connect to Minecraft on my switch. I set up everything and went through the whole process of creating a new Microsoft Account. I created one, verified my email, closed out the tab, and my Nintendo Switch was still on that “Two ways to Sign In” screen.   I was repeating this cycle with no success, I would click “Sign in with a Microsoft Account”, go to the website (sometimes via QR code, other times by typing URL), enter the code, log in, and after all that, the switch screen is still stuck on The same screen and I’m still not logged into. Rinse & Repeat for about an hour, give or take.  The reason I really want this to work is that I and my friend Justin, who I’ve known since 4th grade, play Minecraft together a lot. Recently a series of events happened and I couldn’t log in to my original Nintendo account so I had to make a new one. I also lost the login to my OG Microsoft account.   If anyone has got advice please tell me what I can do",

    "title": "No Storage: A Minecraft Ironman Challenge",
    "self_text": "Note: This was inspired by my Old School RuneScape account (an MMORPG), as a DIY Ultimate Ironman, where I created my own self-imposed rules in addition to the standard UIM. RuneScape happens to have quite a bit in common with Minecraft in general: it's all about collecting Items and using said Items. (And, I know that I'm not the first person to come up with this sort of idea.)  The No Storage Minecraft Ironman is as follows (which I shall simply call SIM, for 'Supreme Ironman'):   Rules  (1) You cannot trade with Players in any way, for any reason.  (2) You cannot Pick Up Items that you, yourself, did not generate.  (3) You cannot take/use Items or otherwise that you, yourself, did not generate.  (4) You cannot store Items, etc. in any way (such as Chests, or Furnaces -- though you may still actually use Furnaces, etc.)  (5) You cannot use any Items or Blocks that in some way expand your storage/Inventory  (6) You cannot perform any other tricks to get around the aforementioned, or else trade yourself in some way. To get around one of these issues, you must never Pick Up an Item or otherwise again, after you Drop it. Consider all Dropped Items dead, therefore. If you Drop an Item and want it back at some later point, you must re-obtain that Item by generating a new one. If, for whatever reason, it is impossible to get a new version of the Item, then you should accept this reality, or keep it in your Inventory forever.   Exceptions to the Rules  (1) You may create new Items, thereby removing Inventory space, or refuse to convert certain Items if this creates more Inventory space.  (2) You may take the contents of Chests that you find within the world, as these are classified as Items, etc. generated for you.   House Rule  I have created but one extra rule you must follow. You cannot Punch Trees with your Hands. Meaning, you always require a Tool in order to gain new Logs, Stone, Iron, or otherwise. As a result, the only way to begin your journey is to find a Pickaxe or Axe, or the required Blocks/Items for such. As a result, I highly suggest keeping a few Tools on you at all times.   Death & Loot  When you die, you cannot re-obtain your Items. You must start from scratch. The only exception here is if your Internet cut out or such of the ilk, creating a clearly unfair death.   Difficulty & Mode  SIM must be played on at least Easy difficulty and entirely within Survival Mode.   Goal  See how long you can live and how much you can build/kill/achieve.   Pro Tip #1  This requires a shift in mentality for Minecraft builders, and even raider types. Minecraft has always been about storing up Items and Blocks, as you require a lot of them. For the SIM, you might want to adopt a more nomadic play style, where you only do what is required at that time, for a given aim, and then move on. Since you cannot store anything, in any way, it is useless to have any long-term plans in this way. It's about slow improvements to your game. This is both difficult and yet oddly enjoyable, at least from my experience. This will almost certainly make your Minecraft experience slower, though this depends on what you like to do within Minecraft.   Pro Tip #2  Since you cannot track progress very easily, I highly suggest tracking progress with the XP Level and via building large structures, along with creating the best Inventory possible in terms of Items -- though you are always risking losing such in Boss Fights, etc.   Hardcore SIM  This Mode is the same as above, only you only have one life. When you die, you must leave the world and start a new one.",

We were mainly looking for a modpack that adds:   Building blocks, ex.: MrCrayFish Decorations  Animals and pets  Survival aspects like thirst  Farming+ (new crops and food)   Desired but not necessary:   Create  More Biomes  More dimensions  compatibility with 1.19 or 1.18   The idea is to provide an improved vanilla experience that allows for tinkering and exploring but without breaking the game like most tech and magic mods do, making the player overpowered.

I could stay vanilla and keep the world up to date with the live version, adding bits here & there as Mojang brings in new content, or I could go modded and have some features that were present in the series (such as planes) or improve the experience (Create mod).  I'm testing the waters and, right now, only have a short list of mods that are mostly aesthetic, some functional. I try to pick mods that don't stray too far from the vanilla feel, but rather improve what's already there (roof blocks, chimneys, etc).",

I was just testing enchant levels in a single player world, then this happened. I had the vanilla tweaks texture pack on, so I assumed it was that, well turned it off and what do you know, it is still being happening, I also moved around and turn the weather on and off, but still the same issue. I then removed all texture packs from the texture pack folder, and still had the same issue. I even left the world and rejoined, and yet; same issue. I'm assuming this was caused by a cosmic ray which caused a bit flip and this happened.  TL;DR: Weird rain glitch happened, tested and troubleshooted, came up with the conclusion of a cosmic ray bit flip.",

From there it would be mostly the same as your normal one chunk challenge. This would be an interesting multiplayer experience because everyone's chunks may have vastly different resources that they would be willing to trade with one another. There would either need to be a shop system, or something to prevent players from placing or breaking blocks outside of their chunk. Bonus if they could expand their claim by completing challenges or a currency. If something like this exists please tell me. If its already possible to make, tell me what mods i need. Thanks!",

My solution in the comments  On my 1.18.2 server, I seem to have gotten at least one broken chunk, as I can no longer enter a specific area without it crashing the server.  I will have to do some further testing to find out if its an entire region-file or if its just one specific chunk. Are there any tools that can help identify the exact chunk that is corrupted?  Since I have already built in that area, simply resetting this part of the world is not an option. I know I can simply find the right region file and replace it with one from a recent backup, but is there also an option to somehow only replace a specific chunk?",

So Microsoft didn't add a Bedrock Edition to my account for the Java Edition and instead somehow connected the decade old one, yet didn't give me the cape.

    "self_text": "So I'm very confused right now and wonder if anyone knows anything about this change.  A couple minutes ago I was talking with a friend about dumb stuff we did in Minecraft and we somehow ended up on the topic of music disks, and how I used to think of them as these very rare treasures you wouldn't find often in survival singleplayer. This was because I was a very dumb and cowardly kid who would avoid creepers and skeletons as much as possible, meaning in all my worlds I would only get discs from dungeons and other chests (my friends, though, could easily farm many of them).   Due to how valuable I felt they were, I oftenly wouldn't let them playing while I did other stuff because I was worried the disc would pop out of the jukebox as soon as the song ended and despawn. At some point I figured out if I just left a bunch of hoppers around my jukebox I could leave the music playing without worries, but I still think even that was being a bit too careful for no reason.   This is when my friend told me discs don't even do that, and that they don't leave the jukebox after the song is over. This didn't make sense, I vividly remember discs shooting themselves out of the jukebox after the music finished, so I tried to look it up but couldn't find anything.  Was this an old Java thing? I also remember doing this dumb stuff on the PS3 version, but checking now it seems it must have been changed a while ago without me even realizing and I may have spent several years being overly careful with my discs for no reason.",

    "self_text": "Hello !  To give a bit of context to the title : Recently I've played mainly on Large Biomes Hardcore worlds to spice things up. During my playthrough, I take care of building structures that fit the biome, my needs and the overall vibe of my game (Western landscapes, Villages in trees or close to ravines...)  Of course, I died multiple times, and everytime it's a bummer. I look at my world, saying \"Oh I built pretty buildings, unless I make this world not Hardcore anymore everything will be lost. But Hardcore is kinda cool, I don't want to go back to plain survival.\"  And with a friend we thought of a concept of shared-solo Hardcore worlds : Why not instead of deleting this world I played and died on, I could share it to another person and they could play on it, only that : - the buildings or modifications the previous players (including me) did to the world would be partially ruined, pillaged and aged. Like turned into dungeons or ruins. - spawn world would be modified to not be the same as the previous player's one, only slightly moved (~radius of 500-1k blocks difference from previous one) - hardcore is still hardcore. Basically a new player on an already used hardcore map.  Like that, these worlds would be an extra exploratory feature : instead of procedurally generated structures, players structures would exist (small bases or houses, ruined railways, old ports, ruined redstone systems..) and be integrated as if they were part of the original generation.  Do you know if there are tools, mods or plugins one can use to achieve these results without going in creative and manually do everything listed ?",

    "self_text": "The latest minecraft launcher (and the beta version since a couple weeks ago) fails to start minecraft 1.7.10, modded and vanilla. And the worst part: no error codes, no output log, just a small box saying \"Sorry, unable to start Minecraft.\", followed by the start button showing the loading animation, even if i change to another profile. Starting the launcher from a terminal shows no useful information either. As mentioned before, this has been happening to the beta launcher since a couple weeks, causing me to switch to the stable one, which got updated when i ran updates on my computer and broke as well. For the time being i'll be using the technic launcher, which does work for whatever weird reason.  Because switching to the stable launcher fixed the problem (until that one was updated) i'm fairly confident that my java version is not related, but just to be sure: i tried jre-1.8.0-openjdk, jre-11-openjdk and jre-17-openjdk. I also tried reinstalling the launcher which, needless to say, did not work. I googled the problem, but because of the notable absence of any error codes or other useful information, i couldn't find anything.  Please help, or just comment or upvote if you're experiencing the same problem.  I'll also try figuring out which versions are affected, and will update accordingly.  What i know now:  Modded 1.18.2-forge-40.1.20: not affected.  Vanilla 1.7.2: not affected  Vanilla 13w47a (first snap after 1.7.2), 1.7.3, 1.7.4, 1.7.10, 1.8.8: affected. safe to say everything in between is affected as well.  Vanilla 15w31a (first snapshot  after  1.8.8), 1.9: not affected.  Modded 1.7.10-Forge10.13.4.1614-1.7.10: affected.  Modded 1.12.2-forge-14.23.5.2854: not affected.  So basically, everything between 13w47a and 1.8.8, modded or not, seems to be affected.  Again, please help.",

I have dug all different directions at -51, and haven't found a single Ancient City.   Getting desperate I put the seed into chunkbase, and the x/z coords that my base is at. The map showed several ancient cities about 3km away. Dug to the coords, and nothing.  One of my realm mates does explore overland a lot to map, so I thought maybe his exploration prevented them from spawning. But he says my base is at the edge of where he's explored, and he's only explored on the surface.  So I set my gamemode to creative, and teleported to the coords chunkbase shows for several Ancient Cities that were more than 10+ km from my base. Still nothing.  Is Chunkbase not accurate for Ancient Cities?  Edit: I just used the / locate structure command, and teleported to the closest coords. Nothing there. This is frustrating.  Update: Finally found one! Thanks you all for the responses",

    "self_text": "This post may get deleted or removed since it doesn't have too much new information, but I think it's interesting to point out:  The Ender Dragon is the third mob to have two different types of eggs. (You could consider it fourth, I'll get to that in a moment)  In 22w44a, Ender Dragon spawn eggs were added! This is the second type of Ender Dragon egg, along with the \"Dragon Egg\".  The other mobs are chickens, with their spawn egg and... \"egg\", and the turtle, with the turtle egg block and item, and the turtle spawn egg. The Ender Dragon  could  be considered the fourth if you count frogspawn as \"Frog Eggs\". But due to \"egg\" not being in the name, I don't think it should count. Maybe it should though, since (In Bedrock Edition) spawn eggs don't actually have \"egg\" in the name, it's just \"Spawn Cow\". Maybe the frog could be counted for a different reason, since it has a tadpole and a frog spawn egg?  One last note: The Sniffer will be the fourth or fifth mob (depending on whether the frog should be counted) since it has an egg that will be found in underwater ruins, as well as a Spawn Egg. (I doubt the egg in underwater ruins will be the Spawn Egg itself)",

When you delete a certain amount of chunks from your currently generated world, and come back to that terrain, it will not regenerate the same as before (as it suppose to generate with it's current seed), it will actually be very different, test it yourself. I think this is unintended behavior. I think what causes this is the new system that supposed to merge old chunks and new 1.17-18 chunks seamlessly. The problem is it's doing it when its doesn't need to, merging 1.19 chunks with 1.19 chunks and causing a different terrain every time, when all the game actually needs to do is regenerate the same terrain dictated by the world seed. I hope I was clear enough. What do you think?",

Rules are as such:   Houses can’t be bigger than 8x8.  Houses can’t have more than two walls.  You have very limited building materials those being: Dirt, Gravel, Sand, Wool, Fences, Logs, and most stuff in the Decor Tab of the creative menu(list might expand if comments make good suggestions).  You can’t have farms, i.e can’t plant crops or grow sugar cane or anything like that(Though you can plant berry bushes).  You can’t make animal pens, gotta kill wilds.  You can’t use anything better than stone tools, no Iron, Gold, Diamond, or Netherite.  Can only use leather armor.  Can’t make potions or brewing stands.  Can’t use furnaces, to cook food you gotta use a campfire.  No redstone at all whatsoever.  If a recipe has iron in it, it’s not allowed.   The whole idea of this challenge is that you are returning to a more primal state one that better resembles the early years of humanity. I think it’s a cool idea and I hope you all enjoy it too.",

Would my daughter with the education edition be able to play with us or would she need a different version?   4 of use have windows devices, the 5th has an amazon tablet, would this be able to play together or would we need a windows device for them?

I don’t think this cutter should be able to cut Iron, Gold, Diamond or Netherite blocks because that would massively complicate/break the game’s existing mechanics regarding taking these kinds of blocks apart to get your 9 ingots back.  Thoughts?  EDIT: I suppose this stonecutter could be used to cut all the things a normal stonecutter could as well so, in order to save the current stonecutter from becoming kinda redundant, this Diamond Saw Stonecutter would wear down like the Anvil so people would still be wise to use the regular stonecutter for non-obsidian block tasks.",

When he joins through internet connection, he will join but he can not do anything and the chunks will not load he can not die or break blocks. This is happening only on realms either mine or other friends realm.  When he is connected through mcpe it also does the same thing, so it is not caused by the device. When he goes to other family relatives ( different internet connection) it works . This change is since they changed the connection.  Any ideas would be very much appreciated!",

I specifically cropped what blocks I think most easily identify the unique parts of the pack that specifically stuck in my memory and to be able to see the textures easier, so hopefully that's okay and/or helpful ',:|  https://preview.redd.it/nv757je9kr0a1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=12ee103f8fbe5545476c76e68794a59feccfad14  https://preview.redd.it/owrb3me9kr0a1.png?width=322&format=png&auto=webp&s=a29cab3e39c31b72903c705c9fddabc59a10344e  https://preview.redd.it/z9crhwe9kr0a1.png?width=672&format=png&auto=webp&s=0635243acf0f7473c59c2705fb9102a71fbb07ea  https://preview.redd.it/0iv68xe9kr0a1.png?width=766&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6983c3481b4d877c532f24689d29e7f0d126aad  https://preview.redd.it/awhiive9kr0a1.png?width=368&format=png&auto=webp&s=d10636892b046ff7668eea49d7837fd7c19c5cd4  https://preview.redd.it/o3la54f9kr0a1.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&s=0be6f5fbc5e9a6033df9dcc288fb739e71a49f39  https://preview.redd.it/pvroq5f9kr0a1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=e94d78932a6c46c143c96c6bb35d7be872b58cd8",
